As of Friday, April 17, there are more than 2.2 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.

With more than 16.5 million members, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made many temporary adjustments on multiple continents to help slow the spread of the virus.

The church has closed temples, suspended Sunday worship services and held a general conference that was viewed remotely. A significant number of missionaries have returned or are in the process of returning home for self-isolation, some with the option of returning to fulfill their service at a later date.

During its general conference the weekend of April 4-5, President Russell M. Nelson called for a second worldwide fast on Good Friday to control the pandemic, protect caregivers, strengthen the economy and normalize life. One week later, President Nelson used social media to “express deep gratitude” for those who took part in the global fasts.

On April 13, the church announced that all For Strength of Youth conferences in the U.S. and Canada would be postponed until 2021.

The same day, the church announced a partnership with Latter-day Saint Charities, Intermountain Healthcare and University of Utah Health to organize an army of 50,000 volunteers to make 5 million masks to protect Utah health care workers.

The news came after the First Presidency approved humanitarian projects in 57 countries to battle COVID-19.

The church also released letters with new pandemic-related guidelines for leaders and members on how to administer ordinances and officiate events like weddings, funerals and baby blessings, among other things.
