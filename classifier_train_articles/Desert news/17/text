“I wish to express my deep gratitude to all who participated in the recent fasts — both on Good Friday, April 10, and on Sunday, March 29 — as we joined together to petition our Heavenly Father for relief from the effects of COVID-19,” he wrote. “I was humbled to learn of friends from many faiths all over the world who joined with us to appeal for relief.”

He concluded the brief message with optimism for the future and encouraged everyone to strengthen their relationship with Jesus Christ.
