SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Jazz All-Star Donovan Mitchell confirmed that he was initially angry after the news that his teammate Rudy Gobert had tested positive for the coronavirus and then that he too had been infected.
“That particular school district is home to some of the most vulnerable children in Salt Lake,” Mitchell said.
Despite the good memories and being able to keep busy, Mitchell admitted that he’s already missing his day job.
Mitchell, like many others, called for anyone listening to proceed with caution and to think about others as they traverse these new conditions.
I could walk down the street if it wasn’t public knowledge that I was sick, and you wouldn’t know it,” he said.
