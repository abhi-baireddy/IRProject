SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Sen. Mitt Romney encouraged people over 70 to consider self-quarantine to insulate themselves from COVID-19.
Please, follow strict social-distancing and even consider self-quarantine,” he said in social media posts.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, extended his self-quarantine to March 17 after he said he had a second interaction with a person found to have COVID-19.
A staff member in Sen. Maria Cantwell’s Washington, D.C., office was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this week, the first known confirmed case on Capitol Hill.
Also Friday, Romney joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to safeguard the country’s medical supply chain and address shortages due its dependence on foreign-made medical equipment.
