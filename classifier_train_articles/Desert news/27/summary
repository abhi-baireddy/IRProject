DRAPER — Firefighters are normally training for wildfire season at this time of year, but due to coronavirus concerns, things are already looking to be very different.
It’s completely normal to see some small fires start in April, but there’s nothing normal about the start of this fire season, particularly because of coronavirus concerns.
“It will still be a big meeting, but it will all be virtual now,” said Curry.
“That’s why we are going to treat every fire as if it’s got the potential to be the big one,” said Curry.
“Even if it means pouring more resources in on the front end, we want to keep all of these fires as small as possible, so we lessen the chances of having those big fires.”
