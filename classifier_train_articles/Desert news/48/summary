It’s well-known that stress lowers immune response — especially chronic stress.

According to a 2014 study in the Journal of Neuroimmunology, increased anxiety associated with loneliness also leads to greater suppression of the immune system.
Aerobic exercise can be especially valuable as a way to boost the body’s immune system.
The movement also causes white blood cells to circulate more rapidly, allowing your immune system to detect illnesses more quickly.
