HIGHLAND — For one week at least, Trey Gambill’s senior season was perfection.
“We had an undefeated season,” Gambill likes to joke.
Even though the season was cut way, way short, it ended on a very memorable high note for Lone Peak.
Playing three games on three different fields on that Saturday, Lone Peak beat Herriman 8-7, Skyridge 7-2 and Timpanogos 6-3.
“The things my brother told me is it’s a great program, great school, great coaches, just a great environment for him,” said Trey Gambill.
