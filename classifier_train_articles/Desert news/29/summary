Cosic played in four Olympics including Mexico City (1968), Munich (1972), Montreal (1976) and Moscow (1980), where he helped lead Yugoslavia to the gold medal.
He was the second European basketball player to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1996.
A boyhood friend in Croatia, who followed Cosic to BYU, is Misho Ostarcevic, an international and NBA scout who currently lives in St. George.
