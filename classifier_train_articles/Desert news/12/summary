SALT LAKE CITY — Former BYU quarterback Taysom Hill is set to return to the New Orleans Saints for his fourth NFL season, as the league’s deadline for restricted free agents to sign offer sheets with another team passed Friday.
There were no offer sheets extended to any restricted free agents this year, including Hill, a fact potentially impacted by the league’s visitation restrictions brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Hill was the lone NFL restricted free agent who had a first-round tender placed on him this year.
He had yet to sign the tender — valued at $4.641 million, per Over the Cap — as of Friday.
“Whether you call him a tight end, receiver, a specialist, a quarterback, he’s going to play.
