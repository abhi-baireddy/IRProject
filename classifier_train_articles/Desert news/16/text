Disney will release “Artemis Fowl” exclusively on its streaming service Disney Plus later this summer, the company announced Thursday night.

“Artemis Fowl” will be released on June 12.

The film is based on the Eoin Colfer novel “Artemis Fowl,” which tells the story of a criminal mastermind and genius who is in a battle of wits with ancient fairies, who may know about Fowl’s missing father.

The film will be “a fantastical epic adventure, resplendent with beautiful landscapes and spectacular visual effects that will transport viewers to magical new worlds,” according to a release from Disney Plus.

Director Kevin Branagh said in a release that family plays a large role in the film.

Branagh said: “Artemis Fowl is a true original. In challenging times, a 12-year-old criminal mastermind is one heck of a traveling companion. Smart, funny, and cool as mustard, he’ll take you to new worlds, meet unforgettable characters and mix magic with mayhem. His own family is everything to him, and (although he’d never admit it), he’d be as proud as I am that families around the world will now be able to enjoy his first amazing screen adventures together, on Disney Plus.”

The film stars Ferdia Shaw, Lara McDonnell, Josh Gad, Tamara Smart, Nonso Anozie, Josh McGuire, Nikesh Patel and Adrian Scarborough, with Colin Farrell and Judi Dench.
