“My name is David, and I am an otherwise healthy 27-year-old male with no past medical history.
I am a fourth-year medical student, who will soon be a doctor starting residency in June.
I thought I was INVINCIBLE—I thought I was immune to this coronavirus because I am healthy and young.
But I was wrong.”So begins his message, posted on a Student Life blog hosted by Indiana University School of Medicine, where he is enrolled.
Deseret News staff writer Ethan Bauer has begun chronicling “People of the Pandemic,” but not necessarily those like David the medical student, who have become ill. Basically anyone else.
