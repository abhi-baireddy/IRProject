The Disney Parks app recently shared the recipe for how to make the Dole Whip pineapple treat.

What’s happened:

The Disneyland app sent a notification Wednesday afternoon with the recipe for how to create a “frozen pineapple treat,” or the Dole Whip snack, through its app.

The recipe was delivered through small slides that users swiped through.

The recipe (for a single serving) reads at the following:

1 big scoop of ice cream

4 oz of pineapple juice

2 cups of frozen pineapple

Add all ingredients to a blender until it’s a thick drink.

Add your swirl and then you’re done.

Just a note: The original Dole Whip is dairy-free, so you’ll want to use dairy-free ice cream if you want to make the real option. You can check out Dole’s official recipe or see Dole’s official soft serve mix for more information.

Earlier this week, Disney shared the official recipe for the churros you’ll find at the park, too, as reported by the Deseret News. The company has been sharing these recipes as its parks remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
