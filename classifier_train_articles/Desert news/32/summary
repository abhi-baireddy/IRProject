The Disney Parks app recently shared the recipe for how to make the Dole Whip pineapple treat.
What’s happened:The Disneyland app sent a notification Wednesday afternoon with the recipe for how to create a “frozen pineapple treat,” or the Dole Whip snack, through its app.
Just a note: The original Dole Whip is dairy-free, so you’ll want to use dairy-free ice cream if you want to make the real option.
You can check out Dole’s official recipe or see Dole’s official soft serve mix for more information.
Here’s a look at the recipe slides, courtesy of Disney:Earlier this week, Disney shared the official recipe for the churros you’ll find at the park, too, as reported by the Deseret News.
