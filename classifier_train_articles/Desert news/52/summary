SALT LAKE CITY — In the month since the NBA was suspended after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus on March 11, drama has swirled over the notion that he and teammate Donovan Mitchell are at odds with each other.
That drama came to an apex on Friday when The Athletic published a story indicating the relationship between Utah Jazz franchise cornerstones Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell “doesn’t appear salvageable” after Mitchell tested positive later that night.
On Sunday night, Gobert went on Instagram Live Sunday evening and shared his thoughts on the subject.
We’re both grown men and gonna do what it takes to win.”Prior to speaking with Ricks, Gobert spoke with Blackson.
“It’s all about how you handle it,” Gobert said, noting there was a strain on his and Mitchell’s relationship.
