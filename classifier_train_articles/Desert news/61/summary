Neither of us originally planned to run for governor or lieutenant governor.
We were well on the way to getting the needed signatures when the governor told everyone to stay home.
Our governor and lieutenant governor have refused to do this.
Jan Garbett is a Utah businesswoman, mother of 8, and a Republican candidate for governor of Utah.
He is Janâ€™s running mate for lieutenant governor.
