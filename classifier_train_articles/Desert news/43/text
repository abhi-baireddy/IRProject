After finishing 16-15 last season and losing in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament to Oregon State, Utah basketball figures to be improved next season. So far, its core looks to be coming back and the Utes will add a top-30 national recruiting class, the second-best in the Pac-12.

College basketball expert Jon Rothstein sees the Utes as one of the most improved teams in the country next season, according to a video for Yahoo Sports.

“Larry Krystkowiak had moments last year at Utah where it looked like the Utes had a chance to be one of the more relevant teams in the Pac-12. The nucleus of Rylan Jones, Both Gach and Timmy Allen, all back for another season. Larry Krystkowiak obviously a very proven coach. We’ve seen programs put teams together year by year, Utah has real continuity right now. The Utes to me look like a top 6 or 7 team in the Pac-12 next season. That means they’re good enough to compete for a berth in the 2021 NCAA Tournament,” Rothstein said.
