After finishing 16-15 last season and losing in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament to Oregon State, Utah basketball figures to be improved next season.
So far, its core looks to be coming back and the Utes will add a top-30 national recruiting class, the second-best in the Pac-12.
College basketball expert Jon Rothstein sees the Utes as one of the most improved teams in the country next season, according to a video for Yahoo Sports.
The Utes to me look like a top 6 or 7 team in the Pac-12 next season.
That means they’re good enough to compete for a berth in the 2021 NCAA Tournament,” Rothstein said.
