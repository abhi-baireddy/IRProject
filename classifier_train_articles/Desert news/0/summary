SALT LAKE CITY — Until it was mentioned to her, Utah Royals FC outside back Katie Bowen had forgotten her team was supposed to kick off its 2020 season Saturday night on the road against Portland Thorns FC.
“There’s some good days and there’s some pretty bad days where people are missing home, they’re missing their families.
“I think we go through those waves of homesickness, but we’ve got our roommates to lean on,” she said.
Vincent said rather than dwell on what was supposed to be this weekend, players are trying to focus on what they can control, even though they wish circumstances were different.
“We’re trying to just be present ... taking it one day at a time, but of course, yeah, we’d love to be having our first matches already.”
