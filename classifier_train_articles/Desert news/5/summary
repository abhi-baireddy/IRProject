WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.
After he is released, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home, according to a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the matter.
Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.
Officials said she had last worked at the Atlanta prison on April 10 and appeared to be asymptomatic.
