Commissioner Adam Silver said it remains impossible for the NBA to make any decisions about whether to resume this season and that it is unclear when that will change.
“I think there is a sense that we can continue to take the leading role as we learn more in coming up with an appropriate regimen and protocol for returning to business,” Silver said.
If none of the 259 outstanding regular season games are played, the league’s players would lose about $800 million in gross salary.
“If there is an opportunity to resume play, even if it looks different than what we’ve done historically, we should be modeling it.
But Silver said the league isn’t actively pursuing any such “bubble” plan yet, again citing so much uncertainty in so many areas.
