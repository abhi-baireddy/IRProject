The 48-year-old computer programmer has been a busy man since he launched Neighbors Helping Neighbors in March, a website that pairs elderly or immunocompromised Utahns with nearby volunteers to do their grocery shopping and other errands, free of charge.
About a dozen of his clients have put in requests for groceries, medication or other essential items, only to cancel them when they realize they don’t have enough money.
“I have to tell these people, ‘unfortunately we can’t do anything, we don’t have any funds right now,’” Ha said.
“$50 could’ve covered the cost of the medicine,” said Ha, recalling one case where an elderly client couldn’t afford prescription drugs for her autistic son.
“I would be so happy if my website is no longer needed, that is the goal,” he said.
