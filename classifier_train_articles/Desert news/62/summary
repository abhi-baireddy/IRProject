As of April 15, Utah County has a population just north of 630,000.
About 400 of every 100,000 population are diagnosed with COVID-19, about 30 of every 100,000 population are hospitalized with COVID-19 and about 3 out of every 100,000 population have died of COVID-19There is no rational reason for Utah County not to return to work now.
We know how to self-quarantine and want to be tested with any of even the mildest presenting symptoms.
Testing for COVID-19 should be made available for whomever desires it.
We need our leaders who have confidence in the people of Utah to move ahead safely and responsibly to get this country working again.
