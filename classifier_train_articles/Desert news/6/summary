Last week, Daybell’s team filed court documents for more bail reduction.
However, bail bond company owners told me there hasn’t been talks between Lori Vallow Daybell and those stores.
Danielle Kingston, the owner of A+ Idaho Bail Bonds in Rexburg, Idaho, told me bail bond companies won’t work with clients if they might be a flight risk.
But the lack of family jumping to her aid also presents problems, Kingston told me.
“If you have no family willing to help and no friends willing to help, why would a bail bondsman be willing to help?” Kingston asked.
