The company EDsmart is paying up to five people $1,000 to watch the eight “Harry Potter” films and the two “Fantastic Beasts” films.

The catch? You have to live-tweet the experience.

“Most of the Muggle world is struggling with self-isolation and not having a normal routine — like we’re all living in the cupboard under the stairs,” the company said in a press release. “We realize that at this time, we can’t all head to Diagon Alley to stock up on goods nor Hogwarts to be with our friends.”

The application is open to all U.S. residents over the age of 18. Applicants should be active on social media and have access to a streaming service to watch all the films.

The 10-movie marathon will take just over 25 hours, meaning the payout comes to about $40 an hour. EDsmart will also send the selected applicants a Potter Prize package worth $155 that includes the following:

Harry Potter Butterbeer caramel corn packages

Harry Potter gummy candy slugs

Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans

Chocolate frogs

A “Harry Potter” Gryffindor snuggie

A Hogwarts Alumni stainless steel insulated Tumbler

A $100 Grubhub gift card

Of the five marathoners, the company said the “top pick” will receive the complete “Harry Potter” film collection on Blu-ray.

Applications close on May 15, and the recipients will then be chosen within the next seven days.
