Salt Lake City’s online complaint page is clear.
“Shunning and shaming” is what The Wall Street Journal calls the behavior of many people on social media.
Some cities in California encouraged people to report on each other via social media, the opposite of what Salt Lake City is urging people to do.
Unfortunately, social media tends to forge its own paths independent of what governments may desire.
Complaint pages such as Salt Lake City’s are fine so long as they are followed as intended.
