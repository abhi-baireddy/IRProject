The Utah Jazz traded for Mike Conley last summer with the idea he could be a big part of their NBA championship-winning aspirations.
The league, of course, is on hold right now during the coronavirus pandemic, but Conley, at least, will still be aiming for a title on Thursday.
Minnesota Timberwolves guard Zach LaVine will face Allie Quigley of the WNBA’s Chicago Sky in the other semifinal Thursday night.
In the first round, Conley showed another edge he has: he’s ambidextrous, which comes in handy in HORSE, as a player can specify which hand has to be used to shoot a shot.
Against Catchings, he on multiple occasions called out that a shot needed to be taken with the “off hand,” which meant he shot with his right hand and Catchings her left.
