More than just a hypothetical, though, it is an examination of the arguments for and against a Utah national title win.
Here, the national championship would have come down to a single meet between the Sooners, Gators, Bruins and Red Rocks.
It is exactly that history, though, that suggests that the 2020 Red Rocks could have brought home the chip.
By those numbers, the 2020 Red Rocks just werenâ€™t on the level of a national title contender.
A third-place finish would have represented a significant step forward for the Red Rocks.
