Every year we have a flu season where tens of thousands of people die from complications caused by a virus.
Older people, children and people with other serious illnesses succumb to the complications â€” most often pneumonia.
The information on COVID-19 has been confusing from the very beginning, and leaves one questioning what is true about the virus and the world situation.
Just look to Africa to see the power of government to cause famine.
It is time to face the real dangers of overregulation and loosing our freedom to act sensibly on our own.
