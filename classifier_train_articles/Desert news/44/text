Every year we have a flu season where tens of thousands of people die from complications caused by a virus. The particular virus is seldom the chief cause. Older people, children and people with other serious illnesses succumb to the complications â€” most often pneumonia.

Normally, most of us get immunity by exposure and the next year a new virus appears. The information on COVID-19 has been confusing from the very beginning, and leaves one questioning what is true about the virus and the world situation. There are repeated questions about the best way to combat it.

What is very true is that worldwide economies are suffering and being bankrupted. More importantly, the food industry is in danger of collapse. Dairy is being dumped in unimaginable quantities each day. Farmers are destroying millions of pounds of produce. Food production is slowed. We are moving quickly towards a government-caused famine. Just look to Africa to see the power of government to cause famine. It is time to face the real dangers of overregulation and loosing our freedom to act sensibly on our own.
