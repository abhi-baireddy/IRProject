If the new pathogen is not kept in check, it has the potential to overwhelm our health care systems, as well.
As leaders of our state and leaders of our health systems, we are obligated to keep our health care workforce healthy so that they can keep Utah citizens healthy.
Our health systems are prepared with procedures in place to help slow the virus spread as patients are tested and treated.
