Regardless of when the season resumes, and how many games are played, there are big questions about how realistic it is to have fans attend matches.
With the suspension continuing until at least June 8, thatâ€™s a total of 15 scheduled games RSL has lost so far.
From June 8 until the scheduled end of the season on Oct. 4, Real Salt Lake only has one scheduled midweek game.
By adding more midweek games and extending the regular season perhaps another month, some of those games can be made up but not all of them.
Juarez said an abbreviated schedule that includes home and away games with all the Western Conference teams might be a viable solution going forward.
