Two Utah Jazz players have now tested positive for COVID-19.
All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell has tested positive for the coronavirus after it was announced that teammate Rudy Gobert had tested positive Wednesday, bringing the NBA season to a halt.
Jazz players privately say that Rudy Gobert had been careless in the locker room touching other players and their belongings.
Sources: Donovan Mitchell was the only Jazz player/personnel to test positive for coronavirus out of 58 tests administered on Wednesday night.
“Thanks to everyone who has been reaching out since hearing the news about my positive test,” he wrote.
