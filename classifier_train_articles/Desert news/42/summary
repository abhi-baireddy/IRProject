The Killers have just been invited to perform in the “One World: Together at Home” broadcast, the band announced on Twitter.
We accepted and it will conflict with our planned Instagram Live Q&A, so would you mind if we moved the Live Q&A to next Friday at 12 PST?
The Killers’ participation in “One World: Together at Home” means the band is pushing back its live Instagram concert and Q&A originally scheduled for this afternoon at 1 p.m. MT.
“The news is changing every hour around coronavirus,” the Killers tweeted on March 16.
“We are taking this personally,” the Killers tweeted.
