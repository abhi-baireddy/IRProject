It is time for it to end — and politicians can no longer simply shrug their shoulders and blame it on someone else.
It is the story about four American citizens named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody.
Somebody got angry because, really, it was Everybody’s responsibility, yet Everybody thought Somebody would do it.
When the problem became a true crisis, Somebody blamed Anybody and Everybody for the problem.
We should remember that the only reason we can stand on their shoulders is because they were willing to square them.
