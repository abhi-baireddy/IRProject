SALT LAKE CITY — How do you get your Utah gymnastics fix?
For the vast majority of fans, though, there is one major means by which they connect with Utah gymnastics — over social media.
All told, more than 132,000 people follow Utah gymnastics on various social media platforms and that estimate is most likely underselling things.
There is for the most part a single person ultimately responsible for crafting all the content consumed over Utah gymnastics’ social media platforms, who influences how tens of thousands perceive the Red Rocks — Misty-Jade Carlson.
Key to all the content she pumped out this season was her interaction with the Red Rocks themselves.
