SALT LAKE CITY — Utah reported two more COVID-19 deaths Saturday and more than 100 new confirmed cases.

The latest fatalities include a Utah County woman and a Salt Lake County man, both described only as older than 60, according to the Utah Department of Health. The woman died in a hospital.

Officials did not know whether either of the victims had underlying medical conditions. They bring the state’s death toll to 25.

Confirmed cases of the disease now stand at 2,931 in the Beehive State, a rise of nearly 130 since Friday.

Testing results

Just under 60,000 people have been tested as of Saturday, more than 4,000 since the previous day. The positive rate hovers just below 5%.

Some have expressed concern about delays of up to 72 hours while awaiting test results after Utah expanded its testing criteria to include anyone with one or more symptoms including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell and muscle aches.

While most labs return results in 24 to 48 hours, results could be delayed for up to 72 hours depending on the time of day a person gets tested and when a site sends its testing samples into a lab, said Tom Hudachko, Utah Health Department spokesman.

Those who test positive usually receive their results sooner than those who test negative, according to health officials.

Despite expanding the criteria, Hudachko says the state is still seeing demand below capacity for testing. Utah can perform up to 5,000 tests per day.

A map showing testing site locations is available on the health department’s website, coronavirus.utah.gov/utah-covid-19-testing-locations.

Updated demographics

The health department has also released more extensive data on hospitalizations and demographics of those who have tested positive in the state.

COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by age:

1 year old and younger, 16, or 1% of total cases; 0 hospitalizations.

1-14, 69 cases, or 2% of total cases; 1 hospitalization.

15-24, 422 cases, or 14% of total cases; 9 hospitalizations.

25-44, 1,173 cases, or 40%; 63 hospitalizations.

45-64, 936 cases, or 32%; 105 hospitalizations.

65-84, 282 cases, or 10%; 63 hospitalizations.

85 and older, 28, or 1%; 10 hospitalizations.

The data shows the largest number of cases in those in the 45-64 age group, followed by those between the ages of 15 and 24. But hospitalization rates drastically rise in older adults, with 35.7% of those ages 85 and older, and 22.3% of those 65 to 84 who test positive for the virus requiring hospitalization.

Of the 2,931 people who have tested positive, at least 251 have required hospitalization — an 8.8% rate.

State health officials this week reported those in the Latino and Hispanic communities have been disproportionately affected by the disease, accounting for 28% of the positive cases while they make up 14% of Utah’s population.

The updated data shows 29.9% of the cases have been Latino or Hispanic, with 877 people testing positive.

Meanwhile, 51.8% of those who tested positive are white, 2.9% are Asian, 1.8% are black, 1.7% are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 1% are Native Indian or Alaska Native, according to Utah Health Department data.

About 18% of cases are listed as either other or unknown race.

The confirmed cases are divided nearly equally by sex, except for in the 25-44 and 45-64 age groups, in which men outnumber women.

Five hundred and sixty-five Utahns who tested positive for the virus at least three weeks ago are considered recovered.
