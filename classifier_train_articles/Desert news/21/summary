SALT LAKE CITY — When it comes to Tyler Huntley, Utah offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig doesn’t mince any words.
“The guy is going to be an excellent pro,” Ludwig said.
Ludwig has spoken with a couple of NFL coaches about Huntley and speaks highly of him.
Ludwig said Huntley isn’t discouraged by the combine slight and his spirits are high as the NFL draft approaches.
“Huntley already has all of the traits that make a quarterback successful in the NFL,” wrote SI.com’s Ryan Kostecka.
