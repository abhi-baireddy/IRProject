Former “The Office” star John Krasinski will be hosting a “virtual prom” as part of his new YouTube show, “Some Good News,” according to CNN.

While schools remain closed across the country and students miss out on traditional events like prom and graduation, Krasinski decided to host a prom online, CNN reported.

“One of our favorite segments on @somegoodnews is ‘What’d I miss?’ And I just can’t take it anymore how much all you guys are missing prom,” Krasinski wrote on Twitter. “So let’s do something about it!”

Krasinski will DJ the event “with some friends” on YouTube, he wrote on Twitter.

The virtual prom is not the only way that Krasinski has tried to help out during the coronavirus pandemic. He previously invited Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of “Hamilton” onto “Some Good News” to perform live via Zoom for a young girl who would be missing out on her “Hamilton” due to the pandemic, according to the Deseret News.

Krasinski also teamed up with Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz to give Red Sox tickets for life to Boston medical workers, the Deseret News reported.

The “SGN Prom” will take place April 17 at 8 p.m. EST/5 p.m. PST.
