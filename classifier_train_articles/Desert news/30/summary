The church posted an additional document with questions and answers specific to the COVID-19 pandemic on its Church Newsroom website.
Church leaders suspended all gatherings for worship services more than five weeks ago, since March 12.
Patriarchal blessings are suspended, but if local pandemic regulations allow, they should be provided to new missionaries.
Weddings should not be held in church meetinghouses unless government regulations permit, the church leaders said.
Local church leaders with additional questions are asked to consult with their area presidency.
