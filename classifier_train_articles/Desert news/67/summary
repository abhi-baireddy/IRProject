Governments and media have hyped the number of new COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths of those who tested positive for the virus prior to death.
The only number that is really informative is the change in the death rate of the population.
Using that baseline, compare the total number of deaths from respiratory issues this year, including COVID-19 deaths.
However, if there is a net increase in deaths, then we need to weigh this increase in determining how to react.
So far we donâ€™t have conclusive numbers that indicate a significant change.
