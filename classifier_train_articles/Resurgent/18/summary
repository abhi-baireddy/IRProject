It is odd to think, therefore, that a century and a half later, slavery would still be around in America.
In 2018 alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline handled 10,949 cases that resulted in the identification of 23,078 human trafficking survivors in the United Statesâ€”a 25% increase in cases over the course of one year.
Furthermore, although the majority of trafficking victims in the U.S. are Americans, many foreign nationals also fall into the hands of traffickers.
Recent migration/relocation, in fact, was identified as the top risk factor for human trafficking in 2018 by National Human Trafficking Hotline.
Even if these migrants make it safely to the U.S., they can become trafficking victims once they are here.
