Thatâ€™s why the Texas Public Policy Foundation has proposed a Workforce Recovery Act to restore confidence in the American economy at all levels.
The act would implement a national business-interruption insurance plan that can help solve the crisis that has already cost millions of American jobs.
The Workforce Recovery Act would pair the resources of the federal government with the expertise and vast claims processing functions of the insurance industry.
In short, the Workplace Recovery Act will be aimed at business continuity and employee retention.
The American economy runs on confidence, and the Workplace Recovery Act could help to restore that confidence at every level.
