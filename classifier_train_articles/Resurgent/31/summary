She indeed suffers from multiple mental illnesses as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders.
All of the information about Greta’s mental health diagnoses has been in the public realm for some time.
I first became aware of Greta when I was researching the climate movement following the protest by children in Senator Feinstein’s office.
In February, I questioned the adults in Greta’s life thrusting her into the public eye based on the information I found at the time.
What descriptor would have been politically correct enough to describe her as a child who suffers from multiple mental health diagnoses?
