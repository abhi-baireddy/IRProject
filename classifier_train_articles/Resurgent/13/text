President Trump has, for four years, defied the herd and expert opinion on so much. They told him not to move the embassy to Jerusalem. He did. They told him not to end the deal with Iran. He did. They told him not to get out of the Paris Accord. He did. They told him not to shut down the government. He did. They told him not to deal directly with North Korea. He did.

On and on it goes — this President has spectacularly and repeatedly defied conventional wisdom. He has chosen to ignore experts even when others predicted it could cost lives.

But now, in this case, the President has advocated shelter-in-place. He has advocated shutting down the country to keep the virus from spreading. He has listened to the experts.

I’m genuinely curious why. So many of his supporters vehemently disagree with shelter-in-place, but they do not blame the President. They blame the experts.

The President has a history of ignoring the experts. But he is listening to these experts. I just don’t understand what makes this different in the eyes of his core supporters.

From my vantage point, if the President is listening to these experts and doing this, I would suggest this really is a super serious issue and maybe we should give him and the experts the benefit of the doubt. Maybe we really have needed to shut down.

So I am interested in the opinions of those who think this is overblown, particularly from the angle of why is this President who has a history of defying his experts even when lives might be at stake now listening to the experts.
