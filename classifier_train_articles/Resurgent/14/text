I thought maybe this was just a local thing, but it’s not. Since half of my family of four consists of two preteen boys, we go through a lot of frozen pizza. I have noticed in my foraging trips through the Cursed Earth, a definite shortage of the Totinos Party Pizza we normally buy by the half dozen.

But I have learned that this Great Frozen Pizza Shortage is a thing. Frozen pizza sales are up by triple digits, and “every day being like Super Bowl Sunday” is how one executive described it.

“I’ve been in this business over 25 years, [and] I’ve never seen a spike like this across the country,” said Newman’s Own president and COO Dave Best, who reported that sales of his company’s frozen pizzas are up by 190% since the coronavirus crisis began. “This is unprecedented,” he added.

It makes sense, really. When some large percentage of the still-employed workforce is working from home, restaurants are closed, and many people are now laid off and seeking cheap comfort food, frozen pizza is going to be a staple.

Frozen pizza deliveries are now treated like illicit drug transactions.

In the Massachusetts town of Fall River two weeks ago, one truck driver for Schwan’s, maker of the Red Baron brand, resorted to padlocking his trailer for fear that panicked shoppers would break in.

And the economics of scarcity is starting to take hold: Walmart is charging double what it charged just a month ago for a Red Baron pepperoni pizza.

Those who argue that we will be locked down for another two or three months really need to consider these effects. When they do, they’ll realize that a social disruption of this magnitude (not just pizza, but everything) can’t last, and people will willingly walk out and risk the virus to get the thing they value most at that moment.

Frozen pizza, among other things, is the canary in the coal mine that this lock-down’s days are numbered.
