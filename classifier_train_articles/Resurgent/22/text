By now, we’re all familiar with the Waffle House Index. It’s an actual measure that meteorologists and other agencies use to determine the extent of a natural disaster or other incident based on how many locations of the iconic 24-hour restaurant chain close.

For those of you who don’t understand: Waffle House is a glorious Southern institution that has spread to some areas outside the South. The restaurant chain serves delicious food 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and never closes unless there’s an emergency.

If anyone is using the Waffle House Index to measure the coronavirus crisis, it may not quite be time to panic – depending on where you live. The chain has closed 365 units as of yesterday in areas where the virus has hit particularly hard.

Before you go smashing windows of your nearest Waffle House location, don’t worry. You can still order an All-Star or get your hash browns scattered, smothered, and covered at one of the over 1,600 Waffle Houses that are still open.

Last week, Waffle House wrote another post addressing how they’re looking to take care of their employees as well as their customers:

“We want to acknowledge the great efforts of our associates, who work hard every shift to create a safe, warm and welcoming dining experience 24 hours daily.”

The post continued, saying, “We are working hard to support them as we do our best to manage through this crisis.”

It’s nice to see that some things never change. Waffle House is known for quality comfort food and friendly service that’s always around whenever you need it. Even in a time of sheltering in place, it’s truly comforting to know that you can partake in Burt’s chili with the proper social distancing.

Here’s to the amazing folks at Waffle House who are keeping the world going in a time of crisis. Pray for them, and support Waffle House when you can.
