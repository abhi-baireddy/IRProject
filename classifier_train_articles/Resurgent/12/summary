The report said that Fox News had requested to see the evidence but so far had not been provided access.
The theory presented by the sources is that researchers at the Wuhan lab were attempting to demonstrate that China was as competent as the US in identifying and fighting viruses.
The sources believe that the virus occurred naturally and that a researcher in the lab became patient zero.
The virus then started spreading from human to human in the outside community after the researcher left the lab.
Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported on leaked State Department messages that warned about safety and managerial issues at the Wuhan lab.
