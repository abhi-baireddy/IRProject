Would I ever think of pro wrestling as an essential business in the days of coronavirus?
We’re seeing plenty of differing opinions on what constitutes essential business under our new paradigm.
For example, in Florida, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wasn’t initially an essential business under Governor Ron DeSantis’ quarantine order on April 1, but apparently that has changed and the WWE will continue taping matches without audiences.
“I think initially there was a review that was done and they were not initially deemed an essential business.
With some conversation with the governor’s office regarding the governor’s [stay-at-home] order, they were deemed an essential business,” Demings said.
