I want to make our response to this so overwhelming that China will change its behavior.
I want to get the medical supply chain back into the United States.
I want to stop canceling some debt that we owe to China because they should be paying us, not us paying China.
But regardless of whether this benefits Democrats or Republicans domestically, I am begging Americans of all political stripes to agree with Senator Graham.
China must pay, and must pay dearly for what they have done.
