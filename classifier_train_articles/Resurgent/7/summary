On Thursday night, the Trump Administration announced new guidelines designed to open up the United States economy.
The guidelines were formally announced following a phone call between President Trump and the nation’s governors, wherein the president made it clear that the governors were to take charge.
Two points stick out from the Trump Administration’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines and their chance for success.
Not the best news for those looking to open America back up this very instant.
Despite this, “Opening Up America Again” shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
