It’s a fascinating case study into some of our rigid political dogma unfolding in real time.
Kraft reportedly personally purchased 300,000 masks which he planned to give to New York Gov.
A large number of business executives, including billionaires and millionaires, have donated generously to combat the virus and work towards its cure.
But it’s also, as I mentioned, a good case study for our future political discussions.
Every election cycle we are treated to the socialist claptrap of railing against billionaires and millionaires.
