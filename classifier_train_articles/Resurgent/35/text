Not a joke.

During the month of March, more Americans bought handguns and underwent background checks in record numbers—especially in wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Instant Criminal (NICS) Background Check System‘s latest numbers 3,740,688 background checks were processed last month—up from 2,802,467 in February. Since January 1st, over nine million background checks have been processed.

Prospective gun buyers must submit themselves to the National Instant Criminal (NICS) Background Check System, which has been active since 1998.

Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, a leading authority on compiling gun sale stats, issued a press release today noting 2,583,328 handguns were sold last month—an 86% increase from March 2019 gun sales. Their methodology for procuring gun sale stats is largely taken from FBI’s NICS System adjusted for checks unrelated to “end-user firearms sales.”

More Americans are buying firearms to protect themselves in these uncertain times. Over the weekend, I wrote about DHS and CISA including firearms manufacturers and ammunition companies as “Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce” businesses.
