The annual Firearm and Ammunition Industry Economic Impact Report, published annually by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), shows a 213% growth in the industry’s economic impact since 2008.
Every year, the report examines “the economic impact the firearm and ammunition industry has” nationally and in all 50 states.
On a year-over-year basis, the industry’s economic impact rose from $52 in 2018 to $60 billion.
The broader impact of the industry flows throughout the economy and supports and generates business for firms seemingly unrelated to firearms at a time when every job in America counts.
“Our industry continues to show the steady and reliable growth that is a hallmark of a healthy industry,” said Joe Bartozzi, NSSF President and CEO.
