The annual Firearm and Ammunition Industry Economic Impact Report, published annually by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), shows a 213% growth in the industry’s economic impact since 2008.

Every year, the report examines “the economic impact the firearm and ammunition industry has” nationally and in all 50 states.

During this period, the total economic impact grew from $19.1 billion in 2008 to $60 billion in 2019, as the number of “full-time-equivalent jobs rose from approximately 166,000 to over 332,000, a 100-percent increase in that period.”

Page 3 of the report breaks down the economic impact numbers:

Page 6 of the report detailed top ten states that supplied the greatest economic output, jobs, and excise taxes across the three categories:

The new report also detailed the noticeable growth in economic impact between the 2018-2019 period.

On a year-over-year basis, the industry’s economic impact rose from $52 in 2018 to $60 billion. Total jobs increased by 20,000 in the same period, from nearly 312,000 to over 332,000. The broader impact of the industry flows throughout the economy and supports and generates business for firms seemingly unrelated to firearms at a time when every job in America counts. These are real people, with real jobs, working in industries as varied as banking, retail, accounting, metalworking and printing, among others.



The announcement also noted the industry paid a whopping $6.74 billion in taxes.

“Our industry continues to show the steady and reliable growth that is a hallmark of a healthy industry,” said Joe Bartozzi, NSSF President and CEO.

He added, “The workers who comprise our ranks are the fabric of our communities. They produce the highest quality firearms and ammunition that millions of law-abiding Americans rely upon to exercise their fundamental right to keep and bear arms and safely enjoy the recreational shooting sports. This growth translates to more jobs that add to our local economies, averaging $55,200 in wages and benefits. In addition, since 2008 we increased federal tax payments by 162 percent, Pittman-Robertson excise taxes that support wildlife conservation by 79 percent and state business taxes by 116 percent.”

As more Americans purchase guns, this impact will be felt and continue to not go unnoticed by the public.
