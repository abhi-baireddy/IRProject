The destructive folly of transgender politics has even reached girls’ high school and college athletics.
With his signature, Governor Brad Little made Idaho the first state in the nation to enact the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which seeks to save the spirit of Title IX by preserving athletic opportunities for girls.
Ask any student-athlete, high school coach, or parent—allowing biological men to perform in girls’ sports unfairly puts biological girls at a competitive disadvantage.
The Fairness in Women’s Sports Act restores common sense and basic fairness to school athletics.
Other states need to follow the example of Idaho if we are to save sports for generations of girls to come.
