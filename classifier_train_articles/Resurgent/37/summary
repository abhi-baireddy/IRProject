I didnâ€™t sit down and watch the LGBTQ Town Hall on CNN last night.
It was the same for the Climate Town Hall.
The town halls have been on topics the DNC chose not to focus a formal debate on.
The Climate Town Hall was a veritable cornucopia of future campaign commercials.
The climate change debacle basically showed voters the Democrats are willing to destroy the economy to fight Mother Nature.
