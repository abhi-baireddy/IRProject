Throw in the minor league teams – there are 156 official farm teams in the US – and the numbers explode to nearly 10,000 tests per week.
And the American minor league teams are barely half of the whole farm system used by the MLB.
Teams in Canada, Mexico and the Dominican Republic (renowned factory of shortstops) make up at least another 105 teams, resulting in another 5,250 weekly tests under Fauci’s recommendation.
Add in the NBA, NHL, PGA and NASCAR (and their feeder leagues) and we could easily be looking at 50,000 weekly tests.
Recurring weekly tests though, may be too aggressive.
