I am a husband, father of three, Green Beret combat veteran, and for the past five years have served in the Virginia House of Delegates as a conservative Republican.
Prior to becoming a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, you were a Green Beret.
I believe that the Republican Party has strong roots in protecting liberty and my goal is to ensure that it remains committed to those principles.
Could you talk about Virginia politically at-large and what your thoughts on the current status of the Republican Party of Virginia are?
The Republican Party of Virginia has to get back to the basics of supporting local units and activists.
