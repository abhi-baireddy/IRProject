Americans haven’t been doing well under stay at home (SAH) orders.
While every state and city have approached SAH orders differently, John Daniel Davidson’s April 13th article aptly noted that “The Corornavirus is Exposing Little Tyrants All Over the Country”.
Governor Whitmer put into effect one of the country’s most restrictive SAH orders.
And the residents of Michigan, conservatives especially, aren’t taking Whitmer’s order restricting their rights.
Her measures are so draconian that four sheriffs in the northern part of Michigan have gone on record saying that won’t enforce her order.
