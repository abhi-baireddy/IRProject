Like COVID-19, the pandemic currently sweeping across the globe, SARS was a coronavirus.
And like COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS originally came from animals.
Some 60 percent of the new diseases that crop up around the globe each year are zoonotic, meaning they come from domesticated animals or wildlife.
SARS originated in bats, likely by way of the mongooselike civet cat.
Itâ€™s too early to say exactly where COVID-19 began, but it likely traveled from bats to scaly anteaters called pangolins to humans.
