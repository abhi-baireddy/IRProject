JIM WATSON/Getty ImagesThe wife of one of Donald Trump’s sons and the girlfriend of another one are each receiving $180,000 a year from the president’s reelection campaign.
Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, and Lara Trump, Eric Trump’s wife, are each receiving $15,000 a month, two GOP sources tell HuffPost.
Campaign manager Bradley Parscale is cutting the checks through his private company rather than the campaign itself.
The fact that the sons’ better halves are getting paid for their work on the reelection campaign isn’t new.
The confrontation described by the Times took place in June of last year, suggesting that the checks for Guilfoyle and Lara Trump are nothing new.
