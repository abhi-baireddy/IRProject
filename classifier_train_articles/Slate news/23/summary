Home testing, drive-up testing, more testing centers.
But we are still not doing enough of the key thing: truly random testing.
Regardless of which type of testing we use, the best information will come from testing a random sample of people.
Iceland did some random population testing recently, which showed about 1 percent of the general population had active infection (half of them asymptomatic).
What can you do, other than tell all your friends that random testing is great?
