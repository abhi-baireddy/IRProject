León Krauze on Los Angeles’ KMEX Univision 34.
I have anchored the evening news for KMEX, Univision’s Spanish-language local station in Los Angeles, for the last eight years.
This form of local news has been particularly relevant during the coronavirus pandemic.
It is up to local news teams like the one I am part of to offer concrete and urgent answers.
Like most local operations across the country, KMEX’s team has had to reinvent the way it broadcasts the news.
