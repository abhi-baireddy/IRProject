Dear How to Do It,I’m a straight, 24-year-old male who has never been able to orgasm.
I have an otherwise healthy sex life and personal habits.
It hasn’t prevented me from developing meaningful romantic connections, but I don’t like having to fake anything or explain why I’m not too vocal.
I don’t think I’m as straight as I used to think.
Keep doing what you’re doing, and don’t focus so much on introducing something novel to your shared sex life during these extraordinary circumstances.
