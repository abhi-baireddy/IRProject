Back when this all started, we were told that we didn’t have to wear masks.
For now, let’s go with: The CDC suggests you can wear a mask, if you want to, and you should wear a mask if you are sick.

There’s one situation in which the answer is a clear, obvious, scientifically agreed-upon yes: If you are sick, wear a mask.
(If you have N95 masks that you would like to donate, the top entry in this Slate guide explains how you can do so.)
