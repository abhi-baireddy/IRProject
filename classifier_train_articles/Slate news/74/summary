You don’t know what happened, and you likely never will.
Had Fling With Girlfriend’s Married Mother: Should I tell my girlfriend that I had a previous fling with her mother?
Re: Disappearing Friend: I disagree you should just write off friends if they don’t contact you for a while.
I once had an old friend go dark on me like that—not returning my calls, etc.
I don’t know if it went any further than accusations, but I know Child Protective Services and the police were involved.
