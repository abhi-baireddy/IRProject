Does a woman know the difference between say a half inch bigger or a whole inch bigger?
Width is far more relevant to me than length, and I’m not the only person who feels that way.
After 43 years, I think you have some reason to believe your wife is happy with your penis, but you’re not alone.
More important, and I’m going way out of my wheelhouse here, you have to manage your stress somehow.
If masturbation isn’t working for you, or you’re getting frustrated trying to be sexual, that’s OK. Everyone has a different stress response.
