At the core of this theory is the idea that New York City is just different.
A cursory look at a map shows that New York City’s coronavirus cases aren’t correlated with neighborhood density at all.
New York City has a lot of restaurants per capita, places where people gather with strangers every night.
The system keeping New York City safe will need to be better than it is elsewhere.
Those are good questions—but we can’t start to answer them before we reassure ourselves, and others, that New York City is not unsafe by design.
