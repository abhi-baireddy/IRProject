Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden in a video message on Tuesday.
After all the noise, Joe Biden just had to hold on to South Carolina to get Democratic voters to effectively nominate him by acclamation.
“You know, I could not be prouder of the incredible progress that we made together during my presidency,” Obama said in a video released Tuesday morning, in which he endorsed Joe Biden.
It’s not a big deal.” But Obama, in his endorsement video, made a similar, if more artful, point.
No, he’s not at the point where he will actually use Trump’s name as the idiot to whom he’s referring.
