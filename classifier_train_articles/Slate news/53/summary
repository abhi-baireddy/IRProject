Is Dove soap actually soap?
In addition to denying that they are soap in the tweet I saw, Dove call its bars “beauty bars,” which does make the fairly convincing argument that they are … not soap.
(Dove’s own head dermatologist once told Bustle, “I truly wish people would stop using soap,” further bolstering this case.)
