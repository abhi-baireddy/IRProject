Q. Prioritizing his friends: I have been with my boyfriend for just over one year, and we have enjoyed a nice relationship.
I no longer feel like a priority to him, and I don’t think I want to prioritize a relationship with someone who is unwilling to limit their contact with others.
I think you’re being unnecessarily hard on yourself!
But if you all end up fighting, I don’t think you should consider that the worst possible outcome or something to be avoided at all costs.
I don’t think she’s suddenly going to become flustered and self-conscious if you bring up herpes suppression.
