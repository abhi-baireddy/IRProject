Mrs. America has zip to spare, bounding along on a ‘70s soundtrack, limning complex history, ideas, alliances, and personal dynamics with assuredness, tact, and insight.
One of the things that Mrs. America makes clear is that great acting is its own kind of sympathy.

But if you’re looking for a hopeful message in Mrs. America, it’s not in Schlafly’s fate.
What makes Mrs. America so painful is also what should make it bearable: One woman can change the world.
