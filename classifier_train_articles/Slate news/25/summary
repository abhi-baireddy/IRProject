A lab scientist works to validate antibody tests of COVID-19 samples from recovered patients in Brooklyn, New York, on Friday.
It’s a question without a real answer, right now, though one promising solution is the idea of antibodies and antibody tests.
Basically, people who have antibodies would get an “immunity passport”—the idea being that because they are known to have the antibodies, the coronavirus won’t make them sick again.
In that way, antibody tests could be an important tool in opening back up the country … or deciding not to.
The problem is that there aren’t that many labs doing it right now because tests that look for novel coronavirus antibodies are taking time to get online.
