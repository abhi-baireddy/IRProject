This week’s mini-episode finds Prudence joined by Toni Golan-Vilella, who helps nonprofits get what they need out of software, and Lizzy Marmon, who secures grants and donor relationships for cultural institutions. Together, they live in Brooklyn.

Prudie, Golan-Vilella, and Marmon discuss a letter writer whose intense social anxiety has her nervous about hanging out with her boyfriend’s friends and whether you should file a police report about a very suspicious job interview that happened decades ago.
