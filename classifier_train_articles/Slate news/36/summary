The Zanimation Studio, I learned, comes from the world of Stikbot toys; its included figurines are Stikbots, or Lego-looking things the size of an adult finger that are adjustable (legs and arms move, head swivels), with “hands” and “feet” that are suction cups.
The studio includes three Stikbots (two humans and a dog), a cardboard green screen, two smaller cardboard prop boxes (slightly larger than a deck of cards), and a mini tripod for a smartphone.
My 8-year-old and I put the green screen together in about 30 seconds, but it took a few minutes to set up the camera, partly because my hefty battery-pack case toppled the tripod.
(The key to using the green screen is making sure it fills the entire frame; any outside light or objects will distort.)
Once we set it up, the studio inspired unprompted teamwork among my boys.
