Your 12-year-old in all likelihood knows exactly what’s going on, and since that’s not a problem because sex is natural, healthy, and good, it’s time to level with her.
Let her know that you know that she knows, and ask her to respect your privacy and to give you more time.
But please don’t yell at her—she’s just curious, and you really shouldn’t want her to associate shame or negativity with sex.
I just don’t know what to do.
You just don’t know where people are coming from and why they do the things you do unless you ask.
