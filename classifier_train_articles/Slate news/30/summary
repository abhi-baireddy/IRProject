Previously worn N95 masks, saved for possible recycling, in the intensive care unit of MedStar St. Mary’s Hospital in Leonardtown, Maryland, on Wednesday.
Here’s the email from David Gifford, vice president, real estate and workplace services:SlateOffering employees these masks is dangerous.
Health care workers need these masks to stay healthy so they can continue to go to work helping people with COVID-19 not die.
In fact Gifford’s email encourages reuse, “for up to two years.” Health care workers are reusing masks because they absolutely need to have them.
Folks with breathing issues should consult a doctor before using N95 masks, a San Francisco Chronicle piece explained a few years ago (they should not be used on children).
