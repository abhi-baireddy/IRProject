I worry that if people put on masks, then they’ll think, OK, I’m protected, and they won’t wash their hands as vigorously or be careful not to touch their faces.
Or worse, they’ll keep touching their faces because they keep adjusting the masks, or they might just start to be lax in their social distancing.
But social distancing is so much more important than the masks.
And provide everything you possibly would need to make this social distancing work.
Knowing that social isolation is the tool, we have to flatten the curve and then take the step of supporting people so they’re able to do that social distancing.
