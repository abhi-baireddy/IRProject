Dear How to Do It,My husband and I have been together for 12 years, married for approximately the last three.
My husband is an alpha gay white male (he’ll be 55 in a few months), very confident (seemingly), vocal, and aggressive.
In my experience, the problem with cheating is often not so much the sex but the lying that facilitates said sex.
Dear How to Do It,I have a fantastic sex life overall.
Dear How to Do It,I can’t decide if I’m asexual or not.
