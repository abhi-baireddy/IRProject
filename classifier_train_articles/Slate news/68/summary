A Navajo woman fills bottles of water at a public tap on June 5 in Thoreau, New Mexico.
This is a routine for Yazzie, 38, one of the 2 million Americans who live without access to running water.
Keeping water stocked in the home she shares with her 10-year-old son, 17-year-old daughter, and 79-year-old mother is a chore on a good day.
Lately, she and her family have been using the water faster than usual as they wash their hands compulsively.
Sometimes, Yazzie drives off the reservation to one of the big-box retailers along the highway to stock up on bottled water.
