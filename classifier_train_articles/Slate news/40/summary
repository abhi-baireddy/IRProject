Q. Interrogated by girlfriend: Iâ€™ve run into a challenging pattern with my girlfriend of three years.
The problem is, when she uses these techniques on me during conflict, it drives me crazy.
I spend the entire conflict justifying and defending why I feel the way I do rather than having her acknowledge any wrongdoing.
Is it reasonable to ask my girlfriend to not utilize her social work techniques in her personal life?
