A company premised on people buying stuff online is now trying to get people to buy less stuff online.
In March, its delivery service shifted its priorities to focus on household goods and medical supplies.
It temporarily halted Fulfilled by Amazon shipments on nonessential items from third-party sellers, though Amazon reversed the ban this week.
The company is also introducing waitlists for its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods home grocery delivery service in an attempt to make the influx of orders more manageable.
Amazon achieved its dominance in the e-commerce sector partly by making online shopping as quick and frictionless as possible.
