Dear Prudence,I’m a biracial (mom is black, dad is white) man, and my girlfriend is white.
Over dinner, my girlfriend began comparing eating vegan to the civil rights movement, which my mom found offensive.
And I don’t think you’re going to be able to keep up this act for much longer.
Dear Prudence,I am a 55-year-old white guy married for over 30 years to a woman I love more every day.
Even if you don’t think they need to be secrets, it doesn’t harm anyone to keep them.
