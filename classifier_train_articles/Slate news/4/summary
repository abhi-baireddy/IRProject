I wish I could recommend The Stone Table to you, but you cannot get it.
Lewis’ Narnia books so good that when I first read it while researching my own Narnia-centric book on childhood reading, I almost gave up in despair.
“I essentially read other books because I could not always be rereading the Narnia books,” Spufford writes.
Second only to my own desire to visit Narnia was my desire for the next best thing: more Narnia books.
That’s what The Stone Table is, an eighth Narnia chronicle, written not as a mere pastiche or parody but with deep and loving fidelity to the original seven.
