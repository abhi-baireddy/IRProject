You say that your husband “constantly thinks” you’re being unfaithful, and you assume his constant monitoring is an involuntary byproduct of his fear and insecurity.
I don’t think therapy will help.
At this point, I’m recognizing that my preferences heavily lean toward stealth and trans men (as opposed to cis men).
Being interested in dating trans men is perfectly fine and morally neutral.
Trans men are not a magically safe or inherently nonharmful group of people; trans men are as capable of cruelty, indifference, abuse, rudeness, and selfishness as anyone else.
