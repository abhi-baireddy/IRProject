Struggling SUNY Downstate Medical Center paid a “restructuring” consultant $34 million to help come up with plans to trim costs — but a stinging audit charged the deal was a bust.
At best, Downstate realized $32 million in savings — or $2 million less than the consultant was paid.
In one case, PMA claimed $4.9 million savings for a reduction in patients’ length-of-stay.
In a response to the draft audit, SUNY chief financial officer Eileen McLoughlin said she “generally agrees” with the recommendations.
Pitts Management CEO David Pitts Tuesday night said he hadn’t seen the audit and declined comment.
