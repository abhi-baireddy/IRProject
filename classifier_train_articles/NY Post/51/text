Actor John Krasinski surprised a little girl with a “Hamilton” reunion on the second episode of his YouTube series “Some Good News” Sunday night.

Original cast members, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Daveed Diggs, Leslie Odom Jr., Renée Elise Goldsberry and Phillipa Soo all joined in via Zoom to perform the song “Alexander Hamilton” from the show — which the girl, Aubrey, was supposed to have seen in Jacksonville, Fla., for her ninth birthday.

Krasinski announced that he and wife Emily Blunt, who also made a guest appearance — turns out Aubrey loves “Mary Poppins,” too — will send the girl to New York to see “Hamilton” instead, once Broadway restrictions lift.

The new episode even included a weather report from Robert De Niro, who drily announced: “It looks, uh, pretty good.”

Some 12 million viewers have watched the first episode of “Some Good News,” which premiered March 29.

The show, filmed from Krasinski and Blunt’s home, features acts of kindness and generosity — like hockey-equipment manufacturer Bauer providing face shields for doctors and nurses, while Fanatics, which normally makes baseball jerseys, has switched to producing masks and hospital gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Krasinski kicked off this week’s show with a generous appreciation of all those who viewed the premiere, in which he interviewed his former “The Office” co-star Steve Carell, thanking everyone for their production notes and teasing fans who had committed “intellectual property heist” by copying his format.
