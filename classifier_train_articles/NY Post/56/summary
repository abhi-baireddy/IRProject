Ahem: Couldn’t Hudson Yards, separated from the Hudson River by only a single block with a sunken rail yard, be threatened, too?
In six short months since the opening, Hudson Yards has become a one-stop-shopping (pun intended) target for every kind of “intersectional” outrage.
Hudson Yards, which brought life, commerce and oodles of free public space to a previously wasted rail yard, makes a fat and easy target for haters of capitalist enterprise and sensible urban renewal.
Never mind that Related has created more truly affordable new units — including some at Hudson Yards — than any other developer in America.
Hudson Yards itself has been praised in nonpolitical circles as a model of sustainable design.
