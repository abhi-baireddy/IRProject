The young nurse accused of killing her co-worker roommate had been ordered to move out by the victim before the murder, the dead woman’s son alleges.
The roommate, Annika Cansino, 23, and her boyfriend, Alexander Alberda, 21, were charged with second-degree murder and kidnapping in the July 18 murder in Thein’s Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, apartment.
“The day before she passed away, I talked with my mom, and she said she would stop sharing an apartment with Annika,” said the son, Zaya Kyaw.
Police say the trio got into an argument on July 18 over the living situation and Thein pushed Cansino.
Thein and Cansino are seen posing with a group, all wearing hospital scrubs except one person — Alberda.
