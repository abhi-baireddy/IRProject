Chris Cuomo’s coronavirus-induced fever may have subsided but the CNN anchor was red hot on Monday.
“I don’t value indulging irrationality, hyper-partisanship.”Cuomo said his battle with COVID-19 has made him rethink his values and question his position as a public figure.
“I don’t think it’s worth it to me because I don’t think I mean enough, I don’t think I matter enough, I don’t think I can really change anything, so then what am I really doing?”“I’m basically being perceived as successful in a system that I don’t value,” he continued.
“I don’t want to do that, I don’t think it’s worth it to me.”
