The coronavirus pandemic has caused schools across the country to close, and while high school students are completing the year from home, seniors are missing out on events such as graduation and prom.

John Krasinski decided he wanted to do something for 2020 seniors stuck inside and announced he will be hosting a virtual prom on his “Some Good News” YouTube channel.

“That’s right class of 2020,” the “Office” actor posted on Instagram. “I’m DJing your prom with some friends this Friday night 8EST/5PST!! Click link in bio for invitation! See you then!”

He posted a throwback photo of himself at his prom, telling his followers he “can’t take it anymore how much you are all missing your prom.”

Krasinski launched “Some Good News” as a way to share positive stories during the uncertain times of the pandemic. On top of sharing stories of generosity, he has also used his show to perform some acts of kindness of his own.

Last week, the actor surprised a little girl with a reunion of the original cast of “Hamilton” performing the song “Alexander Hamilton” over Zoom. He also got health-care workers around the country free AT&T cellphone service and lifetime Red Sox tickets for Boston hospital heroes.

Those who want to virtually attend Krasinski’s prom can visit the “Some Good News” YouTube page to set a reminder and join the fun.
