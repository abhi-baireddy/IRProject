The coronavirus pandemic has caused schools across the country to close, and while high school students are completing the year from home, seniors are missing out on events such as graduation and prom.
John Krasinski decided he wanted to do something for 2020 seniors stuck inside and announced he will be hosting a virtual prom on his “Some Good News” YouTube channel.
“That’s right class of 2020,” the “Office” actor posted on Instagram.
He also got health-care workers around the country free AT&T cellphone service and lifetime Red Sox tickets for Boston hospital heroes.
Those who want to virtually attend Krasinski’s prom can visit the “Some Good News” YouTube page to set a reminder and join the fun.
