Jeff Bezos is adding to his Manhattan real estate empire.
Bezos already owns $80 million worth of real estate in the building.
The properties on those four floors, plus the latest purchase, which is adjacent to the rest, will allow Bezos to create a massive dream home.
The 55-year-old CEO is the wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of more than $125 billion.
Bezos paid around $58 million for it and about $22 million for the two adjacent units on the floor below.
