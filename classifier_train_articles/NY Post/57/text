Jeff Bezos is adding to his Manhattan real estate empire.

The Amazon chief has just bought a $16 million, three-bedroom unit on the 20th floor of 212 Fifth Ave., according to city property records.

Bezos already owns $80 million worth of real estate in the building. Last June, he closed on a three-story penthouse and two apartments on the level right below it.

The properties on those four floors, plus the latest purchase, which is adjacent to the rest, will allow Bezos to create a massive dream home. The 55-year-old CEO is the wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of more than $125 billion.

“I think it is a boost of confidence that the richest man in the world is clearly doubling down on the most important city in the world — even though it is the coronavirus capital,” says top broker Dolly Lenz, who works with her daughter Jenny at Dolly Lenz Real Estate.

Bezos paid “more than market value” for the latest apartment, added Jenny Lenz, “but given that it is uniquely able to be attached to his units, the purchase makes sense.”

The penthouse alone has five bedrooms and 5 ½ bathrooms over 10,079 square feet. It first hit the market in 2017 for $73.8 million. Bezos paid around $58 million for it and about $22 million for the two adjacent units on the floor below.

Building permits were filed on Bezos’s behalf in the fall of 2019 to combine the units, but the work has not yet begun.

A spokesperson for Bezos did not return calls by press time.
