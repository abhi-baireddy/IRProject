More than 1,000 cancer surgeries have been delayed in New York City and other treatments put on hold as hospitals are treating coronavirus cases.
Cuomo’s order last month that hospitals cancel elective surgeries forced cancer centers to determine what could safely be put off.
“Often times it won’t.”At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Upper East Side that meant at least 1,000 surgeries have been postponed as its operating rooms were converted to ICUs for COVID-19 patients.
The hospital treated hundreds of people already under its care who fell ill with the bug as well as staff members, said Dr. Jeffrey Drebin, chairman of surgery.
“We are very confident that no one is dying from cancer because they’re not getting treated,” he said.
