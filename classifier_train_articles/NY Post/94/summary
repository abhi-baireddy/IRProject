The Season 2 opener finds Guillermo, still hoping to become a vampire, threatened by the arrival of Topher (guest star Haley Joel Osment).
“I think Guillermo is protective of Nandor because, after so many years of service to someone, you either learn to love your boss or you wouldn’t be there,” Guillen tells The Post.
Every year that goes by is a second to Nandor but Guillermo hasn’t lived his life to the fullest.
Guillen says he won the role in a very unexpected way — while attending a wine-and-cheese party thrown by a friend.
You should audition for [the role of] Guillermo,” Guillen says.
