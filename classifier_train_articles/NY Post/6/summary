Meet 12 babies...Move over Louis XIV, there’s a new flamboyant royal in town.
In 2015, the presumed heir to the Saudi kingdom Mohammed bin Salman, splashed out almost $300 million on the 50,000 acre Chateau Louis XIV in Louveciennes, near Versailles in France — making it the most expensive home in the world.
Most spectacularly perhaps is the underwater meditation room built inside the castle’s moat, which features a transparent underwater chamber with fish, including sturgeon and koi, swimming above, according to the Sun.
A statue of Louis XIV made of Carrara marble stands watch over the grounds.
“Like in Versailles, that was way over the top too, and like Louis XIV, he achieved something really quite incredible.”
