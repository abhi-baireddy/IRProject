A Russian YouTube star was arrested Sunday for violently assaulting an unsuspecting jogger in Miami Beach, according to a report.
According to TMZ, police later arrested Zdorovetskiy inside a nearby home for felony aggravated battery.
She told police she had never met or seen Zdorovetskiy prior to the attack.
TMZ reports that Zdorovetskiy posted a $7,500 bond on Monday and was released from custody.
In 2016, Los Angeles authorities arrested him for climbing up the letter “D” on the Hollywood sign.
