A Russian YouTube star was arrested Sunday for violently assaulting an unsuspecting jogger in Miami Beach, according to a report.

Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, known for rushing the field at both World Cup and World Series games, as well as a popular zombie prank video in Miami, allegedly jumped out of his car and tackled the woman to the ground, TMZ reported.

He then straddled the woman and allegedly punched her in the chest and face while she screamed for help, according to the report.

The victim claimed several passersby and residents saw the incident, which prompted Zdorovetskiy to run away. According to TMZ, police later arrested Zdorovetskiy inside a nearby home for felony aggravated battery.

The woman was left with a cut that required stitches, along with pain and soreness to her chest.

She told police she had never met or seen Zdorovetskiy prior to the attack.

TMZ reports that Zdorovetskiy posted a $7,500 bond on Monday and was released from custody.

The YouTube prankster has also had several prior run-ins with the law.

In 2016, Los Angeles authorities arrested him for climbing up the letter “D” on the Hollywood sign. He also spent five days in an Egyptian prison after being caught climbing the country’s iconic pyramids.

Zdorovetskiy currently has more than 10 million YouTube subscribers.
