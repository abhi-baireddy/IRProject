Steve Cash, a YouTube performer famous for his “Talking Kitty Cat” video series, has died at 40.

The Nampa Police Department in Idaho responded to a call to his home on Thursday morning and found Cash dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There is no indication of foul play, E! reports.

Cash’s wife, Celia DeCosta Cash, confirmed the news of his death in a Facebook post.

“This is so hard. I’m not even sure what to say, or for that matter, what to do,” she wrote. “I just lost my best friend, my sidekick, my lover, my mentor, my absolute everything, this morning. I’m so sad to say, my husband, Steve Cash took his own life this morning 4/16/2020. It hurts me to share this. Please understand, give the family time to grieve, but know that Steve is no longer in pain.”

Cash, a musician and animal lover, became famous on YouTube nine years ago for videos of him having conversations with his cat Sylvester.

He amassed more than 2.4 million subscribers, with his videos featuring animals talking like humans. They got as many as 17 million views and attracted a cult following online. Merch featured some of his famous catch phrases.

But he was open about his struggles with mental health. Last year, when a fan pointed out that he was more active on social media he responded that he’s “just bipolar. I’m on a manic up right now. When I go back into depression I’ll vacate everything.”

His fan base was left reeling Friday as they found out of his passing.
