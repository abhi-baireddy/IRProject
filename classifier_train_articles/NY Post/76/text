You don’t have to wait until Broadway reopens to get a taste of what’s playing. Beyond the obvious — the movies of “Moulin Rouge!,” “Mean Girls,” “West Side Story” — here are a few things to watch and read to tide you over during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Six”

Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived. In this buzzy new British import, Henry VIII’s six wives compete to see who got the worst of him.

Read it: Historical novelist Philippa Gregory has taken a keen interest in royal wives. Her 2015 book “The Taming of the Queen” imagines what life was like for Catherine (or, as she spells it, Kateryn) Parr who, when she wasn’t holding horny old Henry at bay, tried to save Protestantism while romancing a member of the king’s court.

“Hamilton”

Revolution, the birth of a nation, duels and a side dish of adultery: Lin-Manuel Miranda raps up all that and more in this blockbuster hit.

Screen it: The 1972 movie musical “1776” covers some of the same ground, from wildly different perspectives — in this case, those of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Ken Howard’s Jefferson, by the way, is a helluva lot nicer than his “Hamilton” counterpart.

“The Book of Mormon”

The duo behind “South Park” created this irreverent, profanity laced but ultimately warm-hearted musical about clueless missionaries in Africa.

Screen it: You want irreverent? Try “Monty Python’s The Life of Brian,” about the poor sucker who happened to be born one stable away from Jesus Christ. Confusion ensues, as does a song: “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.”

“Girl From the North Country”

Bob Dylan songs, both beloved and obscure, swirl around this tale of a Midwest boardinghouse and its unlucky denizens during the depths of the Depression.

Screen it: The 1940 film “The Grapes of Wrath” follows the Joad family as they leave their dust-choked Oklahoma farm for the promise of a new life in California. With Henry Fonda in the lead, who can help but feel hopeful?
