Jazz legend Giuseppi Logan died of the coronavirus at a Far Rockaway nursing home, according to a report.
Logan, who became an icon in New York’s free jazz movement in the 1960s, died at the Lawrence Care Center, his friend Matt Lavelle told jazz radio station WBGO.
The trumpeter and clarinetist helped Logan land his first show in decades, a chance to play at the Bowery Poetry Club.
“The Giuseppi Logan Quintet” album was “surprisingly well received,” said Josh Rosenthal, founder of Tompkins Square Records.
“The main thing for me, to be honest, was just to make Giuseppi feel good and to give him some money and some CDs to sell in the park,” Rosenthal told WGBO.
