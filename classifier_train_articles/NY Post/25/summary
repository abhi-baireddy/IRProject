Jing Fong, the city’s largest Chinese restaurant, has closed.
A smaller outpost of the eatery on the Upper West Side will remain open.
“Business there is down 30% to 40% but that is acceptable for now until further notice.
Leo said they hope to re-open at some unknown date in the future.
Maybe when there is a vaccine and a cure but there is no light at the end of this tunnel right now,” Leo said.
