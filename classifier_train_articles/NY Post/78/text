Elizabeth “Liz” Moyano is a nurse and director of quality and performance improvement at St. Mary’s General Hospital in Passaic, New Jersey, fighting coronavirus on the front lines. In her 25 years working as a health care worker, the 47-year-old mother of two has “never experienced anything so devastating,” she tells The Post in our special photography series, “Apart, Together.”

These days, she spends anywhere from 12 to 16 hours at the hospital, monitoring staffing coverage and breaks and assessing what personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed. “Like many hospitals, we are working through many staffing issues and supply issues,” she says.

“We’ve all trained for this, we’ve all planned for this, but the things I’ve personally seen have been difficult to digest,” she says. “‘Normal’ is not a word we can use any more. Every day is just as unpredictable as the next, so I — and we all — do what we need to do.” Here, Moyano takes us through her day as a nurse battling the coronavirus.

The stresses of fighting COVID-19 have not stopped Moyano from pursuing her goals: Each night before bed, she does her homework for her Master of Nursing administration and leadership class. She’s graduating in May.

“I have not stopped to think or attempted to cope with the exhaustion. I think I am running on adrenaline,” she says. “The thing that keeps me going, truly, is seeing all the COVID patients that recover and being discharged home. Every time a vented patient comes off the vent and gets better — that gives me hope that there is another side to all the grief.”
