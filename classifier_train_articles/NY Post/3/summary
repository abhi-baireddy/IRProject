The new dean of the SUNY Downstate College of Medicine has given his students an unexpected anatomy lesson.
Dr. F. Charles Brunicardi posed for photographer Jack Mitchell in 1978 sporting nothing but a full head of curly hair.
The eagle-eyed med students who spotted the photo have given Brunicardi a new nickname — “Dean Dong,” a SUNY Downstate insider said.
The now-balding 65-year-old Brunicardi was named dean in December at the state-run college in Brooklyn and started in late January.
Brunicardi did not respond to requests for comment.
