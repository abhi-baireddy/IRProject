Even the Big Apple’s most beloved Chinese restaurants are in critical condition as the coronavirus keeps customers at bay.
Restaurant owners, the people who work for them and city lawmakers say business at Chinese-owned establishments has plummeted by as much as 60 percent as the global pandemic spreads.
“It’s killed a lot of restaurants and others are just getting by, trying to survive.
“A lot of the large Chinese restaurants in Flushing are now closed — for renovations, they say, but it’s unlikely they’ll reopen,” said Lo.
But Jing Fong — an iconic Chinatown eatery famous for its traditional dim sum carts — is not faring any better than its peers, said Claudia Leo, Jing Fong’s marketing director.
