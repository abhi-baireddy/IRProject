Sinai Beth Israel hospital expansion, Hudson Yards developer Related Companies brought in an army of workmen to make more than 400 new beds available to COVID-19 victims.
Cuomo on March 23 ordered hospitals to double capacity as the death toll mounted and swelling admissions threatened to overwhelm facilities.
They reached out for help to Related CEO Jeff Blau, who’s on the hospital board.
“We redeployed construction execs from Hudson Yards as well as our own contractors.”Thanks to Related’s reinforcements, work that might have taken up to three months longer was completed almost overnight.
Blau said, “Related is about serving our communities and that’s never been more important than it is now.
