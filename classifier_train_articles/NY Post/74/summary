Fiona Shaw’s “Killing Eve” character, MI6 boss Carolyn Martens, has always been mysterious — but that will change in Season 3, premiering 9 p.m. Sunday on BBC America and AMC.
“The audience gets to know Carolyn much more [this season],” Shaw, 61, tells The Post on the phone from her London home.
I think this season does that with everybody.”The Emmy-nominated spy thriller follows the cat and mouse game between assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) and ex-MI6 operative Eve (Sandra Oh).
Season 2 saw Eve and Villanelle working together to take down a common enemy, but it ended on a tense note, with Villanelle shooting Eve and leaving her for dead.
It’s very interesting that she is not frightened of Villanelle, she’s not frightened of Eve.
