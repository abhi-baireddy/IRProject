New York City restaurants cram more humans into tight spaces than anywhere else in the world.
“It’s part of the allure or the charm of New York restaurants that they’re crowded,” says Danny Abrams, owner of Mermaid Inn and downtown’s J.G.
“A restaurant that goes from 150 seats to 75 seats isn’t going to have the same vibe,” says Abrams.
“We have already made floor plans for social-distance dining,” he says — a move that might reduce his restaurants’ 300 seats to 150.
I love the Boqueria tapas restaurants, especially the one near me on Second Avenue at East 76th Street.
