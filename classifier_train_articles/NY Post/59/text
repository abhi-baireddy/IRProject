Flights from Europe’s “open travel zone” will be funneled through JFK, Newark and nine other international airports around the country.

Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that Americans returning from Europe under President Trump’s sweeping travel ban on the continent will undergo screening at around a dozen separate airports and will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.

According to Delta Airlines, those airports include the two New York region airports, as well as Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Honolulu, LAX, Chicago-O’Hare, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington-Dulles.

Details about the screening procedures that Americans and permanent residents coming from the 26 countries included in the restrictions — which begin Friday — are not yet available, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said Thursday.

“At this time, we are working quickly with our partners to operationalize a plan which will outline where these travelers will be routed and what the screening process will be,” said rep Benjamin Haynes.

As of Monday, the agency’s screening process for travelers coming in from Iran, Italy, China or South Korea — countries with widespread outbreaks — included a questionnaire about travel history and symptoms, as well as temperature tests.

Some Americans who flew into Kennedy Airport from Europe on Thursday told The Post there was no stateside screening yet.

Robert Cote, 51, a college professor from Tucson, Arizona, said he cut his trip in the Ukraine short because of the upcoming travel limitation. He said he was pre-screened before boarding in Kyiv.

“In Kyiv, they took our temperatures. They are very strict with their border,” Cote said.

“I thought it would be a little more dramatic [here]. I thought everyone would be taking temperatures.”
