The coronavirus epidemic could be more devastating to the Big Apple’s hotel business than the 1987 stock market crash, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 recession combined, the head of the 40,000-member hotel workers union said Thursday.

“This is worse than all of those put together. 9/11 was insignificant compared to this,” Hotel and Motel Trades Council chief Peter Ward told New York 1 on Thursday. “Hotels never dipped below 60 percent occupied [after Sept. 11] … and that was only for a 20-day period. The effect of 9 /11 on the hotel industry was very brief,” Ward said.

“This,” he added, “is just crushing.”

One of the city’s largest hotels, the 1,878-room Hilton Midtown, has shut down entirely, Ward told the local news network.

Ward projected that as much as 95 percent of the hotel industry’s union staff could be laid off as soon as next week — cuts that will hit waiters, cleaners, engineers, security, lobby clerks and other job types.

“There will be closings and just massive layoffs,” he said, adding that he’s negotiating with hotel management to allow employees to use their paid-time-off to lessen the financial blow and to extend medical coverage for employees.

“They have zero convention business, zero commercial business travelers, and zero tourists,” he said, referring to an occupancy rate of under ten percent. “They simply had to shutter their doors,” he added. “You can’t even pay the electrical bills.”

He said he hopes the hotels can temporarily reopen for alternative use, perhaps serving as sites for COVID-19 patients that would put some employees back to work.

The consequences could be enormous for the city’s bottom line, Ward warned.

“This is the second-largest taxpayer as a business in the City of New York.”
