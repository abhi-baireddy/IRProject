The coronavirus epidemic could be more devastating to the Big Apple’s hotel business than the 1987 stock market crash, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 recession combined, the head of the 40,000-member hotel workers union said Thursday.
9/11 was insignificant compared to this,” Hotel and Motel Trades Council chief Peter Ward told New York 1 on Thursday.
“Hotels never dipped below 60 percent occupied [after Sept. 11] … and that was only for a 20-day period.
“This,” he added, “is just crushing.”One of the city’s largest hotels, the 1,878-room Hilton Midtown, has shut down entirely, Ward told the local news network.
“They have zero convention business, zero commercial business travelers, and zero tourists,” he said, referring to an occupancy rate of under ten percent.
