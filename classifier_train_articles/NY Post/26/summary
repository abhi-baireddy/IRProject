The third installment of “Some Good News” on YouTube found host John Krasinski paying special tribute Sunday to health-care heroes around the US by getting them free cellphone service — and, for some Boston hospital workers, Red Sox tickets for life.
Red Sox players, Boston mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker cheered them on from the Jumbotrons.
Those who didn’t get to make it to Fenway weren’t left out: Krasinski announced that he had asked AT&T to give every nurse and doctor in America free cellphone service for a month, and the company offered to provide three months gratis.
Also on the show, Fox sportscaster Joe Buck lended commentary for videos of people loading their washing machines and emptying dishwashers, and Krasinski played uplifting clips of hospital workers doing conga lines and improvising dances whenever patients came off ventilators.
He is also inspiring imitators: “Walking Dead” star Jeffrey Dean Morgan will debut his own series, “At Home With the Morgans,” Friday night on AMC.
