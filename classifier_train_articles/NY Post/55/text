Toronto’s return to Hogwarts has been postponed for the time being.

The Canadian production of J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which was slated to open on Oct. 23 at the Ed Mirvish Theatre, has been pushed back to 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Exact dates have yet to be announced.

“We understand that this is disappointing, but this delay will help ensure our ability to deliver this spectacular production to audiences safely and successfully and with the launch that our fans deserve,” says producer David Mirvish.

“We are closely monitoring the continuously evolving coronavirus situation and the orders and recommendations made by Public Health Ontario and Toronto Public Health, as well as the recommendations made by officials in the cities and countries where much of the magic of ‘Cursed Child’ is made.”

The Tony and Olivier Award-winning production, along with countless other shows, has been halted in several countries as the pandemic has shuttered theaters across the globe.

The all-Canadian cast, which was recently announced, includes Trevor White as the adult Harry Potter, Gregory Prest as Ron Weasley and Sarah Afful as Hermione Granger.
