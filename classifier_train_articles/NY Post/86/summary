Talk show hosts have experimented doing their gigs with laptops, while news anchors have broadcast from their basements, family rooms and libraries.
“Walking Dead” star Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who plays the ominous Negan on the AMC zombie apocalypse drama, went into his garage and built a studio that looks like his living room.
The premiere episode of his series, “Friday Nights In With the Morgans,” debuts Friday (10 p.m.) on AMC.
He was partly inspired by the “Talking Dead” spinoff and sent a rough outline to AMC president Sarah Burnett.
“I would love to do an episode, a day in the life of Mischief Farm,’ and get cameras outside our studio,” Morgan says.
