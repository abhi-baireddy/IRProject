We see Lois at a rally before the war protesting the Blackshirts, as the British Fascist Party was called, in Episode 1.
Her father, after what heâ€™s gone through in World War I, is opposed to any confrontation.
He wants to do anything to prevent World War II.
The elephant in the room is when this boy [Jan] shows up, and Harry and Lois are going to see eqdh other again.
Lois is going to be a bit confused by this small child Harry brought home as a souvenir.
