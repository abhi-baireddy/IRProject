In fact, it’s a retro throwback to more innocent, cellphone-free days: Water-cooler TV is back.
The series finale of “Modern Family,” after 11 seasons, was watched by 7.4 million people on April 8 — the sitcom’s highest ratings in three years.
Netflix’s current number one show is “Tiger King” — a trashy but fascinating documentary featuring big cat collector (and felon) Joe Exotic and his nemesis, big cat rescue queen Carole Baskin.
The doc’s wacky subjects and irresistibly layered narrative has turned “Tiger King” into America’s great escape — a unifying obsession without any of the tribal contentiousness of sports and politics.
“It is also giving them an opportunity to consume all this other stuff where ‘Tiger King’ is being talked about.”The same goes for fictional dramas.
