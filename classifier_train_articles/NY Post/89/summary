It was no easy task creating the creepy half-organic/half-mechanized aliens in “War of the Worlds,” which wraps its first season Sunday at 9 p.m. on Epix.
“It’s something that hadn’t really been tried before, something that’s very much a robot but has physical, organic elements as well,” Bullock says.
Most of the series’ action unfolds in France and in the UK with diverging plotlines leading into Sunday’s season finale.
“While [‘War of the Worlds’] was being developed, an episode of [the Channel 4/Netflix series] ‘Black Mirror’ came out called ‘Metalheads’ that included [a robot] inspired by Boston Dynamics,” Bullock says.
“There were changes so the creatures could be animated better … to establish the aesthetic, the concept-art side of the series.”
