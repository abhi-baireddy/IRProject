Cuomo should temporarily shut down the NYC subways to help slam the brakes on the coronavirus outbreak, urge four City Council members.
“We believe that drastic measures must be taken to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our transit system,” the lawmakers — Robert Holden, Eric Ulrich, Mark Gonaj and Peter Koo — say in a letter to Cuomo.
With MTA workers still lacking protective gear, trains packed with passengers due to reduced service, and homeless people camping in the cars, the subways are fueling the crisis, the councilmen say.
“As a result, MTA workers are dying at a faster rate than any other front-line workers.”COVID-19 has killed 68 employees to date, spokeswoman Abbey Collins said Saturday.
The private taxi industry doesn’t have the same capacity as the biggest transit system in North America does.
