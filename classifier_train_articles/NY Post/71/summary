What the world needs now is some good news, says John Krasinski.
And, to the delight of “The Office” fans, he invited former co-star Steve Carell to join for his first installment.
Introducing his new series, Krasinski told viewers he had “no idea” what he was doing.
As a treat for fans who have begged for a cast reunion, he invited Carell to share some memories of the nine-season series.
“You are my newest and biggest hero,” Krasinski told her.
