Fight that coronavirus lockdown boredom with — your very own Faroe Islander!
The North Atlantic archipelago — on many must-go-to lists until the deadly pandemic — has thought up a unique way of entertaining prospective visitors: having them “control” a local during a guided tour.
A new digital tool launched by Visit Faroe Islands pairs travelers with a resident “who will be their avatar on the ground, taking them on a live virtual tour of the islands,” the islands’ tourism department said in a marketing push.
Locals are equipped with video cameras and armchair travelers can control the avatars with a joystick.
The residents will “run” or “jump,” but only if the commands don’t put them in harm’s way.
