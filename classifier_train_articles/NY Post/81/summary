Emily Hampshire, aka “Schitt’s Creek” motel owner Stevie Budd, is convinced Tuesday night’s series finale will please its legion of fans.
The series derives much of its charm from the inhabitants of Schitt’s Creek, particularly flannel-wearing Stevie (Hampshire), who owns the Rosebud Motel into which the Rose clan moves (she eventually goes into business with Johnny).
“She was this hard shell at the beginning and through the seasons she’s peeled back these layers to reveal who she really is without all the walls up.
Stevie taught me to be a better friend, and that comes from Dan, who created this amazing human being.”The friendship between the “Schitt’s Creek” actors continued after the series wrapped last July, Hampshire says.
“It’s with Adrien Brody and is set in 1850, so I was excited to go from ‘Schitt’s Creek’ to 1850 wearing a corset,” she says.
