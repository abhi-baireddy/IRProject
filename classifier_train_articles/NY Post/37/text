Floridians didn’t waste any time getting back to the sun and surf when beaches and parks were reopened in Jacksonville — the same day the state clocked a record number of coronavirus cases.

Crowds were seen cheering and rushing the beach as police removed the barriers around 5 p.m. Friday, CNN reported.

Aerial photos show hundreds of people packing the sand to swim, stroll, surf and fish. Many were without masks.

“We all live on it, so it has been torture looking at it and not being able to be out here,” one beachgoer told CNN.

Jacksonville opened beaches from 6-11 a.m. and 5-8 p.m. daily, with some restrictions including no sunbathing or lounging in chairs or on blankets.

“This can be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life,” Mayor Lenny Curry reportedly said.

Curry made the call after Gov. Ron DeSantis gave the green light for some municipalities to begin reopening beaches.

Police were seen warning people who didn’t adhere to the no-sunbathing rule, according to photos posted to social media, while a flyover sign warned people: “Do your part. Stay 6 feet apart. Help keep beaches open.”

Florida announced 1,400 new cases Friday, the highest 24-hour toll since the pandemic began.
