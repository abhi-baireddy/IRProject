Taylor Swift has canceled her 2020 tour dates — including her Lover Fests — due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Her planned U.S. shows will instead take place in 2021.
“I’m so sad I won’t be able to see you guys in concert this year, but I know this is the right decision,” Swift tweeted Friday.
Health organizations and governments around the world have strongly discouraged large public gatherings for an undetermined period of time,” Swift’s team said in a statement.
Both two-day festivals will now take place at to-be-determined dates in 2021.
