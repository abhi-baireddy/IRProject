Mayor Bill de Blasio announced late Sunday that the Big Apple’s nightlife will shut down and its restaurants and bars will only provide takeout or delivery service as authorities struggle to get ahead of the mounting coronavirus pandemic.
The restrictions mean that bars, cafes and restaurants must close their dining rooms and will only be able to serve takeout customers or fill delivery orders.
Additionally, de Blasio is ordering that nightclubs, movie theaters, concert venues and playhouses not shuttered when authorities ordered the lights out on Broadway be closed down too.
“This virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together,” de Blasio’s statement said.
