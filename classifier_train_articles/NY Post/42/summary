Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, Radiohead, Metallica and other iconic bands are all releasing archived or unseen concert footage on YouTube to help entertain fans during the coronavirus pandemic.
The rare videos began hitting the groups’ channels last Thursday, according to Forbes, and will continue rolling out on a weekly basis.
Commenters have already queued up for the virtual concert, with many expressing their excitement in a live chat.
“​Tuning guitars so I can play along at home, neighbors are going to love me,” writes fan Time Graham.
Radiohead opened its archived concert release with a premiere of “Live From A Tent in Dublin,” recorded during their “Kid A” tour in 2000.
