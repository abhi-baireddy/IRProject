Maybe this will help everyone feel a bit more comfortably numb.

Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, Radiohead, Metallica and other iconic bands are all releasing archived or unseen concert footage on YouTube to help entertain fans during the coronavirus pandemic. The rare videos began hitting the groups’ channels last Thursday, according to Forbes, and will continue rolling out on a weekly basis.

In addition to the short-form videos Pink Floyd has long been screening from its archives Fridays at 12 p.m. EST, the British rock group is also now releasing entire concert films. This includes “Pulse,” a recording of the group’s 1994 “The Division Bell” tour performance at London’s now-demolished Earls Court venue, available on YouTube on Friday.

Commenters have already queued up for the virtual concert, with many expressing their excitement in a live chat.

“​Tuning guitars so I can play along at home, neighbors are going to love me,” writes fan Time Graham. “Gotta find some acid,” writes another.

The Grateful Dead is now hosting a “Shakedown Stream” event on Fridays, which began on April 10 with a showing of 1989’s “Truckin’ Up to Buffalo.” The group is also fielding donations for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund.

Radiohead opened its archived concert release with a premiere of “Live From A Tent in Dublin,” recorded during their “Kid A” tour in 2000.

Metallica has begun its Metallica Mondays, featuring broadcasts of previously unreleased, pre-pandemic live shows, and will continue with the weekly streams — in addition to now soliciting donations for COVID-19 relief through the group’s All Within My Hands foundation.

Starting Saturday, April 18, Genesis is revealing five concert films. The group is starting off the series with its 1981 “Abacab” album tour.

The National has also promised fans rare footage, with money raised going to the group’s crew, which is out of work since the band’s concerts were cancelled due to the coronavirus.
