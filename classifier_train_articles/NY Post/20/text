The night of March 6 was supposed to be one of the most exciting for high school basketball fans in Indiana.

About 2,800 fans packed the gym at Lawrence Central High School in Indianapolis for the sectional semi-finals.

Little did anyone know that five people in the gym that night would later die from health complications caused by the coronavirus, according to the Indianapolis Star.

At least a dozen others who were there have tested positive or experienced symptoms consistent with the virus.

“The problem with any communal event like a basketball tournament is that you’ve got a clustering of people in close proximity,” said Dr. Cole Beeler, infectious diseases doctor at Indiana University Health, told the Star.

Paul Loggan, 57 and Roscoe Taylor, 43, were there, cheering teams on. So was Charles Johnson, 78, three rows up behind the Warren Central bench and next to his wife, Kay. Larry Rush, 67, was there, too, in the Lawrence North High School section, one of the “Four Horsemen” of Wildcat fans. Jim DeSalle, 70, sat for the second game, near the Lawrence North bench.

Within weeks, those five men would be dead from coronavirus-related conditions.

There is no way to know exactly how the virus spread.

“The sad thing looking back,” said Kay Johnson, the widow of Charles Johnson, “is that we didn’t know.”
