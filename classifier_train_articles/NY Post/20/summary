The night of March 6 was supposed to be one of the most exciting for high school basketball fans in Indiana.
About 2,800 fans packed the gym at Lawrence Central High School in Indianapolis for the sectional semi-finals.
Larry Rush, 67, was there, too, in the Lawrence North High School section, one of the “Four Horsemen” of Wildcat fans.
Jim DeSalle, 70, sat for the second game, near the Lawrence North bench.
“The sad thing looking back,” said Kay Johnson, the widow of Charles Johnson, “is that we didn’t know.”
