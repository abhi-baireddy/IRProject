“I loved Austin,” Dan said.
“So I said, ‘What if we started a sanctuary for farm animals?’”The farm, in Chelsea, Michigan, was on 70 acres and in disrepair.
In 2017, after a year of flying between the farm and Austin, Dan moved back to Michigan full time.
“I tried dating, but I’m kind of married to the animals right now,” Dan said.
