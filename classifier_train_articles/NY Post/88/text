We’re coming to the last bend in the journey down “Schitt’s Creek.”

Pop TV released a trailer Friday for the sixth and final season of Dan Levy’s heartwarming sitcom about the dysfunctional, displaced Rose family. In the series, Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy, Dan’s father on the show and in real life), his wife Moira (Catherine O’Hara), son David (Dan Levy) and daughter Alexis (Annie Murphy) relocate to the crassly-named backwoods town of the show’s title after losing their family fortune and stately mansion — not to mention their dignity.

In the trailer, there are lots of feathers (on Moira’s head) and a face-slap (at Moira’s hand) — and it seems fans can expect many hugs to complement the humor as family and friends contemplate their futures heading into the series finale.

The Roses, who own a run-down local motel, are still scheming to find a way out of tiny Schitt’s Creek, but despite the family’s half-dozen seasons of heartache, Johnny is somehow thankful for their bad fortune. “My family and I have been staying in a motel for the past three years, and I wouldn’t trade our stay there for anything,” he says in a poignant scene.

And good luck not shedding a tear as David’s fiancé Patrick (Noah Reid) tells Johnny, “As lucky as I feel to have met David, I also feel incredibly lucky to be joining your family.”

The Emmy- and SAG-nominated show’s cast also features Emily Hampshire as deadpan motel manager Stevie, who is also looking for new career possibilities; Chris Elliott as town mayor Roland Schitt; and Dustin Milligan as veterinarian Ted, who is engaged to Alexis.

The final, 14-episode season of “Schitt’s Creek” kicks off at 9 p.m. on Jan. 7, 2020, on Pop TV.
