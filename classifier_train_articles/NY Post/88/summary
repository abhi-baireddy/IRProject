We’re coming to the last bend in the journey down “Schitt’s Creek.”Pop TV released a trailer Friday for the sixth and final season of Dan Levy’s heartwarming sitcom about the dysfunctional, displaced Rose family.
In the trailer, there are lots of feathers (on Moira’s head) and a face-slap (at Moira’s hand) — and it seems fans can expect many hugs to complement the humor as family and friends contemplate their futures heading into the series finale.
The Roses, who own a run-down local motel, are still scheming to find a way out of tiny Schitt’s Creek, but despite the family’s half-dozen seasons of heartache, Johnny is somehow thankful for their bad fortune.
“My family and I have been staying in a motel for the past three years, and I wouldn’t trade our stay there for anything,” he says in a poignant scene.
The final, 14-episode season of “Schitt’s Creek” kicks off at 9 p.m. on Jan. 7, 2020, on Pop TV.
