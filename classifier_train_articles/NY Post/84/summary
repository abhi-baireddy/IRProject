Season 3 of “Fauda” finds Israeli Defense Force member Doron Kavillio (series star Lior Raz) working undercover in the Gaza Strip, as the Netflix series continues its dramatization of the ongoing (and deadly) Arab-Israeli conflict.
While Season 3 of “Fauda” (which means “chaos” in Arabic) changes locales to Gaza from the West Bank (Seasons 1 and 2), Raz says the series couldn’t shoot there.
“It was a big challenge for us to find a location that looks like Gaza,” Raz says.
“[Season 3] is a standalone season, so people can watch it as the first season.
“And I think [Season 3] it’s a much darker season,” he says.
