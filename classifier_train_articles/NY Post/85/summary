Newcomer Maitreyi Ramakrishnan was plucked from an audition pool of 15,000 hopeful actresses to star in Mindy Kaling’s Netflix show, “Never Have I Ever.”When Kaling and co-creator Lang Fisher called to tell her she landed the widely coveted role, “I remember all that I said was, ‘That’s crazy!” Ramakrishnan, 18, tells The Post.
