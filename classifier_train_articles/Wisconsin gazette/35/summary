At the same time, staff teachers must still go to work and stay locked in those buildings for a whole work day, even though classes have been cancelled.

it is not fair that staff teachers are being treated unequally to part-time and outsourced teachers, as if the full-time staff doesnâ€™t matter!
We need the state to let all DOC teachers stay safely at home.
They, like the other DOC teachers, deserve the right to protect themselves and their families from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.
