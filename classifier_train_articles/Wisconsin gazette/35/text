I'm writing this to expose the Department of Corrections’ lack of responsibility in times of a pandemic.

My husband is a teacher at a DOC facility in southeast Wisconsin, and the reality there is that part-time and outsourced employees have been released and can stay safely home, with full paid administrative leave. At the same time, staff teachers must still go to work and stay locked in those buildings for a whole work day, even though classes have been cancelled.

Staff teachers have families, most of them with kids. So why are they being coerced to get out of their homes when no classes are being taught in prisons? What is going to happen when the number of infections reach an all-time high (pretty soon according to researchers) and teachers are infected?

it is not fair that staff teachers are being treated unequally to part-time and outsourced teachers, as if the full-time staff doesn’t matter!

The state has proven to be incompetent in dealing with this pandemic, and it is appalling to see that no action has been taken to protect staff teachers. Gov. Tony Evers, what a shame. I can't find the words to say how disappointed we all are with your lack of action.

This has to end. We need the state to let all DOC teachers stay safely at home. They, like the other DOC teachers, deserve the right to protect themselves and their families from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Action must be taken now, or it will be too late.

I am sharing this information so the whole state of Wisconsin can know how incompetent this administration has been in dealing with state teachers at the DOC.
