Dua Lipa has to write "during the day" in "bright and airy" studios.
The 'New Rules' hitmaker has admitted that she works best in daylight and can't stand working in "dark" spaces with dinghy lighting.
"I like to write during the day, I'm not such a big fan of, like, dark studios with purple lighting."
hitmaker, she replied: "I just love them so much: their voice; the way they write; the person that they are and what they stand for.
"I'm trying to pick my favorite Sam song ... 'I'm Not The Only One' is a heart-breaker."
