Erykah Badu didn't make any profit on her first livestream from her Quarantine Concert Series.
The 49-year-old artist only charged fans $1 each to log in to her first livestream and while she didn't make any profit, she insisted it was worth it as it helped her to iron out any technical glitches.
I didn't make any [profit] the first time, but it was a learning experience and I figured I'd take one for the team."
Erykah - whose first livestream performance was dubbed 'Apocalypse One' - admitted charging so little is not sustainable but insisted that she will start to charge more.
"'Apocalypse Two' was $2, and 'Apocalypse Three' will be $3, and as I progress my productions will get more elaborate as well.
