The 'High School Musical' cast will reunite for a special 'Disney Family Singalong'.
Filmmaker Kenny Ortega - who directed the 2006 musical - told Deadline: "We couldn't reach Zac until late but when we did, he immediately jumped in, of course.
Kenny insisted the song itself has been an anthem of sorts during the coronavirus pandemic, with the lyrics providing some comfort to people.
"It's a really nice fun coming together of a lot of young people that are banding together under the lyrics of this song for the show."
There are young people out there that look up to these people and have for a long time.
