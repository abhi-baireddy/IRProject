Without it, there isn’t a straightforward way to determine whether a ballot has been processed by the Postal Service by Election Day.
But Monday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling inserted the requirement that absentee ballots be postmarked by April 7.
According to the Postal Service, postmarks are not required for for mailings bearing a permit, meter or precanceled stamp for postage, which applies to at least some absentee ballots.
Issues with postmarks come on top of numerous other problems, such as voters not receiving their absentee ballots despite requesting them weeks ago.
Incoming absentee ballots are locked inside a vault inside the clerk’s office, and ballots cast on election day were put in sealed bags and securely stored.
