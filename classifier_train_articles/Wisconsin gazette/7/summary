"I talked to (former UW athletic director Pat Richter), I talked to (former Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delaney) and I talked to President Bush.
"But in one of it's toughest moments, baseball was able to play a small role in the country coming back."
"When President Bush walked to the mound, gave a thumbs-up and threw the first pitch ... that was a special moment," Counsell said.
Counsell and Selig are both optimistic baseball can once again provide joy for a weary nation.
