Khloe Kardashian has been paying for elderly people's food shopping.
The 35-year-old reality star has reportedly been visiting various grocery stores in her area to take on the cost of food bought by elderly shoppers in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
Last month, the 22-year-old billionaire and her beauty line were confirmed to have teamed up with beauty conglomerate and Kylie Skin investor, Coty, to distribute the antibacterial gels to hospitals in California.
The hand sanitiser also included a special message for recipients, which read: "Dedicated to first responders working to support our communities."
A representative for Kylie Skin confirmed that the hand sanitiser will be made by Coty's factories and will not affect the production of Kylie Skin products.
