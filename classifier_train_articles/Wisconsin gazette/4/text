Khloe Kardashian has been paying for elderly people's food shopping.

The 35-year-old reality star has reportedly been visiting various grocery stores in her area to take on the cost of food bought by elderly shoppers in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

Elderly people are among those most at risk of dying from the respiratory virus, and so many stores have been setting aside specific hours for them to buy the food they need to self-isolate at home.

According to TMZ, the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star has been visiting Trader Joe's and Ralphs stores in the Los Angeles area, where she's been stepping in to foot the bill of vulnerable shoppers.

Khloe has also reportedly helped out those working at the stores, by purchasing store gift cards for over 200 employees among various locations she visited, with the intention of giving the ability to buy food for themselves and their families.

The 'Revenge Body' star's kind deed comes after her sister Kim Kardashian West made a million dollar donation through her SKIMS shapewear brand to help fight coronavirus - which is also known as COVID-19.

Kylie Jenner has also donated a million dollars to relief funds for the virus, as well as transforming her skincare brand, Kylie Skin, into a hand sanitiser production factory.

Last month, the 22-year-old billionaire and her beauty line were confirmed to have teamed up with beauty conglomerate and Kylie Skin investor, Coty, to distribute the antibacterial gels to hospitals in California.

The hand sanitiser also included a special message for recipients, which read: "Dedicated to first responders working to support our communities."

A representative for Kylie Skin confirmed that the hand sanitiser will be made by Coty's factories and will not affect the production of Kylie Skin products.
