Prince Harry "almost" feels "guilt" about enjoying family time during the coronavirus pandemic.
He said: "There's a hell of a lot of positives that are happening at the same time and being able to have family time -- so much family time -- that you almost think, 'Do I feel guilty for having so much family time?'
"Inevitably, half an hour later, maybe a day later, there's going to be something that you have to deal with and there's no way you can run away from it."
Harry admitted life is currently very "strange" and it is unusual for so many people to be having shared experiences.
The prince urged them to "keep going" and promised to speak to them again in the near future.
