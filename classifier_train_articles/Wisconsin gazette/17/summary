A new study has begun to determine how many adults in the US without a confirmed history of infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 have antibodies to the virus.
Researchers will collect and analyze blood samples from as many as 10,000 volunteers to provide critical data for epidemiological models.
The study's results will help illuminate the extent to which the novel coronavirus has spread undetected in the US.
In blood samples found to contain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, researchers may perform additional tests to evaluate the volunteers’ immune responses to the virus.
“With a small finger-pick, volunteers can help scientists fight COVID-19 from their homes.”People interested in joining this study should contact clinicalstudiesunit@nih.gov.
