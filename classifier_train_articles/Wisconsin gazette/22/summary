Wisconsin faces a deadline of April 16 to qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding.
Almost all of the other states have already qualified for the funding, and they have typically done so by executive branch action.
That could cost the state about $50 million for each month of the year in which the national emergency is in effect.
Act 370 prevents those changes from being made without approval of the full legislature, and it has also blocked other Medicaid changes necessitated by the looming health care crisis.
If the Legislature fails to act, Medicaid will be a much weaker tool in Wisconsin than it should be as health care providers battle the pandemic.
