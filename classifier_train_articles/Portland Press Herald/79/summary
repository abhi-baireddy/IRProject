Maine Medical Center has joined two worldwide human clinical trials for remdesivir, a possible treatment for moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.
No patients at Maine Med with moderate cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus are yet enrolled.
Public health experts who are not part of the study have expressed hope in initial research conducted before the human clinical trials, but stress that the clinical trials are crucial.
All Maine Med patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who meet the criteria will be asked if they want to join the clinical trial.
Maine Med had 24 COVID-19 patients on Tuesday, a spokeswoman confirmed.
