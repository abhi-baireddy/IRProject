A fifth person has tested positive for the coronavirus at a Falmouth retirement community.
A spokesperson for OceanView at Falmouth said Friday evening that another resident has tested positive for the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which was first detected in China and then rapidly spread around the word.
Varrell said the fifth case was connected to the first two cases reported this week, which were the result of close household contact.
As of Friday, Maine reported that 56 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus, with Cumberland County being the epicenter with 35 cases.
The facility offers a range of social events for residents, including fitness programs, dances, cocktail hours and group outings.
