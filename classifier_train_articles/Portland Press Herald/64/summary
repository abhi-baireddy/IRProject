Janet Mills’ administration repeatedly flouted Maine’s open meetings and public records laws in the past few weeks as members met secretly with lawmakers and others to discuss the coronavirus pandemic.
“The coronavirus has temporarily shifted the way that government business is conducted, but the Administration maintains its commitment to transparency,” Lindsay Crete, Mills’ press secretary, wrote to the Press Herald.
The administration also did not give any public notice of the meetings, or allow public access as required by law.
Crete detailed nine remote meetings conducted by administration officials with lawmakers between March 20 and April 15.
Maine’s public meeting law does exclude meetings of party caucuses, but it is unclear why Mills, a Democrat, met separately with Democrats and Republicans.
