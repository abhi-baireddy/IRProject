Itâ€™s a growing concern as summer approaches in a state that has branded itself as Vacationland.
Local officials are trying to send messages that are kind but firm to seasonal residents, knowing those people may have longtime ties to their communities.
Snyder said municipal officials have been working together to carefully craft the right messages to send to their usual seasonal residents.
Some summer residents used to live here full time and now head south for the winter.
The town is working on an order to be considered by the select board that encourages seasonal residents to delay their arrival in town.
