The face shields create a barrier.
“These will help protect us from any splash, or any in person contact,” said Biddeford Deputy Fire Chief Kevin Duross.
TPNE has recently donated 1,000 of the face shields to Biddeford police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel.
“Two weeks ago, we realized the need for face shields, and we immediately knew we could help address the shortage.
“We’ve had several requests for the shield … and requests to partner,” said Tyson of the company’s efforts to produce shields for donation and for vendors.
