Yet, this piece is supposed to be about the Edge ST, Ford’s Performance SUV model.
Both of these mid-size crossovers will be about the same size; 189-inches long for the Edge, three inches less for the Mach-E.
Here, the Edge ST produces rapid acceleration with a very lineal delivery of torque—the Ford feels powerful and ready to go at any throttle setting, with the 8-speed automatic perfectly handling your pedal requests.
While 335-hp isn’t that outlandish in this day and age, the output from the Ecoboost engine makes the Edge ST feel strong, willing, and sporty.
A lot to like in the Edge ST.
