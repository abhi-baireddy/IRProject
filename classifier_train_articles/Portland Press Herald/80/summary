The ambitious goal is to stop – not just slow – the destructive power of COVID-19 through the tedious, yet powerful public health tool called contact tracing.
Local public health workers across the U.S. are already using this strategy with COVID-19 – a few cases at a time.
Galea said contact tracing is usually more effective at the beginning of an epidemic, before a disease like COVID-19 has spread.
Massachusetts may be rolling out the most robust expansion of contact tracing so far, but Utah, North Dakota and other states are also launching projects.
The Partners in Health project is set to continue through October and wind down in January 2021.
