When McCarty pitched for the Portland Sea Dogs, from 2013-16, he was the first to admit he was not a prospect – although don’t be dismissive of his on-field accomplishments.
He was named the Sea Dogs’ Citizen of the Year three straight seasons, recognizing his contributions in the community.
And McCarthy continues to volunteer for Baseball Miracles, an organization that brings baseball to impoverished areas around the world.
Injuries limited McCarthy in 2016 (12 games, five starts), and the Red Sox let him go after the season.
When Kapler finally interviewed McCarthy, it was long distance – McCarthy was in Argentina on a Baseball Miracles trip.
