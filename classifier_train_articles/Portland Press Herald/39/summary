The number of daily calls to the state child abuse hotline have fallen 32 percent since Maine schools began closing their doors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Child advocates say the sudden decline in child abuse reports does not mean that Maine children are safe from harm â€“ it means fewer people are around to report it.
HOW TO GET HELP To report child abuse or neglect call 1-800-452-1999, or dial 711 if you are deaf or hard of hearing.
Other states are reporting similar mid-March declines in child abuse and neglect complaints, Landry said.
In the second half of March, school staff accounted for only 7 percent of child abuse referrals.
