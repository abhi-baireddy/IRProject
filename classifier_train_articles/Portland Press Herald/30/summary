JAY — The explosion that rocked the Androscoggin Mill on Wednesday afternoon left many with a sickening sense of deja vu.
Joel Davis said, “but by the grace of God, it turned out much different today.”The explosion, Davis said, occurred in the digester area of the mill.
News of the explosion spread fast across social media, with a video of the blast circulating quickly on Facebook and several news sites.
Later Wednesday afternoon, mill officials were securing the blast site, making sure it was safe for investigators to enter.
Davis, state fire investigator, said his team was expecting to go in early Thursday morning.
