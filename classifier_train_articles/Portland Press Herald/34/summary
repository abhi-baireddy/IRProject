Rachael Ray had big plans for the quarantine break at her home in upstate New York.
“We have never worked this hard in our entire lives,” said Ray, who is taping “#STAYHOME With Rachael” two days a week from her home.
The animal lover says “a lot of the shelters can’t afford to keep going, there’s no workers.
No, she’s not afraid that she might contract the virus, she’s “absolutely scared to death” of the 85-year-old tough Sicilian who lives across the street.
“I’m scared because she’s tough,” Ray said.
