Janet Mills mandated on Tuesday that all nonessential public-facing businesses close to the public for the next two weeks but stopped short of a statewide “stay at home” order.
“Given that what we are detecting in any outbreak is only the tip of the iceberg, now is the time to start taking public health action,” he said.
The executive order also orders the closure of nonessential businesses where more than 10 employees work in a space where “physical distancing” is not possible.
Those businesses would still be allowed to continue operations that do not require in-person contact with customers or gatherings.
Public health officials say shoppers should leave reusable bags at home because coronavirus can live on surfaces like those bags for hours and even days.
