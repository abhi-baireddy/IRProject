Traffic in Maine is down to about half its normal volume, meaning road crews can speed up repair projects and shift more of the work to daylight hours, which is less costly and safer.
“We wouldn’t do this during normal situations because traffic would be so bad,” said Erin Courtney, spokeswoman for the turnpike authority.
Because of the work, traffic will be down to one lane in both directions near the Kennebunk service plazas at least part of the time, she said.
Turnpike traffic has been running at about 50 percent of its normal volume this spring, Courtney said.
Merrill said the work had been planned for early summer, after schools let out for the year, to avoid disrupting local traffic.
