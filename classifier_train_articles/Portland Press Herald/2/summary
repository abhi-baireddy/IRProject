“Contact tracing, enormously important,” said Frieden, who served as head of CDC from 2009 to 2017 under President Obama.
Not even a month ago, Maine CDC used a group of eight to 10 staff epidemiologists to track the spread of communicable diseases and mosquito and tick-borne illnesses.
But the new federal guidelines issued Thursday call for even more, prompting Maine to double its tracking workforce.
The same is happening across New England, with every state now considering expansions of their contact tracing efforts.
Even Rhode Island, with a population of about a million, has 100 people doing nothing but contact tracing.
