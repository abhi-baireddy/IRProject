LEWISTON — Early Thursday morning, before the snow began to fall, meteorologist Mike Haggett warned that the coming storm would be one to remember.
“This storm will go into our memory banks and remembered in the years ahead,” Haggett wrote on his Pine Tree Weather page.
Come the commuter hour, reports of car wrecks, vehicles off roads and wires down were rolling in from all over the region.
At 9 p.m., Central Maine Power reported that roughly 79,000 customers were without power.
Central Maine Power crews, already beleaguered by downed wires in other areas, were said to be on the way.
