But then a friend who is a registered nurse told her about the shortage of face masks and other PPE facing many health care professionals.
By early this week, she had made 181 face masks â€“ with 130 delivered to a home health and hospice agency in central Maine where her friend works.
For adult-sized masks, Franck has added a metal nose clamp by straightening a paper clip and sewing that into place.
All the shields Haystack produces will be donated free of charge.
Bowdoin College and the University of Southern Maine have also used their 3D printing capabilities to produce face shields.
