A medical marijuana provider has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn a Maine rule that says only state residents or companies majority-owned by state residents can obtain adult-use marijuana sales permits.
For example, the lawsuit alleges, Wellness Connection is currently 51 percent-owned by Mainers.
Medical marijuana sales last year were $111 million, it says, and the expectation is that adult recreational use sales will be even greater.
Some other states that have adopted adult-use marijuana sales originally put in place residency requirements that favored state residents.
