LANSING, Mich. — Thousands of flag-waving, honking protesters drove past the Michigan Capitol on Wednesday to show their displeasure with Gov.
Gretchen Whitmer’s orders to keep people at home and businesses locked during the coronavirus outbreak.
“This arbitrary blanket spread of shutting down businesses, about putting all of these workers out of business, is just a disaster.
“The majority of demonstrators remained in their vehicles, and most of those who were on foot were practicing social distancing,” Banner said.
Four sheriffs in the northwestern Lower Peninsula called Whitmer’s orders a “vague framework of emergency laws” that are frustrating citizens.
