JAY â€” Investigators began Thursday to try to figure out what caused an explosion at the Androscoggin Mill that left part of the complex a smoking ruin but caused no serious injuries.
It was sold in January by the Ohio-based Verso Corp. to Pixelle Specialty Solutions, the largest specialty paper producer in North America.
Pixelle itself said it had four specialty paper mills, including the one in Jay, and only three of them also produced pulp.
Craig Aderman, a retired stationary steam engineer from Freeport, said he worked for years for Sappi Global, which has paper mills in Skowhegan and Westbrook.
At a new conference late Wednesday afternoon, Mills hailed the fact that nobody was seriously hurt in the Jay explosion.
