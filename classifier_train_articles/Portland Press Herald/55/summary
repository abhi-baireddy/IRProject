A $19 billion aid package for American farmers will provide direct support to producers and massive purchases for the country’s food banks.
The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, announced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday, is intended to stabilize the country’s food producers as they weather the pandemic’s effects.
The department will provide $16 billion in direct aid to producers to offset losses created by lost demand and short-term oversupply during the pandemic.
It plans to buy $100 million worth of meat, $100 million of produce and $100 million per month.
Pingree urged Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to make sure small farmers and local food economies like Maine’s received support through the program.
