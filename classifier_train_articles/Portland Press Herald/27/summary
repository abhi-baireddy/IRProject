The city of Portland on Friday walked back new restrictions on how businesses can operate under a stay-at-home order that included prohibitions on shipping and curbside pick-up for non-essential businesses.
The move has been welcomed by business owners like Michelle Souliere, who owns Green Hand Bookshop on Congress Street and has been depending on customers’ mail orders since the March 24 order mandated that non-essential businesses close to the public.
The “FAQ for Businesses” document also said violations of the city order could be punished by a $500 fine and the loss or suspension of a business license.
The council is scheduled to hold an emergency remote workshop Monday to clarify the rules for non-essential businesses.
The order now says that non-essential businesses can access their brick-and-mortar premises for essential functions as long as social distancing protocols are followed and the fewest number of employees possible are on site.
