Later, turkey sandwiches became my midday meal of choice, with the cheese dropping out sometime in my 20s and white bread getting swapped for whole grain.
Now, the decision to eat a sandwich at all is fraught: Is it really worth it?
At Portland panini shop The Local Press, it always is.
The Local Press, however, has very much embraced the reality of our current situation, and as carb-cutting has dropped a few rungs among my concerns, I have embraced The Local Press.
Thatâ€™s led me, most often, to the Beacon Street, a turkey panini with avocado, tomato, red onion, hot pepper relish, provolone and mayonnaise for $9.50.
