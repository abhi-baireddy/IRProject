“It’s my hope that these actions will provide some sense of relief both financial and emotional to Maine people struggling to make ends meet,” Mills said.
State officials have been closely tracking outbreaks at long-term care facilities in the state, whose residents are particularly vulnerable.
That’s why she took action to prevent evictions of tenants, except in cases where tenants engage in dangerous or unlawful conduct.
Mills also has sent letters to Maine financial institutions urging them to work with homeowners and small businesses experiencing financial hardship and not move forward with foreclosures because they cannot pay mortgages.
Also, in letters sent to Maine financial institutions, the governor also urged all financial institutions to work proactively with Maine homeowners and small businesses experiencing financial hardship from COVID-19 to help keep them in their homes and storefronts.
