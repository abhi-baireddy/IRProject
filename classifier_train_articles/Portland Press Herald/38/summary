Masterson said health officials at the two Portland hospitals have indicated to her that the need for nearby hotel rooms for their staff could increase in the next two weeks.
Masterson said donating rooms to health care workers was “our opportunity to be good partners in the face of this crisis and really support” the employees at both Mercy Hospital and Maine Medical, the flagship hospital of MaineHealth.
But there are exemptions for renting rooms to workers in essential jobs, health care workers, as well as to the homeless, children in emergency situations and people at risk of domestic violence.
To protect all groups, including the Clarion staff, the health care workers will be isolated on two floors of the hotel, with a designated elevator and entrance for their use with an expedited check-in process.
Health care guests will be asked to place any used linens or towels in provided trash bags, which will be kept separate for 72 hours before being washed in a high-heat cycle.
