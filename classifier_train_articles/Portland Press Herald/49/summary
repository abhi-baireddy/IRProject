The city of Portland issued an order Tuesday for all residents to stay at home starting Wednesday evening, effectively shutting down all businesses that do not provide essential goods or services.
The statewide order allows non-public facing businesses to continue operating under conditions to ensure workers can keep at least 6 feet from each other.
Portland is calling for nonessential businesses to shut down workspaces and operate only if they can do so remotely, although it also allows exceptions.
Violations of the order are punishable by a fine of up to $500 per person or business for each infraction.
That order was superseded days later by a statewide order by the governor.
