TOKYO — Nippon Professional Baseball’s season openers will not take place in May because of the new coronavirus pandemic, with no firm date set for the start.
The removal of 18 interleague games from each team’s calendar would make for a 125-game regular season.
Although no specific date had been set to start the season, the representatives agreed in an online meeting to not start before the end of May.
The interleague games between the Central and Pacific leagues have started in May since the format was established in 2005.
This year’s original early start was designed to allow for a three-week break in the summer for the Tokyo Olympics.
