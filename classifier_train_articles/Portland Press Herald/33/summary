Janet Mills said Friday that she would soon be releasing a plan on how to reopen Maine, even as the state reported 31 new cases and two more deaths from COVID-19.
Mills provided no details about the timing of the reopening or how it would be carried out.
She said she has been working with New Hampshire and Vermont on regional planning for COVID-19 reopening, but so far the talks have been informal.
â€œAt the same time, we all know that reopening too soon and too aggressively will likely cause a secondary surge in COVID-19 cases, jeopardizing the lives of Maine people and further destabilizing the economy.
The deaths reported Friday bring the total number of lives lost in Maine to 29 and the total number of confirmed cases to 827.
