WASHINGTON — The United States’ top infectious disease expert said Sunday that the economy in parts of the country could have a “rolling re-entry” as early as next month, provided health authorities can quickly identify and isolate people who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus.
Dr. Anthony Fauci also said he “can’t guarantee” that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, Nov. 3.
Once the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to “think about a gradual re-entry of some sort of normality, some rolling re-entry,” Fauci said.
Whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, “we know that there will be people who will be getting infected.
Increased testing would allow authorities to identify, isolate and trace the contacts of people who are newly infected, Fauci said.
