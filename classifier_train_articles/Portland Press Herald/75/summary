AUGUSTA â€” Applications are open for the Allagash Wilderness Waterway Visiting Artist Program, which brings artists to the remote wilderness of Maine for two-weeks of solitude.
The program provides artists with the opportunity to immerse themselves in a remote, rustic wilderness, to interpret and share their experiences through their medium, according to a news release from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
For summer 2020, one chosen artist and a guest will receive complimentary lodging at the AWW Lock Dam Camp for two weeks during August, and orientation by AWW rangers.
Lock Dam Camp is a one-room cabin on the northern end of Chamberlain Lake, one of the largest and deepest lakes in the North Maine Woods.
