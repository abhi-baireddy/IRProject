Yet child welfare agencies in Maine and around the country are reporting a dramatic decrease in reports of child abuse and neglect, perhaps because of that very loss of social support.
• The Maine Office of Child and Family Services has just issued guidance on identifying child abuse and neglect during this crisis.
• The Maine Department of Health and Human Services website has information for mandated reporters on reporting child abuse and neglect at maine.gov/dhhs/mandated-reporters.shtml; visit jpmaweb.com/product/mandated-reporter/ to view a training video.
Even before the current social and economic crisis, Maine Child Protective Services was documenting an increase in child abuse in the state.
Statistics from 2017 and 2018 show that substantiations of child abuse and neglect increased from 2,160 to 2,665, almost a 25 percent increase in one year.
