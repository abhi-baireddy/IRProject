Walker, the company that makes Allen’s Coffee Flavored Brandy, will release the first new style of the beloved tipple in almost a generation.
Allen’s Cold Brew Coffee Flavored Brandy will make its way into Maine stores in early May, said M.S.
Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coffee grounds in cool water for 12 hours or more.
This is the first new iteration of Allen’s Coffee Flavored Brandy since the company tried out multiple flavored versions about 20 years ago, Shaw said.
The Pine Tree State is the only major market for Allen’s Coffee Flavored Brandy.
