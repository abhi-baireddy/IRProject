MARSHFIELD, Vt. — They were far away from home – young adults from Latin America, working seasonally at U.S. ski resorts.
In Colorado, about 80 Ecuadorian workers for Vail Resorts are stranded.
Ecuador closed its borders the same week Vail shut its resorts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Some workers are staying with family or friends in the U.S., but many didn’t have anywhere to go.
Vail Resorts CEO Rob Katz and his wife have donated $1 million to create a new fund to help active, furloughed and seasonal employees who intend to return to work when the crisis eases.
