With the Maine high school spring sports season cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, athletic trainers in central Maine found a new role, helping those in the medical field at the front of the battle against Covid-19.
He foresaw this coming along,” said Jill Haskell, an athletic trainer with MaineGeneral since 2001.
It took a few days of training to get the MaineGeneral athletic training ready for their new roles.
The first day, we had four athletic trainers there, and we didn’t have one kid cry,” Haskell said.
The athletic trainers will continue to conduct the screenings at each of the day care facilities for as long as necessary.
