Consumers should throw away any romaine lettuce, and retailers and restaurants should not sell or serve it, the CDC said.
At least 32 people in 11 states have gotten sick from the same strain of E. coli in the outbreak.
However, the outbreak is not related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from earlier this year – which killed five people and sickened 210 in 36 states – the CDC said.
