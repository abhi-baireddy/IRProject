CLOSE At four times its normal volume because of the coronavirus pandemic, the United Food Bank provided families with food at the Mesa Convention Center.
Arizona RepublicMore than 60 cars were already lined up at the Mesa Convention Center just after 5:30 a.m. Friday.
The demand forced United Food Bank out of its regular distribution center in Mesa and into the larger Mesa Convention Center downtown.
Nansel added that part of the reason United Food Bank holds its distribution on Fridays is because of schools' growing lack of food for children, especially on weekends.
Nansel said the food bank is asking for food and monetary donations.
