Arizona public officials now release coronavirus data by ZIP code.
The state Department of Health Services published its data as a map, showing a number of cases for each ZIP code.
For any ZIP code AZ Data Central could not locate within the state's data, that area is left blank.
The population for each ZIP code is derived from American Community Survey population data from 2014 to 2018.
A review of ZIP codes with large numbers of cases suggests the data may overstate the impact in ZIP codes with hospitals.
