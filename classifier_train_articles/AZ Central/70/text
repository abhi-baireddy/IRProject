An 18-year-old Phoenix man was identified as the driver killed in a fatal crash after fleeing from state troopers last Friday, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said Wednesday.

Eric Romero died after veering off the road and crashing into a maintenance structure near Rio Salado Park, close to Seventh Avenue and Elmwood Street, according to DPS officials.

Troopers tried to stop Romero for a traffic violation near Seventh Avenue and Interstate 17, and he fled south on Seventh Avenue at "a high rate of speed," DPS spokesman Bart Graves said in an email.

Romero did not survive the crash, Graves said. The car caught fire after colliding with the maintenance structure.

DPS did not say why Romero fled troopers.
