Orders to work from home have collided with orders to maintain social distancing, including for the technicians who help people set up and maintain those internet connections.
To ensure the safety of customers and workers, Cox Communications and CenturyLink no longer send technicians into homes.
They will make house calls, but installations and repairs are directed from outside, with help from willing customers in the home.
Initially, Cox provided workers additional protective equipment and allowed them to work as usual with some added precautions, like not shaking customers' hands.
If the connections in the attic or interior of the house were not done correctly, the service wouldn't work.
