(Photo: Donna Reiner/Special for The Republic)Someday our younger family members may ask what was it like during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I was 4 and my sister Ruth was just 8.
(We have a younger sister who was 2 at the time.)
But for some reason, my older sister and I came down with it about the same time while my younger sister did not.
Ruth knew she was going to have a baby, so it wasn't a surprise when she went to the hospital.
