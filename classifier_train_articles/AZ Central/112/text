Charges against a 92-year-old woman accused of fatally shooting her son may be dropped, as she is in hospice care after suffering a stroke in jail.

Anna Mae Blessing, who is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, was absent from her scheduled hearing Monday in Maricopa County Superior Court.

Her attorney, Jennine Burns, asked for the hearing to be rescheduled so the defense could file a new motion to have the case dismissed or sent back to the grand jury.

"Miss Blessing has significant health issues that I think will be impacting the scope of this case in the near future," Burns told Judge Susan Brnovich.

Blessing has missed multiple court dates since her arrest in July because of her ailing health.

Burns declined to elaborate on the status of Blessing's health when questioned by The Arizona Republic after the hearing, but court documents said Blessing had a stroke in jail on Nov. 9. She was released from custody and into hospice care shortly after.

She's unable to get out of bed or make it to court hearings, according to a request to waive her appearance filed last week.

Her next court date is scheduled for Dec. 17.

Blessing is accused of shooting her son July 2 because he wanted to move her into an assisted living facility. She shared a Fountain Hills apartment with her son and his girlfriend, but Blessing and other family members told deputies the relationship became strained.
