Migrant caravans from Central America this year have made the asylum issue part of the national conversation.
"I think what has gotten convoluted by the administration is the issue of immigration and the issue of asylum.

Rep.-elect Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democrat elected to replace McSally in January, said the asylum issue is among those she hopes will get attention in the new Congress.
