Incoming freshman athletes will have an easier time qualifying at Division I or II colleges, after the NCAA on Friday waived the standardized test scores because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Seniors still needing the test scores to qualify weren't able to take the tests in March and this month, because those opportunities to take the tests were being pushed back by the pandemic that caused schools across the nation to close.

ESPN reported that student-athletes now can qualify to play in Division I by having a 2.3 cumulative grade-point average in 10 core courses that are approved by the NCAA. For Division II, student-athletes must have at least a 2.2 GPA.

"That's huge," PHH Prep basketball director John Ortega said. "That makes two of our post-grad guys eligible.

"We're definitely going to try and use this to their advantage and find them a home this year."

Mesa Desert Ridge football coach Jeremy Hathcock said he thinks it might be too late for some kids because most of the scholarships for the 2020-21 academic year have been taken.

"However, I can see the kids get admitted to college now as a walk-on with the promise of a scholarship the next year and playing the next year," Hathcock said.

Chandler Hamilton football coach Mike Zdebski said one Division I college football coach told, "it changes nothing."

"The player still has to be admitted by the university," Zdebski said.

Scottsdale Saguaro football coach Jason Mohns said that the NCAA's waiver could open the door for some of the borderline qualifier kids.

"I don't think it will affect any of our guys because they were all good in the sliding scale," Mohns said.
