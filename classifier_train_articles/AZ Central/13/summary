CLOSEIncoming freshman athletes will have an easier time qualifying at Division I or II colleges, after the NCAA on Friday waived the standardized test scores because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Seniors still needing the test scores to qualify weren't able to take the tests in March and this month, because those opportunities to take the tests were being pushed back by the pandemic that caused schools across the nation to close.
ESPN reported that student-athletes now can qualify to play in Division I by having a 2.3 cumulative grade-point average in 10 core courses that are approved by the NCAA.
Chandler Hamilton football coach Mike Zdebski said one Division I college football coach told, "it changes nothing."
Scottsdale Saguaro football coach Jason Mohns said that the NCAA's waiver could open the door for some of the borderline qualifier kids.
