In the first move of its kind in Arizona, the Navajo Nation announced on April 6 a 57-hour curfew over Easter weekend to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez announced the tribe's plans to extend its curfew on Tuesday during a live online town hall.
Aside from essential employees with official identification and people with emergencies, Navajo Nation residents were ordered to stay home over the weekend.
On Tuesday, the Navajo Nation reported 838 known COVID-19 cases â€” an increase of 25 positive cases since Monday.
The Navajo Area Indian Health Service this week was implementing rapid COVID-19 testing that would produce quicker results, according to a press release from the Navajo Nation.
