The small cohort of living Arizona governors got a little smaller last week when Gov. Jane Dee Hull died at age 84. But four are still alive.

Hull was the first woman elected governor of Arizona, but she did not seek out the national political stage. Some of her colleagues did, or the national political stage sought them.

Here is where they are today:

Bruce Babbitt (1978-1987)

Born in 1938 to a Flagstaff ranching family with a political pedigree, Bruce Babbitt worked as a natural resources lawyer and was attorney general when Gov. Wesley Bolin died in office in 1978. He took Bolin’s place and won the office later that year, as well as a second full term in 1982.

He created the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and, after an unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, was named U.S. Secretary of the Interior by President Bill Clinton.

He joined the law firm Latham & Watkins and works with conservation groups like the League of Conservation Voters and World Wildlife Fund.

Babbitt continues to be outspoken and involved in environmental issues in Arizona and around the world.

Fife Symington (1991-1997)

Hull became governor after a jury convicted Fife Symington in federal court of bank fraud charges and he resigned in 1997. The convictions were later overturned. Before the government could retry him, Symington was pardoned in January 2001 by President Bill Clinton.

Elected in an unprecedented runoff in 1991, Symington, a Republican, had pledged to make government operate as efficiently as a business. He approved the first compacts with Native American tribes to operate casinos in the state, pushed for harsher sentencing laws and signed legislation allowing charter schools.

Symington, who was born in 1945, reinvented himself in the culinary world, opening a school, serving as a pastry chef and launching a Scottsdale restaurant. He toyed with the idea of returning to politics and remains involved in a consulting business.

Janet Napolitano (2003-2009)

Janet Napolitano, born in 1957, was one of the “Fab Five” from Hull’s time as governor – the group of women who were elected in 1998 to the top offices in Arizona government.

A lawyer who first gained national attention as co-counsel for Anita Hill, she served as U.S. Attorney for Arizona and later as state attorney general from 1998 to 2002. The Democrat succeeded Hull as governor, winning the office in 2002. Presiding during an economic boom, she expanded all-day kindergarten to every public school in the state and increased teacher pay.

She acquiesced to Republicans in other areas, though, in approving tax cuts and stricter laws against hiring undocumented immigrants. She resigned in 2009 to join President Barack Obama’s cabinet as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Napolitano went on to become president of the University of California system in 2013, a position she still holds. She anticipated stepping down from the post in August 2020 and later teaching at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, where she is a tenured professor.

Jan Brewer (2009-2015)

A longtime Glendale resident, Jan Brewer has been active in Arizona politics since the 1980s. Born in 1944, she served stints in the state House and state Senate in the 1980s and 1990s. She also was a Maricopa County supervisor from 1997 to 2003 and then was elected secretary of state, taking office in 2003. When Napolitano left office to join the Obama administration in 2009, Brewer succeeded her as governor.

Brewer vaulted into the national spotlight in April 2010, when she signed SB 1070, considered the toughest immigration enforcement law in the nation at the time. Denounced by civil rights groups, she won a full term as governor later that year. She later oversaw the expansion of Medicaid in the state.

Brewer remains a regular political commentator.
