Hundreds of employees in U.S. test positive for new coronavirusA South Dakota meatpacking plant made national headlines Sunday as health officials announced 238 of its employees tested positive for COVID-19.
JBS USA's announcement that it would close two plants indefinitely came after Colorado's governor on Friday ordered the company's plant in Greeley to close through Wednesday.
Dozens of employees there tested positive for the new coronavirus and at least two died.
Federal investigators with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2017 found the Tolleson plant had "egregious" and "inhumane" livestock conditions.
