CLOSE With an increased need and less help, both because of the new coronavirus pandemic, United Food Bank volunteers prepare emergency food bags.
Bader has been a longtime donor to the food bank, but when the COVID-19 crisis erupted, she knew she had to do more.
"With this, you get that really good feeling because you're working with really good people — we're all here for the same reasons — and doing something for somebody who needs it."
But before the volunteers can start, a food bank employee holds a digital thermometer to their temples to make sure no one has a fever.
In February, before the state began lockdowns, about 550 families a week showed up at United Food Bank each Friday, when food boxes are distributed to the public.
