Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,700, with 122 known deaths, according to new numbers released Monday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.

Arizona's total identified cases rose to 3,702, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 163 confirmed cases, or 4.6%, since Sunday when the state reported 3,539 identified cases and 115 deaths.

Maricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,000. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.

More detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was released by the state at noon Sunday.

The number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.

As of Monday morning, the state reported death totals from the following counties: 52 in Maricopa, 29 in Pima, 21 in Coconino, eight in Navajo, four in Pinal and four in Apache.

Mohave County reported two deaths, and Yavapai, Yuma and La Paz reported one each, as of Sunday. Information on deaths in those counties differed on the state site early Monday, showing fewer than three deaths for Mohave and La Paz and zero deaths for Yuma.

As of Monday's state data, 62% of deaths were men and 38% were women. Eighty-four of the 122 total deaths were individuals older than age 65. While race/ethnicity is unknown for 49% of deaths, 25% of deaths were white, 15% were Native American and 7% were Hispanic or Latino.

The state Health Department website said both state and private laboratories have completed a total of 43,347 tests for COVID-19, according to the number posted Sunday on the agency website.

The distribution of cases appears to align with the number of tests done. For instance, the age group with the highest percentage of cases, those aged 20 to 44, also is the age group that was most tested.

Most COVID-19 tests come back negative, the state's dashboard shows, with 8% of tests coming back positive. Of the statewide identified cases, 47% are men and 53% are women. Previously, the majority of cases were men.

While the state's dashboard shows Maricopa County with 2,020 cases, the county's dashboard shows 2,019. Maricopa County’s Department of Public Health provided more detailed information on its 2,019 cases:

Confirmed cases increased by 62 from Sunday to Monday. Deaths increased by four, to 52.

The cases are 50% men and 50% women.

169 cases have been linked to long-term care facilities. Of those, 32% have been hospitalized and 14% have died.

Thirty long-term care facilities have at least one positive case.

Fifty-four people under age 19 have tested positive.

People aged 20 to 44 make up 39% of positive cases, followed by people 45-64 years old at 34% and people 65 or older at 24%.

19%, or 391 cases, have been hospitalized.

6%, or 125 cases, have been in the intensive care unit. The hospitalization and ICU numbers include any cases that were in the hospital or ICU at any time during their illness, the county says.

The likelihood of being hospitalized or in the ICU increases with age. Of those aged 20-44, 73 were hospitalized and 19 were in the ICU. For people aged 45-64, 138 were hospitalized and 47 were in the ICU. Among those over age 65, there were 179 hospitalized and 59 in the ICU.

Of the 52 deaths in Maricopa County, 11 were aged 45-64 and 41 were over age 65.

Cases rise in other counties

According to Monday's state update, Pima County reported 668 identified cases. Navajo County reported 345 cases, while Coconino reported 253. Pinal County reported 168, Apache County reported 89, Yavapai County reported 65, Mohave County reported 40 and Yuma County reported 17 (county officials reported 20).

Cochise County reported 16 cases, Santa Cruz County reported 10, La Paz County reported four, Gila County reported three, and Graham County and Greenlee County each reported two, according to state numbers.

All counties but La Paz, Gila, Graham and Greenlee saw an increase in their numbers from Sunday.

The Navajo Nation had 813 known COVID-19 cases as of Monday evening — an increase of 115 positive cases over the last two days, a press release said. There were 28 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths, according to the press release.

The Navajo Nation had not publicly updated its number of known COVID-19 cases since Saturday because the tribe's epidemiology team spent the Easter holiday with their families. Monday's data included cases not reported by the tribe on Sunday, officials said.

9 cases in Arizona prisons

The Arizona Department of Corrections said nine inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday, up eight from Sunday evening. The nine cases are at the following four facilities: three in Eyman, three in Marana, two in Florence and one in Tucson.

The department has tested 77 inmates as of Monday, with 64 negative cases and four pending out of a total population of over 41,500.

Both legal and nonlegal visitations have been suspended through May 13, at which point the department will reassess the situation. The department said CenturyLink is giving inmates two additional 15-minute calls for free during each each week visitation is restricted.

Maricopa County jails, with a population of 5,500, reported no confirmed positive cases, with 28 tested, 21 negative and seven pending as of Friday.
