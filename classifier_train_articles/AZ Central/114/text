Police are asking for the public's help in identifying a man suspected of molesting children in grocery stores throughout Glendale.

Glendale officials said the man assaulted at least three children inside grocery stores along Bethany Home Road between 58th and 67th Avenues between August and February.

The man approached the children when they were alone with a handshake before pulling their hand toward his body, placing their hands on his genitals, according to police. The victims were between 13 and 15 years old.

Victims and witnesses described the man as Hispanic with a light complexion or Caucasian with a dark complexion, between 30 to 40 years old, standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and approximately 200 pounds with short black hair that appeared to possibly be thinning. Witnesses described his nose as distinctively curved down like a “bird’s beak” and a scar across the bridge.

Anyone with any information should call police at 623-930-3000 or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS or 480-TESTIGO.
