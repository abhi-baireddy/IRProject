Glendale officials said the man assaulted at least three children inside grocery stores along Bethany Home Road between 58th and 67th Avenues between August and February.
The man approached the children when they were alone with a handshake before pulling their hand toward his body, placing their hands on his genitals, according to police.
Witnesses described his nose as distinctively curved down like a “bird’s beak” and a scar across the bridge.
