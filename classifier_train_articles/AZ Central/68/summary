Deputies were called to a neighborhood at the east end of Burris Lane for reports of a stolen dump truck stuck in the mud on Sunday, sheriff's officials posted on Facebook.
The driver, later identified as 27-year-old Tyler Littlefield, did not follow deputies' commands to get out of the dump truck, according to the sheriff's officials.
Sheriff's officials say Littlefield is suspected of breaking into a Flagstaff landscape company and taking the truck to Gray Mountain, where he is accused of taking items from a convenience store, according to sheriff's officials.
Littlefield was booked into a Coconino County jail on suspicion of vehicle theft, possession of stolen property, criminal damage, second-degree trespassing and resisting arrest, officials said.
