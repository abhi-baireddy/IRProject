A Flagstaff man was arrested after reportedly refusing to leave a stolen dump truck earlier this week, Coconino County sheriff's officials revealed on Tuesday evening.

Deputies were called to a neighborhood at the east end of Burris Lane for reports of a stolen dump truck stuck in the mud on Sunday, sheriff's officials posted on Facebook.

The driver, later identified as 27-year-old Tyler Littlefield, did not follow deputies' commands to get out of the dump truck, according to the sheriff's officials.

Negotiations continued for about an hour, until Littlefield finally left the vehicle and was taken into custody.

Sheriff's officials say Littlefield is suspected of breaking into a Flagstaff landscape company and taking the truck to Gray Mountain, where he is accused of taking items from a convenience store, according to sheriff's officials.

On the way back to Flagstaff, the truck was said to be driving erratically and traveled through some driveways and yards on Burris Lane, causing damage in deep mud.

The incident remains under investigation.

Littlefield was booked into a Coconino County jail on suspicion of vehicle theft, possession of stolen property, criminal damage, second-degree trespassing and resisting arrest, officials said.
