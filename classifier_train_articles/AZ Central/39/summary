To support the truck drivers during the pandemic, the Arizona Department of Transportation reopened two rest stops in northern Arizona.
The Park Rest Area along Interstate 40, just west of Flagstaff, and Christensen Park Rest Area along Interstate 17, which is just south of Flagstaff, are now both open to drivers.
The Park Rest Area closed in 2009 and Christensen Park Rest Area closed in 2002.
Before the pandemic, Bradley said the Arizona Trucking Association and ADOT were studying the lack of parking spots for truck drivers.
