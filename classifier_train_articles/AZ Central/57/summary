Much of the Valley will see temperatures in the mid-80s starting Sunday and lasting through Tuesday, according to Paul Iñiguez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.
With 90s in the forecast next week, here is a look at some stats regarding the first 90°F, 95°F, & 100°F day for Phoenix & Yuma.
If 90°F is reached or exceeded on Wed, it will be the 10th latest for Phoenix & 4th latest for Yuma!
Phoenix typically hits the first 100-degree day as early as May 2.
"If you're going to be outdoors, try not to spend a lot of time outside during the hottest parts of the day," Iñiguez said.
