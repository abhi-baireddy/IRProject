CLOSEArizonans should be wearing cloth face coverings — masks — when they go out in public, the state's health director said Wednesday.
The advice follows recently updated guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and reverses a previous recommendation that wearing face masks would not prevent the spread of COVID-19, which is caused by the new coronavirus.
Anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance also should not wear one, public health officials say.
But to use a face covering ethically, save the medical-grade masks for health care workers.
