The Winslow Police Department said Daniel J. Mazon, 71, was cited on April 11 on suspicion of operating a business in violation of an emergency decree.
The police department referred to the business as an "Authentic Indian Arts Store," at 91 Hipkoe Drive in Winslow.
"The owner insisted he was now considered a 'department store' as he stood behind the jewelry counter," police said.
Although people can be charged, "law enforcement agencies must take care to maintain constitutional safeguards that exist to protect individual rights and fundamental liberties," the opinion said.
"Despite this unfortunate situation, no business owner has been arrested and the City is by no means operating as a police state," Barkley said in a statement.
