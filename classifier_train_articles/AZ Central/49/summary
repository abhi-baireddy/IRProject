Two Arizona governors in less than a decade had left office under clouds of controversy when Jane Dee Hull rose to power in 1997.
The Hull family has not finalized plans for services in light of current public health concerns.
She taught elementary school while her husband, an obstetrician, worked in public health.
She was elected to the Arizona House in 1978 and quickly became a voice for conservative members.
