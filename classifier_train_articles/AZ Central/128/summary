As Americans prepare for the traditional Thanksgiving feast Thursday, federal food and health officials have issued warnings about potential bacteria contamination of turkey and romaine lettuce.
Turkey and salmonella concernsA turkey salmonella outbreak, potentially spread throughout the entire processing industry, has led health officials to advise extra caution to prevent food poisoning as cooks prepare the Thanksgiving turkey.
That has led them to say the strain involved may be widespread throughout the turkey industry including ground turkey, turkey patties and full turkeys.
Romaine lettuce E. coli warningThe CDC on Tuesday also warned the public not to eat any Romaine lettuce – and retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve it – over concerns of an E. coli outbreak.
