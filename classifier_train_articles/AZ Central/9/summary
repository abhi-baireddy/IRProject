Of the university's 15,000 employees, the majority will be affected by the furloughs or pay cuts, UA spokeswoman Pam Scott said in an email.
â€œThe board sincerely appreciates the dedication and commitment of all University of Arizona employees who will endure the financial hardship of the furlough and pay cuts.
The Republic has reached out to Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University to see if either is planning furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs.
ASU spokeswoman Katie Paquet said, "We do not have plans for furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs at this time and are still working through all financial implications for the university."
No furloughs or pay cuts were announced in the email.
