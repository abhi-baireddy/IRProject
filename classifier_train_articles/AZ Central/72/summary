CLOSE Skyline High School seniors picked up their caps and gowns at the school Tuesday, knowing they will likely not get to wear them at an actual ceremony.
Arizona RepublicThe green cap and gown that 18-year-old Shelbie Rash intended on wearing to her graduation from Skyline High School in Mesa in May is the same one her four older siblings donned for their commencements.
"We won't sugarcoat anything – it really, really sucks – but it's been really nice to watch the class of 2020 really band together and spread so much positivity, especially through social media," Rash said.
The administrators chatted with students through their windows as they waited in line to get some of the final relics of their high school careers.
Ayden Clytus, 17, picked up her cap and gown on Tuesday and said it's been "weird" to experience high school milestones without the pomp and circumstance that would normally accompany them.
