Allen was sentenced to death for the 2011 murder of 10-year-old Ame Deal.
John Allen and his wife were both convicted of first-degree murder and child abuse charges in 2017.
Ame's aunt and legal guardian, Cynthia Stoltzman, is serving 24 years for child abuse while Ame's father, David Deal, is serving 14 years for child abuse.
Court documents say Allen and the other family members in the house often used harsh punishments on Ame Deal for minor infractions.
Although the court upheld his death sentence, the decision also vacated Allen's sentences on conspiracy to commit child abuse, intentional child abuse and reckless child abuse, and remanded them to trial court for resentencing.
