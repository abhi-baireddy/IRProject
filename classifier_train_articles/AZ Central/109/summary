CLOSEAndi Fourlis (Photo: Mesa Public Schools)Arizona's largest school district has a new superintendent.
The Mesa Public Schools governing board has selected Andi Fourlis, currently the district's deputy superintendent, to replace Ember Conley.
Before that, she worked for the Arizona Science Center for two years and the Scottsdale Unified School District for 19 years.
The school board whittled the search down to three this month and interviewed candidates during a livestream.
But when she learned the payments were not approved by the school board, she returned the money.
