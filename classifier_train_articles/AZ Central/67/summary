(Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic)After nearing extinction, a controversial reintroduction to the wild and a string of shootings, controversies and lawsuits, the Mexican gray wolf awaits the next chapter of its story.
The Mexican wolf was placed on the Endangered Species List in 1976 after being exterminated to the brink of extinction.
The last seven gray wolves were captured, and a captive breeding program initiated.
Currently, about 300 gray wolves live in captivity in addition to 163 canids living in the wild in Arizona and New Mexico.
