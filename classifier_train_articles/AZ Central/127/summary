CLOSENearly 500 temporary city employees in Tempe were furloughed on Monday in anticipation of the financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 495 employees will be furloughed until city operations return to normal, according to the city.
Staff was preparing to propose its largest budget for capital projects ever, at about $800 million.
Longer term, city staffers look to scale back on capital projects and stow away cash.
The council, which began meeting remotely in March, will discuss the operating and capital budget at a work session scheduled for 4 p.m. April 22.
