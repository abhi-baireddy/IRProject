Doug Ducey allowed food trucks to operate at some state rest areas.
Ducey issued an executive order Wednesday help long-haul truck drivers by allowing the food trucks to work at eight Arizona Department of Transportation rest areas in the state.
While restrictions and social distancing guidelines due to coronavirus are still in effect, truck drivers continue to go to work.
The permit allows food trucks to operate at rest areas from 30 minutes prior to sunrise until 30 minutes after sunset.
ADOT recently opened two rest areas in northern Arizona for truck drivers to support the trucking industry.
