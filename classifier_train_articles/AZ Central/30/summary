Arizona hospitals aren't citing any shortages yet, but community members across the state are preparing for the possibility by sewing homemade masks and providing the materials for others to participate.
The initiative aims to provide materials to community members with sewing machines who are willing to sew homemade masks for caregivers.
Threaded Together, a nonprofit organization in Flagstaff, donated homemade face masks to the Salvation Army Flagstaff.
However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises that healthcare professionals may use them as a "last resort" when surgical face masks are not available.
