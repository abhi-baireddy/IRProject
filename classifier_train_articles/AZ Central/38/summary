CLOSEAs the Navajo Nation escalates its fight against an outbreak of COVID-19, five Navajo Police Department employees have tested positive for the new coronavirus, officials told The Arizona Republic on Tuesday.
"As the numbers of positive cases increase across the Navajo Nation, so does our risk of being exposed," he continued.
The names and roles of the department's employees would not be released to protect their privacy, the department initially said.
During a live online town hall on Tuesday, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez referred to the department's first two COVID-19 positive employees as officers.
On Monday evening, the Navajo Nation reported 813 known cases of COVID-19 and 28 deaths related to the virus.
