While the coronavirus pandemic closed Disney's parks last month, the company is sticking with its policy of not issuing ticket refunds.

The iconic Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California has been closed since March 14 and does not have a reopening date.

The good news: Once the park reopens, Disneyland's nonrefundable single-day and multi-day tickets can be used for a future visit through the end of their validity period, according to the park's website.

Promotional tickets for Southern California residents will be extended on a day-to-day basis for each day the park is closed.

The expiration date for promotional child tickets will be extended to Dec. 15, 2020, or 13 days after the ticket's first use, whichever comes first.

Military Salute tickets expire on Dec. 18, 2020, and can be used on non-consecutive days.

Walt Disney World resort tickets in Florida are also not refundable, but can be used on any date through Dec. 15, 2020. Tickets that have not been used by that date can be used toward the purchase of a future ticket.
