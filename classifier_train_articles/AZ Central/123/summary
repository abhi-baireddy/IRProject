But the county Sheriff's Office Department said its investigation of Sarah Galloway's death is continuing.
The woman with Down syndrome had been missing since March 2019 and was last seen at her home in Picture Rocks.
Her family held a candlelight vigil in April 2019 with the hope that Galloway would be found alive.
On Feb. 12, a hiker found two leg bones in a desert area near Galloway's home on the outskirts of metro Tucson.
