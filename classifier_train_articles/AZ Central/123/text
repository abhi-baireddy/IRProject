The cause and manner of death of a 38-year-old woman whose skeletal remains were found in February can't be determined, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.

But the county Sheriff's Office Department said its investigation of Sarah Galloway's death is continuing.

The woman with Down syndrome had been missing since March 2019 and was last seen at her home in Picture Rocks.

More than 100 volunteers and several law enforcement agencies searched for Galloway.

Her family held a candlelight vigil in April 2019 with the hope that Galloway would be found alive.

On Feb. 12, a hiker found two leg bones in a desert area near Galloway's home on the outskirts of metro Tucson.

Authorities said dental records were used to positively identify the remains as those of Galloway.
