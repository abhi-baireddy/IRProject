CLOSEA bald eagle nest in a saguaro cactus, the first time such a scene has ever been documented.

For 18 years, per Koloszarâ€™s advice, Jacobson has kept an eye out for bald eagles nesting in saguaros.
While there have been confirmed sightings of bald eagles nesting in the similarly columnar Cardon and Hecho cactuses in Mexico, biologists have been searching for a pair of bald eagles nesting in an Arizona saguaro for decades without success.
