A suspected human smuggler was seen on a border camera lifting small children over a border fence near Yuma Monday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.

Yuma Sector surveillance cameras captured an unidentified person helping a family of six undocumented people over the 18-foot border wall near the San Luis Port of Entry, which is south of Yuma at the Arizona-Mexico line, the agency said.

The family surrendered to Customs and Border Protection agents who arrived on the scene and were taken into custody, officials said in a statement.

The family of six included three children: a 2-year-old, a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old, the agency said.

The two young children were seen on a video being dropped from over the wall to the older members of the family by an unidentified individual, Customs and Border Protection said.

One child suffered a facial injury and was treated by agents.

The individual assisting the family over the wall returned to Mexico and was not apprehended, officials said.

According to Customs and Border Protection, the section of wall is part of 27 miles in Yuma Sectorâ€™s area of responsibility, which has been selected and funded for wall replacement.
