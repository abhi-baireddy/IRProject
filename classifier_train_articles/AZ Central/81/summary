The closure comes after the South Dakota Department of Health said 238 of Minnehaha County's 438 COVID-19 cases involve "individuals who work at Smithfield Foods."
The plant, one of the nation's largest pork processing plants, was identified as the state's largest hot spot accounting for about 38% of its cases.
TenHaken said the decision to call for closure at Smithfield Foods came after confirmed COVID-19 cases among plant workers spiked for a third consecutive day.
The Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant accounts for 4% to 5% of the nation's pork production, the company says.
