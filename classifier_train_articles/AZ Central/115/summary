Thirty-two people have been sickened and 13 hospitalized because of contaminated food likely linked to romaine lettuce, the FDA said.
Among the reasons romaine lettuce is vulnerable is it has no protective rind and generally is eaten raw, food safety experts and academics said.
Those incidents of E. coli were tied to leafy greens in the U.S. and romaine lettuce in Canada.
