After about 50 years in business, the Prescott Valley Motel at 8390 State Route 69 closed in 2018.
Bids for the Prescott Valley Motel have gone above $1,000 as of Feb. 21.
â€œWe are aware of the historical significance of the old Prescott Valley Motel sign," Circle K said in a statement to The Arizona Republic.
It is not financially feasible for Circle K to rehabilitate the motel sign, Russell said, because of its condition and that it doesn't comply with current codes.
The Arizona Preservation Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy organization, has also looked into the possibility of saving the motel sign.
