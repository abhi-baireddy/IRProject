The coronavirus triggers an immune system overreaction of inflammation, tissue damage and too much fluid in the lungs.
After white blood cells join the fight, they also release cytokines to signal other immune cells to come help.
Typically, this is a good response, because it allows immune cells from the blood to go into an infected area.
Normally, this reaction is temporary because other immune cells called B cells and killer T cells respond to the call for help and start the second phase of the immune system response.
Another vulnerability in the immune system of older people is that with age, immune cells seem to have a delay in their ability to communicate with one another.
