CLOSE About 6.5 million pounds of beef is being recalled by Arizona-based meat producer JBS Tolleson, INC. Veuer's Natasha Abellard has the story.

The Tolleson facility is operated by Brazilian company JBS S/A's U.S. subsidiary, JBS USA.
Documents show JBS Tolleson took issue with the original federal notice and wrote "we feel that we were operating in a humane fashion."
Some of the recalled beef from the Tolleson business may be frozen and already in consumers' freezers, the FSIS warned.
