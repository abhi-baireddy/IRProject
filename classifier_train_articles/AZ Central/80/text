The sunny skies and pleasant temperatures we’ve been experiencing would be the perfect conditions to get out and explore Arizona under normal circumstances.

But these aren’t normal circumstances.

The new coronavirus pandemic and fears of contracting COVID-19 have most Arizonans hunkering down in their homes. For many, exploring the great outdoors has been reduced to a walk or bike ride around the neighborhood while being careful to stay at least 6 feet from others.

Fortunately, there are virtual options for those who might want to venture a little farther from home while still maintaining social distancing guidelines.

Wildlife cams let you keep an eye on bald eagles near Lake Pleasant, ocean life at Channel Islands National Park in California or brown bears hoping to catch salmon in Alaska.
