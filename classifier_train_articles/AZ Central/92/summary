The CalRecycle gives state residents a chance to earn back a tax added onto the cost of most bottled goods sold in California by recycling them at special recycling centers throughout the state.
California DOJ agents said Bustillos, the owner of Bustillos’ Trucking, operated his business for the sole purpose of smuggling out-of-state containers into California.
Sanchez and Bustillos were extradited to California, according to a news release from the California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery.
This is the first recycling bust across state lines, according to the California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery.
