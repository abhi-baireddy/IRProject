CNN's Christiane Amanpour speaks with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist and author of 'Arguing with Zombies,' about the economic impacts of the coronavirus shutdown.
Krugman said it is "clear" that the U.S. needs to wait to reopen the economy.
"No one's been through this before," Krugman said.
So, but one thing we know for sure the United States is nowhere close to that."
"The idea that we can reopen in a few weeks is crazy," he added.
