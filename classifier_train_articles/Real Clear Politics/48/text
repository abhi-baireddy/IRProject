President Obama endorsed Joe Biden for president in this web video released Tuesday.



He noted Biden’s leadership on health care, climate change, and the 2008 recovery, and said that he believes that Biden is the person who can heal the country in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.



"I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden to be president of the United States," President Obama said. "Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a good friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now."



"Joe was there as we rebuilt from the Great Recession and rescued the American auto industry. He was the one asking what every policy would do for the middle class and everyone striving to get into the middle class," Obama said.



"With President Obama on our team, we’re going to unite our party and restore the soul of the nation. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump," the campaign said.
