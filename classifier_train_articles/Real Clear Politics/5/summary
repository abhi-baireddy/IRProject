Daily White House briefings, and as a result the media and the American public, have been fixated up to now on the response to the pandemic from the administration and Congress.
To create a stronger sense of urgency, the White House should begin devoting more time in its daily briefings to the current status quo and timelines of drug approvals.
Those responsible for getting more masks and ventilators to hospitals feel an appropriate level of pressure because that is where our focus has been.
Federal regulators, especially at the Food and Drug Administration, should feel a similar level of pressure for drug approvals.
The pressure of repeatedly being asked, “Has the trial timeline for this drug changed?” is very good pressure indeed.
