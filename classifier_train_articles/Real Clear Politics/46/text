Thousands of cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles joined an #OperationGridlock protest organized by a conservative group called the Michigan Conservative Coalition Wednesday, blocking streets in Michigan's state capital, Lansing. The march is a demonstration against the state's coronavirus quarantine "Stay Home" order.



"We are all concerned for those afflicted with COVID 19. Yes, many of the personal behaviors we have been reminded to use are good practices. Wash your hands. Cover your cough. Stay home if you are sick," read a note on the group's website. "That said, Michiganders are fed up!"

This #OperationGridlock is looking similar to a Trump rally. There are a lot of MAGA/KAGA attire and flags. pic.twitter.com/zksQJBoWfw — Mikenzie Frost (@MikenzieFrost) April 15, 2020
