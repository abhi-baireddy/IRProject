Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute and author of 'Bully of Asia,' joins Tucker Carlson on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Mosher said China has to answer how the coronavirus began, was it naturally-occurring or did scientists make it in a lab. Mosher suspects any evidence of how the coronavirus was created, whether in a lab or naturally, was destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party



"The question becomes was it a naturally-occurring horseshoe bat coronavirus that was isolated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and then accidentally escaped from the lab by infecting a lab worker. Or was it a virus that the researchers there were working on using gain-of-function technology," Mosher told Carlson.
