ADAM BOEHLER, U.S. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION CEO: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible. Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly with over 100,000 by the end of June. At the same time, there are over 60,000 ventilators in our hospitals right now that are not in use.

Knowing this and at your direction, we reached out to the American Hospital Association to design a system that allows hospitals to lend ventilators to other hospitals right when they need it. Within the past week alone, 20 top health systems have signed up for this dynamic ventilator reserve representing over 4000 ventilators. Not only do we have top academic systems like Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, but we also have top health systems from New York City, New Orleans, Washington state, and California. Over a week ago, these places would have needed help, but now they are here to help.

There's been no American that has needed a ventilator that has not received one. This dynamic virtual reserve combined with our strategic stockpile will ensure that this is always the case. I'd like to thank the president for his leadership and directive to focus on public-private partnerships like this one. I'd also like to thank Sam Hazen from HCA, Lloyd Dean (SP) from Common Spirit for leading this effort with the AHA and the Federation of American Hospitals.

These have been difficult times. A few weeks ago, the vice president came into my office and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies. We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President. This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans. Thank you." />
