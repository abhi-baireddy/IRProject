HBO's "Last Week Tonight" host John Oliver discusses how Coronavirus is impacting the US workforce, from mass unemployment to the problems faced by essential workers.
"Companies who employee essential workers have openly waxed poetic about how much they value them.
Few in more glowing terms than Amazon," he said.
"And while the company claims it’s keeping workers safe by distributing masks and conducting temperature checks, many Amazon workers paint a much different picture, citing ‘an inability to maintain social distancing guidelines, a lack of protective gear and hand sanitizer and lack of time to clean their hands.'
And if you feel you’re not working in safe conditions, it can be even more infuriating to know the items you’re packing can sometimes be anything but essential," he said.
