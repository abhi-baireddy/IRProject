White House counselor Kellyanne Conway laid blame on the World Health Organization for mishandling the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday morning's "FOX & Friends."
She recalled how they originally claimed that shutting down travel between the U.S. and China was "xenophobic and racist."
"We have every right to know because of what’s happened here in this global pandemic, but there’s another reason, some of the scientists and doctors say that there could be other strains later on, this could come back in the fall in a limited way," she said.
"This is COVID-19, not COVID-1 folks, and so you would think the people in charge of the World Health Organization, facts, and figures, would be on top of that," the White House advisor said.
