Sen. Elizabeth Warren endorsed former VP Joe Biden for president on Wednesday, becoming the final major 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to do so following Sen. Bernie Sanders throwing his support to Biden on Monday and former President Obama announcing his public backing of Biden on Tuesday.
"In this moment of crisis, it's more important than ever that the next president restores Americans' faith in good, effective government," Warren said in a video announcement Wednesday morning.
"Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service.
He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods."
And treat you with respect, no matter where youâ€™re coming from," she said about Biden.
