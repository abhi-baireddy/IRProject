The Democratic presidential primary came to an end on Monday as Sen. Bernie Sanders officially endorsed former VP Joe Biden during a live stream event online.



"We are in a terrible moment, an unprecedented moment and I know we share the understand that we have to go forward, right now and out of this, in an unprecedented way to address the terrible pain that so many of our fellow Americans are feeling," Sanders said.



"So, today, I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every Independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse," Sanders said. "To make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and Iâ€™m speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country."
