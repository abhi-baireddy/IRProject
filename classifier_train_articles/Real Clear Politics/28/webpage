REPORTER: He said--sorry. He said, &quot;we need to be the Rosa Parks of government injustices.&quot;

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there is a lot of injustice. When you look at Virginia where they want to take your guns away, they want to violate your second amendment. When you look at I mean look, I am getting along very nicely with the governor of Michigan but she has things don't buy paint, don't buy roses don't my--I mean she's got all of these crazy things. I really believe somebody sitting in their boat in a lake should be okay. They shouldn't arrest people. Some of them are being unreasonable I really believe that. They are being unreasonable but I think Virginia is a great case though because they are using this, they are trying to take your guns away in Virginia and if people in Virginia aren't--aren't careful that's what's going to happen to them so yeah, I mean I could see where he's coming from.
