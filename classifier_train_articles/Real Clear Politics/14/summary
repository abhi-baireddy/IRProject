Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council and a close friend of Laffer’s, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin each followed up with calls to Laffer in subsequent days.
As of Monday morning, Laffer has said he hasn’t been contacted by the Trump administration about serving on the recovery council.
“Every job has a payroll tax — every single one does — little businesses, big businesses, fat businesses, skinny businesses, tall ones, short ones,” he says.
“Few people in history have revolutionized economic theory like Arthur Laffer,” Trump declared during the awards ceremony.
After Bear Stearns had fired him over the addiction, Laffer offered Kudlow a job and a place to live.
