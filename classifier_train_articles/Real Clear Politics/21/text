Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation" that the World Health Organization should issue a report on the Chinese government's failure to report information about the early coronavirus outbreak.



"Had [China] been more truthful with the world, which would have enabled them to be more truthful with themselves, they might have actually been able to contain this entirely. And there is some growing evidence to suggest that as late as January 20, they were still saying that there was no human-to-human transmission and the WHO is validating those claims on January 14, sort of enabling the obfuscation from China."



"I think going forward the WHO needs to commit to an after-action [report] that specifically examines what China did or didn't tell the world and how that stymied the global response to this," Gottlieb said. "I also think they need to embrace Taiwanâ€™s role in the global health community and allow them to attend the World Health Assembly.
