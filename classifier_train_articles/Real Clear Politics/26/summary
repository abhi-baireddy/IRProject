Cotton: CCP's Handling Of COVID-19 Could Be "The Biggest, The Costliest, The Most Deadly Cover-up In The History Of Mankind"Sen. Tom Cotton said on “Fox & Friends” on Friday morning that if circumstantial reports that the coronavirus pandemic originated in a biological research facility in Wuhan turn out to be true, it would be "the biggest, the costliest, the most deadly cover-up in the history of mankind."
SEN. TOM COTTON: The circumstantial evidence, which I began to cite in January, is stacking up pretty quickly that this virus may have originated in those labs in Wuhan.
We knew from the very beginning that the Chinese Communist Party's front story about the food market was probably wrong.
We know that China has a very sloppy history of laboratory safety.
If that's the case, it really is the biggest, the costliest, the most deadly cover up in the history of mankind.
