President Trump said as the lead sponsor of the World Health Organization, the United States has a duty to halt funding until there is full accountability for dangerous and costly decisions made by the group.

Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises.
