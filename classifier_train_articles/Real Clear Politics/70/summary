In an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) discusses whether Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) should remain as chair of Senate Intel during an ethics investigation into insider trading prior to the coronavirus.
"Would you just pass along to him for me, and I believe every Republican who’s listening, and conservative, he needs to step down as head of Intel," Hewitt said.
Your seatmate, Senator Burr, is under investigation for insider trading and now the sale of his Capitol Hill house.
I know that the Ethics Committee, he asked for an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.
TILLIS: Well, regardless of what happens with the investigation, I think Senator Burr owes everybody in North Carolina and the United States an explanation, and we’ll see where the investigation goes.
