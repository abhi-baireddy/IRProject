		<meta name="description" content="In an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) discusses whether Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) should remain as chair of Senate Intel during an ethics investigation into insider trading prior to the coronavirus.

&quot;Would you just pass along to him for me, and I believe every Republican who's listening, and conservative, he needs to step down as head of Intel,&quot; Hewitt said. &quot;I have no confidence in him until this is done. Not the Senate, but I don't want him chairing Intel in a time when we have to have confidence in the findings of that committee regarding the PRC.&quot;

From the interview:

HUGH HEWITT, HOST: Now I'm going to be very hard on the Democrats in this segment, but I want to begin by being hard on the Republicans. Your seatmate, Senator Burr, is under investigation for insider trading and now the sale of his Capitol Hill house. I believe in the Menendez rule. No one has to quit the Senate unless they're convicted, but I also believe he ought to step down as chairman of the Intel Committee. Has there been any conversation with him about that?

SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): I haven't had any conversation with him about it. I know that the Ethics Committee, he asked for an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. I suspect that there is an investigation in the DOJ, and we'll have to see where the facts lead.

HEWITT: Would you just pass along to him for me, and I believe every Republican who's listening, and conservative, he needs to step down as head of Intel. I have no confidence in him until this is done. Not the Senate, but I don't want him chairing Intel in a time when we have to have confidence in the findings of that committee regarding the PRC.

TILLIS: Well, regardless of what happens with the investigation, I think Senator Burr owes everybody in North Carolina and the United States an explanation, and we'll see where the investigation goes. With respect to his chairmanship, that's a decision that he and, that would be better left to him and the leadership." />
