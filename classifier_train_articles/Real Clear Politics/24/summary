Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the reason the U.S. is in a crisis is not because of what China or WHO did, it is because of President Trump not taking the coronavirus seriously.
The fact that the president didn't put in place an effective plan to develop new tests.
He said so on TV and the reason that we're in the crisis that we are today, is not because of anything that China did.
We weren't going to be able to keep every case out of United States, but we didn't need tens of thousands this of people dying.
Early on in this crisis, there was no bigger cheerleader for China and their response to coronavirus than president Donald J. Trump.
