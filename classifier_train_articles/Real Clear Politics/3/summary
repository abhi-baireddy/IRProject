In the interview on the Biden accusations, Ben Smith specifically asked Baquet to justify the Times’ treatment of Kavanaugh.
On Tuesday, progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said it’s “legitimate to talk about” the allegations against Biden.
Most appalling, Baquet also admitted that the Times edited its story on Reade’s allegations at the behest of the Biden campaign.
However, the allegations against Biden, while more credible than the accusations against Kavanaugh, are still far from being definitively proven.
But if Smith led Baquet to water, the Times’ executive editor steadfastly refused to drink.
