Trump said Virginia is using the pandemic to enact gun control legislation and called now a good time to bring up Second Amendment rights.
"Is this the right time to kind of bring in a Second Amendment issue?"
When you look at Virginia where they want to take your guns away, they want to violate your second amendment.
We are entitled to a second amendment and he's trying to take the second amendment, meaning that state is trying to take the Democrats in the state, the Republicans are fighting it.
They are trying to take that--that second amendment, right, but second amendment right away.
