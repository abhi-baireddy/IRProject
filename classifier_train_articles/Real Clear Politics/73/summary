CNN host Anderson Cooper and CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta react to Monday's White House coronavirus task force briefing.
"I think this was a total meltdown the president had in that briefings earlier today," Acosta said.
"One thing we should point out about the video, which looked straight out of Beijing or Pyongyang, there were White House officials working on that video this afternoon.
"Keep in mind the president was trying to defend the actions he took during that lost period, but his words are also important," Acosta said Monday night.
That's something that the president is trying to erase from everybody's memories, but propaganda videos, temper tantrums in the briefing room just won't do that."
