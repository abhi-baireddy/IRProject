		<meta name="description" content="Sen. Rand Paul joined &quot;FOX &amp; Friends&quot; Tuesday morning to discuss the experience of having had coronavirus and how he, a medical doctor, is volunteering at a local hospital. 

SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): In my case, I had an extraordinarily mild case. I had no symptoms. Never had a headache. Never had a body ache. Never had a fever. Never had a cough. I didn't really have any symptoms. In fact, I would have never gone to the hospital had I not -- or not to the hospital, I would not have even gone to the doctor's office had I not known this was about and that I had been traveling so much. 

So it's a bizarre sort of situation that some people get very, very sick, you know, even die from this, and some people get no symptoms. They've tested people in Iceland where they've tested, you know, a large body of the population of Iceland and they found that about 50 percent of the people were positive have no symptoms. And so there's something about this illness that's not just the illness, but your immune response to it. And it may be some sort of genetic thing that some people are genetically predisposed to an overwhelming immune response that ends up making the patient very sick with their lungs filling up with fluid and then other people, like myself, get virtually no symptoms. 

SIEGEL: Senator Paul, I want to ask you something a lot of our viewers don't know about you, and I know you're too humble to say this yourself, but you go around to underserved areas and you perform eye surgery, you're an eye surgeon, an ophthalmologic surgeon, that saves vision for a lot of people. And it's something you do that you don't highlight enough. 

So how does it feel to now volunteer in a COVID-19 war, taking care of patients with COVID-19, after having had it yourself? Does that put you in a better position to address it, to communicate it, to know what they're feeling like? 

PAUL: You know, I spent about 20 years in medicine, mostly doing eye surgery, but I was also an ER physician, as well as someone who spent a year doing general surgery. So I've been in and out of medicine my whole life. 

I miss it. It's great to be back working with local doctors, some of whom I knew when I was in private practice here, but some of whom are new and younger and I've gotten to know some of the hospitalists. When I was in practice, there weren't many hospitalists. These are doctors who practice primarily in the hospital. And that's who I've been working with in the hospital. 

Because I now have immunity, I can't catch it, presumably. I have the ability to go into rooms more often. I have the ability to talk to some of the patients and maybe spend a little more time that anything I can do to prevent a trip of either a doctor or a nurse into the room is helpful to them. 

It's also -- I try to be encouraging to the patient just from a moral standpoint. Some of the patients I've been with, the biggest thing that bothers them is they can't see any family. Their family is not allowed to visit them in the hospital and that's hard on people, young or old." />
