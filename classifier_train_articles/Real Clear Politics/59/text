Mark Levin argued President Trump has more power to open up state economies than people believe and that the Supreme Court precedent has strengthened the executive branch's authority over the states.



"The governors have shut down the economy, not the president," Levin said to FOX News host Sean Hannity. "the governors have put people out of work, not the president. The governors have shut businesses, not the president, and several of them are dragging their feet."



"These states do not have plenary police power when they affect interstate commerce -- $2.2 trillion in federal spending to deal with what they've done. 22 million people filing for unemployment compensation. This has a national 'interstate' effect," Levin argued Thursday night.



"These governors are a little confused," Levin said about federalism. "They think federalism means they have all the power and no accountability, that they can make whatever decisions they want and the rest of us have to pay for it. That's one-way federalism. No such thing exists."
