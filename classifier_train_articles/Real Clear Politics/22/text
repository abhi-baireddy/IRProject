Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Thursday that the U.S. should sanction China, the largest state sponsor of pandemics like it sanctions Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism.



"All of the evidence indicates that they locked their country down to protect their people and they did not tell the world about the true state of play inside of China," Graham told FOX News' Sean Hannity. "Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism; China is the largest state sponsor of pandemics."



"This is the third or fourth pandemic that came out of China," Graham said. "This may have happened, the infection may have happened in a lab but the evidence seems to suggest it was spread at these wet markets. What did we do to Iran that is a bad actor? We sanctioned Iran. What should we do to the largest state sponsor of pandemics in the globe? We should sanction China to change their behavior."
