Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Thursday that the U.S. should sanction China, the largest state sponsor of pandemics like it sanctions Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism.
"Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism; China is the largest state sponsor of pandemics."
"This is the third or fourth pandemic that came out of China," Graham said.
What should we do to the largest state sponsor of pandemics in the globe?
We should sanction China to change their behavior."
