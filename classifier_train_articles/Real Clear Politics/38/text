Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) appeared on the 'TODAY' Show on Wednesday for an interview with Craig Melvin that focused on how she plans to reopen her state amid the coronavirus pandemic. Melvin also asked if she would accept a Vice Presidential bid from Joe Biden.



"I've got my hands full with COVID-19 in the state of Michigan right now," Whitmer said. "I'm not focusing on the national politics at the moment. I think the world of Joe Biden and I'm fortunate to have my name considered along with an incredible group of female leaders across this country. I'm confident no matter who he chooses we're going to have a strong ticket that is really focused on the right things and preparing this country for the challenges that we face."
