President Trump suggested that President Obama "knows something" about Joe Biden that the public does not when asked at Wednesday's coronavirus task force press briefing about why Obama has not endorsed his former vice president.



Bernie Sanders "didn't really drop out," Trump said. "What about his delegates? I mean, he said he's going to keep his delegates. That's a weird deal."



"It does amaze me that President Obama has not supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn’t happened. When is it going to happen?" Trump wondered. "He knows something that you don’t know. That I think I know. But you don’t know."



"I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago, there's something he feels is wrong," he suggested.



"I think I know," the president said.



Obama "has got [to endorse Biden] at some point," Trump also said. "Because he certainly doesn’t want to see me for four more years."
