President Trump suggested that President Obama "knows something" about Joe Biden that the public does not when asked at Wednesday's coronavirus task force press briefing about why Obama has not endorsed his former vice president.
"It does amaze me that President Obama has not supported Sleepy Joe.
"He knows something that you don’t know.
But you don’t know."
"I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago, there's something he feels is wrong," he suggested.
