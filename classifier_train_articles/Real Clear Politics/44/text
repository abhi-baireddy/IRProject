Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," World Health Organization envoy David Nabarro warned that while the coronavirus may not be seasonal like normal influenza, it will "stalk the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine."



"We're not so sure that it will come in waves in the way that influenza does," he said. "We think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses."



"The key in dealing with this virus is for every community to have a kind of defensive shield, to pick cases up as they appear, isolate them and stop outbreaks from developing."



"It is going to be necessary for every single country to have that capacity. And so we’re actually encouraging countries to put that in place now, and that will facilitate releasing lockdowns and prevent further massive outbreaks."
