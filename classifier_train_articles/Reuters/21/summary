PARIS (Reuters) - Paris’ bus stops and metro entrances will be equipped with hand gel dispensers and commuters will likely be obliged to wear face masks to use public transport once coronavirus confinement measures are lifted, according to the city’s mayor.
Asked whether authorities in the broader Paris region should make it compulsory to wear face masks in metros and on commuter trains, Hidalgo said discussions on that were under way.
Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron’s government has faced criticism over a shortage of face masks and testing kits.
The president has said that by May 11, France would be able to test anyone presenting COVID-19 symptoms and give nonprofessional face masks to the public.
Hidalgo added that some streets in Paris could be closed to cars in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown exit.
