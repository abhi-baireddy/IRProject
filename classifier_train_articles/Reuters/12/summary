TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces aligned with Libya’s internationally recognised government said they had advanced on Saturday on Tarhouna, a key support base for their eastern-based rival Khalifa Haftar.
The GNA has depended on military support including drone strikes provided by Turkey, which has stepped up its involvement in Libya’s conflict this year.
LNA officials told Reuters the GNA forces had failed to enter the town and that the offensive, the first since Haftar launched his military bid for Tripoli in early April 2019, had been repelled.
LNA forces control eastern and southern Libya and have been positioned around the outskirts of Tripoli for a year.
The GNA has also been trying to capture al-Watiya airbase, about 125 km (80 miles) southwest of Tripoli and the LNA’s other strategic foothold in Tripoli.
