She said Amazon is likely to show that Microsoft’s scenario was not “technically feasible” as the Pentagon assessed.
The Pentagon added that would give it the “opportunity to reconsider the award decision at issue in light of (Amazon’s) allegations.”Amazon did not immediately comment on Friday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has rejected that there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.
