WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada and the United States have agreed to extend border restrictions for another 30 days to help control the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday.
Trudeau said the agreement is unchanged, and he expected shipments of medical supplies such as masks to continue to cross the border.
Trudeau said Canada would support aboriginal businesses with C$306 million in interest-free loans and nonrepayable contributions.
In total, Ottawa has unveiled C$115 billion ($82.15 billion) in direct spending to help companies and individuals deal with shutdowns.
Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Canada wants to avert opportunistic investors taking advantage of weak company valuations, due to the pandemic.
