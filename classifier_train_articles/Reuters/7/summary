HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum shareholders next month will get their first say on the oil company’s troubled acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum when they vote on issuing shares and warrants to Berkshire Hathaway for helping finance the $38 billion deal.

Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett was too generous.
Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Anadarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend.
Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year.
