It marks the latest swoop by an Asian company on an iconic British brand, after Jaguar Land Rover became part of Tata Motors.
Reuters was first to report that an agreement had been reached, with TVS pledging to revive the British brand which is controlled by Chief Executive Stuart Garner.
Discussions between TVS and accountancy firm BDO - which acted as Norton’s administrator - kicked off earlier this year after the British firm, founded by James Lansdowne Norton in 1898, fell into administration in January.
