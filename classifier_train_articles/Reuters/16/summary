LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Frantic stockpiling has given unfashionable food brands a new lease of life.
Widespread lockdowns sent consumers rushing to hoard humdrum products like PG Tips tea or frozen Hot Pockets.
The shift is forcing chief executives of consumer giants such as Unilever and Nestl√© to rethink their priorities.
Unilever has in recent years filled its shopping bags with upmarket skincare brands and expensive detergent.
While these are arguably affordable luxuries, they are hardly essential, and growth will suffer if consumers tighten their belts.
