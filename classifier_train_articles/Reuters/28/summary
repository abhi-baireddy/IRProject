U.S. President Donald Trump arrives during the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2020.

But he and other senior officials have also referred to it as the “Chinese virus” and in recent days have ramped up their rhetoric.
At the same time, however, White House officials are mindful of the potential backlash if tensions get too heated.
Even Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force who has steered clear of political aspects of Trump’s contentions briefings, questioned China’s data.
