On Saturday, the health ministry said the number of confirmed cases rose by 2,917 to 36,599.
But Bolsonaro said there is no room in the country’s budget to afford those costs.
Campos Neto added that the central bank will issue a formal forecast for Brazil’s economy soon, but that it could take some three more months to be able to formally assess the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the Brazilian economy.
