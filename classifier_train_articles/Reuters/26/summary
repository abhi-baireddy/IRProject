Because of low take-up, UBS and HSBC, which along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) are providing a 4.4 billion euro bridge loan for the purchase, were left with an AMS stake of 7.7% and 7.2% respectively.
Investors, who have been concerned from the outset that AMS might overstretch itself with the planned takeover, reacted with relief to Fridayâ€™s news, boosting AMS shares as much as 11.2% to 10.34 Swiss francs ($10.67).
The Swiss stock exchange notification did not say at what price UBS and HSBC had managed to reduce their stake.
For the rights issue, AMS demanded 9.20 francs per share.
