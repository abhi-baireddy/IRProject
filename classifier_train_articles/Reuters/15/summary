LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon’s purchase of a stake in Deliveroo has been provisionally cleared by Britain’s competition regulator in view of a potentially fatal deterioration in the online food delivery group’s finances because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The regulator said Deliveroo informed it the impact of the pandemic on its business meant it would fail financially and exit the market without the Amazon investment.
He said Deliveroo’s demise could leave some customers cut off from online food delivery and others facing higher prices or a reduction in service quality.
“Faced with that stark outcome, we feel the best course of action is to provisionally clear Amazon’s investment in Deliveroo,” he said.
“We’re committed to this investment,” Amazon said in a statement.
