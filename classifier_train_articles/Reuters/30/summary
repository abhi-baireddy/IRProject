(Reuters) - Americans are paying the price for President Donald Trump’s failure to hold China to account over the coronavirus pandemic, presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said on Friday, as the two campaigns spar over who can better confront challenges posed by Beijing.
“The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic.
“Trump trusted China, sent China our supplies, and just look at the mess we’re in now,” it said.
Trump’s campaign responded to Biden’s video with its own, condemning the former vice president for objecting to Trump’s late-January order restricting non-U.S. travelers from China to combat COVID-19.
Biden is actively considering people who would fill key posts, including those related to China and foreign policy, if he is elected president.
