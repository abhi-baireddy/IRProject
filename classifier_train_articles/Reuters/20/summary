REUTERS/Yuri GripasOver the past few days, Washington-based bank groups have given the Fed feedback on the terms of the Main Street Lending Program designed to help mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
As part of that program, banks will make loans to eligible small and medium-sized businesses and the Fed will then purchase 95% of the loan via a special-purpose vehicle.
On Friday, Reuters reported that some funds from a separate program to cover small businesses’ payroll appeared to have gone to some states and companies in less need of the cash.
Otherwise, Main Street businesses and community banks will not participate,” the ICBA wrote in a letter published on Friday.
The Fed, which received roughly 2,000 letters on the program, declined to comment.
