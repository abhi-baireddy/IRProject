TBILISI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Christian parishioners went to churches in ex-Soviet Georgia to attend Orthodox Easter Vigil despite a state of emergency and calls from the government and doctors to stay home amid outbreak of the coronavirus.

Crowds were unusually small everywhere compared to the tens of thousands who normally attend this service every year.
The Georgian Orthodox Church Patriarchy said earlier this month that all Easter services would be held in a traditional manner, but parishioners would be required to maintain social distancing between each other to stem transmission of the virus.
Government officials and doctors have pleaded with citizens to refrain from mass gatherings and to stay at home during Easter celebrations.
