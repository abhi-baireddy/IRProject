When the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close this spring, it exposed the California Legislature’s lack of wisdom in approving a two-year moratorium on the expansion of distance learning in charter public schools.
California continues to lag behind in the use of technology and lag the nation in academic outcomes, particularly educating students in poverty and English learners.
It didn’t help last year, when the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 1505, a bill severely restricting growth of charter schools and distance learning.
In late April 1991, the Richmond Unified School District announced it lacked funds to complete the final six weeks of school.
It’s sad it took a pandemic to move California, the home of Silicon Valley, from 19th century education delivery.
