Growers say they'd rather see the feds fund food banks and others so they can buy their food.
But California growers aren’t thrilled: They say it won’t help them much with their financial crisis.
In California, H-2A workers earn $14.77 an hour this year, or about $118.16 for an eight-hour day, one of the highest in the country for these workers.
Yet the Trump administration’s Department of Agriculture is exploring cutting H-2A worker pay, according to an NPR report.
Union officials say a pay cut for the temporary visa workers may reduce the pay of domestic workers, too, because the H-2A pay rate is considered the average pay for all farmworkers.
