As public health officials implement safety measures against the coronavirus pandemic, governors in states like New York, California and Washington have taken the lead, often looking to Europe and Asia for inspiration on the design of stay-at-home orders and other policies to “flatten the curve” of infection.
From a public health standpoint, this is a bad idea and should not be emulated by U.S. officials.
Every year about a million Americans are hospitalized for heart failure and one out of every five of these patients is admitted to an intensive care unit.
Under normal circumstances, roughly 11 million Americans actively use their gym membership.
Naturally, there may be locations and circumstances, such as public bike share programs, in which cycling should be controlled or even disallowed.
