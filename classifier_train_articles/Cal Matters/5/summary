Now, with the coronavirus emptying campuses and rallies impractical due to social distancing, graduate students are figuring out how to take their movement online.
UC Santa Cruz had been spending heavily to police the picket line, where 17 students were arrested in February.
But strikers’ demand for a $1,412 per month pay increase to cover the rising cost of living resonated with other UC graduate students.
UC has declined to bargain with the union over a cost of living adjustment, though UC Santa Cruz now offers graduate students a $2,500 need-based housing-grant.
A subreddit dedicated to UC Santa Cruz students against COLA is filled with stories detailing students’ frustration with the protests’ effect on classes and research.
