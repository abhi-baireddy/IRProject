The state is facing mounting pressure to enforce parity laws that are supposed to guarantee equal care for physical and mental health issues — with a spotlight this week on mental health care problems at health giant Kaiser Permanente.
This week, Kaiser mental health clinicians are on a five-day strike, protesting long patient wait times and strenuous working conditions for providers.
Frustration with access to mental health services at Kaiser extends beyond the HMO as well.
“Access to behavioral health care services is a very high priority for our governor and for the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Agency,” she said.
“The department has been working hard to ensure health plans comply with all requirements regarding timely access to care and federal and state mental health law — parity laws.”Critics are unconvinced.
