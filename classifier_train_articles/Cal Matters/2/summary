But what happens when the ability of farmers to feed the nation is suppressed by policies that inhibit the certainty of domestic food production?
Over the past 30 years, federal and state policies have taken away millions of acre-feet of water used by Valley farmers to produce food and fiber, and have reallocated this water to environmental purposes aimed at producing a rebound of endangered fish species.
Even in years when the state receives above average precipitation, Californiaâ€™s two major water projects, the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, are unable to supply sufficient water to irrigate all of the land historically under cultivation.
This is in addition to the already reduced food production in the San Joaquin Valley directly related to less water allotted to agriculture.
It has led to the expanded need to depend on other countries for our food supply.
