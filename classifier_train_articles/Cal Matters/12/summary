Undocumented entrepreneurs are a growing demographic.
This growth reflects the increasing economic clout that undocumented immigrants in America hold nationwide.
At Immigrants Rising, through our Entrepreneurship Fund, we provide funding to undocumented entrepreneurs who are promoting social change.
But we canâ€™t expect undocumented immigrants, especially those without DACA protections, to wait for these policy changes.
Doing so is a proven win, both for undocumented immigrants and for us all.
