Thom Tillis Thomas (Thom) Roland TillisSenate misses deadline, but talks on loans go on The Hill's Campaign Report: 200 days to Election Day 2020 Democratic challenger outraises Tillis in North Carolina Senate race MORE (R) in the first quarter of 2020 in the Tar Heel State’s closely watched Senate race.
Polling indicates a tight race between Cunningham and Tillis as the contest emerges as a bellwether of the battle for control of the Senate.
The two leading Democratic and Republican super PACs focusing on Senate campaigns doled out a combined $47 million in the final two weeks of March alone into fall advertising reservations in North Carolina.
Nevertheless, Tillis's campaign expressed confidence that it could face down a challenge from Cunningham in such an expensive climate.
The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election handicapper, rates the North Carolina race a “toss-up.”
