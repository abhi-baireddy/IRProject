“We need you in the White House and I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe,” Sanders said during the appearance.
It took Sanders just five days to endorse Biden after he announced the suspension of his campaign last week.
One major Democratic donor said the move by Sanders gives Biden a significant advantage over Clinton.
“I supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like #MedicareForAll, cancelling ALL student debt, & a wealth tax.
“After all the hoopla, he solidified his hold on the primary earlier than Clinton and has a party more unified because of a disliked incumbent.
