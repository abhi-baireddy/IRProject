NEWS THIS MORNING

The stock market liked that news:

Via STAT News's Adam Feurstein and Matthew Herper, an experimental antiviral medicine given to patients in Chicago has resulted in a drop in fever and respiratory symptoms in almost all of the patients who took the drug. https://bit.ly/2XKac5a

The drug: Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The size of the study: "University of Chicago Medicine recruited 125 people with Covid-19 into Gilead's two Phase 3 clinical trials. Of those people, 113 had severe disease. All the patients have been treated with daily infusions of remdesivir."

From the infectious disease specialist who is overseeing the study: "The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We've only had two patients perish."

IN THE WHITE HOUSE

Yesterday -- Ok, ok, I follow:

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden campaign seeks to let Sanders keep his delegates in unusual move Lady Gaga calls WHO chief a 'superstar' McCarthy says he supports incorporating hospital funding into small business aid package MORE told governors yesterday to call their own shots with regards to opening states. https://cnn.it/2Kafu23

In Trump's words: "You are going to call your own shots," Trump reportedly said, according to CNN. "I've gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I've known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you're going to be calling your shots."

And then today -- Oh...:

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

NEXT STEPS IN REOPENING THE ECONOMY

The new normal:

Via The Hill's Brett Samuels, Morgan Chalfant and Reid Wilson, President Trump unveiled a three-phase plan yesterday to reopen parts of the U.S. economy, but is allowing governors to use those guidelines to make their own decisions. https://bit.ly/3anupRf

The gist of the plan: It recommends that states see a reduction in coronavirus cases and flu-like symptoms before starting to ease restrictions. This ensures hospitals will be able to treat all patients without crisis care.

Keep in mind: A robust COVID-19 testing system is necessary for this plan.

Read the full 18-page plan from the White House: https://bit.ly/3esnrxn

BREAKDOWN OF THE THREE PHASES:

Phase One: "The first phase largely urges existing measures to remain in place while allowing certain businesses, such as gyms, to reopen if social distancing is possible."

Phase Two: "The second phase makes recommendations for states and regions with no evidence of a rebound of COVID-19 and that have twice satisfied the initial criteria on cases, hospitals and testing. It urges all vulnerable individuals to shelter in place and encourages others to exercise social distancing in public. In this phase, officials also say that nonessential travel can resume, schools can reopen, and large venues, gyms and bars can operate with social distancing steps in place. Officials recommend that businesses continue to encourage telework when possible and to close common areas where staff may congregate."

Phase Three: "The third phase, which is recommended only for states that have shown no signs of a spike in cases after restrictions are lifted and have satisfied the initial criteria a third time, allows public interactions and visits to nursing homes to resume and lets bars and restaurants expand their capacity. The third phase still encourages individuals to socially distance when possible and limit their time in large gatherings, while allowing employers to resume unrestricted staffing in the workplace."

REACTION FROM SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHARLES SCHUMER (D-N.Y.):

Schumer said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "The plan is a little more measured than what the president said in the past, which is good but there's a key thing missing in all this ... If we don't have a strong, adequate testing regime, we're going to have real trouble," he added. "You have to know who has the illness, who's immune from the illness and who could get the illness before we can determine who can go back to work and who can't." https://bit.ly/2VjgJlY

Via The Hill's Alex Gangitano, "farmers are finding it difficult to sell their products and distributors are struggling to redirect food quickly with restaurants, schools and offices closed. News reports in recent days have been rife with stories about farmers leaving produce to rot in the fields, even as Americans see empty shelves at grocery stores and food banks say they are overwhelmed by requests for assistance."

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden campaign seeks to let Sanders keep his delegates in unusual move GOP online donor platform expanded to state level Overnight Energy: US oil prices hit 18-year-low | Green groups, coal companies attack EPA power plant rollback from both sides | EPA weighs lifting ethanol requirements for oil refiners MORE's getting a lot of advice:

Via The Hill's Amie Parnes, "Joe Biden is being advised by some Democrats to select a running mate with strong economic credentials as the country faces a steep climb out of a coronavirus-fueled recession, according to sources close to the campaign." https://bit.ly/3aiRUL9

What names? *Whisper, whis-Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenBiden campaign seeks to let Sanders keep his delegates in unusual move McConnell rolls out GOP oversight efforts for coronavirus relief package Joe Biden's record on Social Security isn't perfect, but Donald Trump's is far worse MORE (Mass.) or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer-per, whisper*

The plus for Warren: "Warren's area of expertise is the economy; the former Harvard professor first became a national name in politics as the chair of the oversight panel for the federal bailout program from 2008 -- the last time the country went through a recession."

The plus for Whitmer: "Whitmer is now leading her state through the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered businesses and led to 22 million new filings for unemployment."
