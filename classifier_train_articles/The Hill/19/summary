Contact tracing is one of the oldest infectious disease interventions in the book.
Public health departments around the country employ more than 2,000 of these tracers to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and tuberculosis.

But the number of contact tracers could grow as more cases are identified through testing.
Departments are starting to look at who they have on staff who can be moved into contact tracing roles.
