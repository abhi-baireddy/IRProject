The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will issue hefty fines for anyone who shares medical information surrounding the coronavirus that does not align with official statements, according to state news agency WAM.

The measures would impose fines of up to 20,000 dirhams ($5,500) for anyone spreading misinformation or rumors about the virus.

"It is prohibited to publish, republish or circulate false and misleading health-related information or guidelines about or any information that are not officially announced or approved by MOHAP or other health authorities," the news agency reported of the government's directive.

The directive also states that that individuals who spread "information that contradicts with what has been announced, through print, audio, or visual media or through social media, websites" would be subject to fines.

However, it does not specify whether journalists or media professionals could face punishments for spreading false information.

The new rules are in place to attempt to reduce the spread of the virus by minimizing the sharing of misinformation, as the UAE tackles more than 6,300 infections of COVID-19 and 37 deaths, according to Reuters.
