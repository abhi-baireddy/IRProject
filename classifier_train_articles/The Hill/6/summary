A virtual meeting by the Indiana Election Committee was interrupted on Friday by a hacker who proceeded to take over screens with a pornographic video.
According to the Lincoln Journal Star, the man who interrupted the meeting displayed a video of a man masturbating.
"That was sufficiently disturbing," said Paul Okeson, Election Commission chairman, after the image was removed.
Okeson said the pornographic material was only on the screen briefly before officials turned it off.
A viewer of the Zoom bombing wrote on Twitter: "Most exciting Election Commission meeting ever."
