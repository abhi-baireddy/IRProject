Labor’s Workers’ Comp problems are immense based on my experience.
In another case, a Workers’ Comp physician billed the government nearly $6,000 for a prescription medication that costs around $90 at a retail pharmacy.
When I wrote to Labor’s Inspector General about this “wasteful spending,” to again quote Congressman Issa, I received notice the “approved” physician’s Treasury check for $200 had been canceled.
I also have documented cases of Workers’ Comp bureaucrats lying to Members of Congress about their corruption.
To date, Labor’s IG has done very little about all of this “wasteful spending and mismanagement” at Labor.
