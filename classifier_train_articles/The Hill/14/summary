Former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden is requesting an extended residency permit in Russia for three more years.
His lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his permit was due for expiration in April of this year, according to a report by CNN.
In 2017, the Russian government granted an extended residency to him until 2020.
Congress released a report in 2016 that claimed Snowden had been in contact with Russian officials since his arrival to Russia, which Snowden denies.
In September of last year, the American whistleblower said he would return to the U.S. if he could be guaranteed a fair trial.
