Leading tech industry groups on Thursday urged Congress to support efforts to modernize information technology and ward off cybersecurity threats during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Americans move online and networks are put under increasing stress.
Companies that are members of the tech coalitions include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Airbnb, AT&T and Mozilla, along with many leading cybersecurity groups.
The package included $9.1 million in funding to boost the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s cybersecurity agency, along with $200 million to help the Federal Communications Commission boost telehealth services.
But the tech groups said these funds are not enough to fully support the pressure put on networks by a spike in working from home and use of online services.
The tech groups included a list of specific IT issues to be addressed in a future coronavirus spending package.
