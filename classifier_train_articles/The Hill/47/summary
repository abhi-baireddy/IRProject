Biden’s history on Social Security is far from perfect, but he is far better than Donald Trump.
The campaign’s goal was to undermine Social Security by convincing politicians, the media, and the public of the lie that, notwithstanding our being the richest country in the world at the wealthiest moment in history, Social Security is somehow no longer affordable and must be cut.
In sharp contrast to Trump, Biden’s response to the coronavirus crisis is not to attack Social Security.
Thanks to the hard work of many activists, the mainstream Democratic Party position is now to support expanding, not cutting, Social Security.
The two parties – and their respective candidates — are as far apart on Social Security as they have been in many decades.
