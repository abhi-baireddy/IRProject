During a daily coronavirus press conference, Newsom said that in addition to the 11,000 hotel rooms already acquired to house the homeless, the state had reached an agreement with hotel chain Motel 6, which will provide an additional 5,025 hotel rooms at 47 locations in 19 counties across California.
The initial goal was to procure 15,000 rooms for the state's homeless population during the pandemic.
ADVERTISEMENTNewsom said 4,211 homeless Californians have already been provided with hotel rooms, where they can remain safe during the pandemic.
“Homeless Californians are incredibly vulnerable to COVID-19 and often have no option to self-isolate or social distance,” Newsom said in early April.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering 75 percent of the cost of the rooms, while California subsidizes the rest.
