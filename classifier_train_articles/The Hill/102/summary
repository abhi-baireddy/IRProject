Four top Democrats are raising “serious concerns” about the Trump administration not reaching a cost-sharing agreement with South Korea for U.S. troops based there.
Both sides say the administration’s demands have since softened, but a new deal has yet to be reached.
On Friday, Reuters reported that South Korea recently offered to increase its payment by 13 percent from the previous deal, but Trump rejected the offer.
“This could include readiness challenges and place the lives of United States service members, as well as our security interests, at increased risk.
The impasse comes as the United States and South Korea are battling the coronavirus, which has threatened both nations' military readiness by delaying exercises even as North Korea proceeds apace with missile tests.
