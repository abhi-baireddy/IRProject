Images of people swarming beaches in the Jacksonville area went viral on Twitter Saturday, prompting backlash from users on the platform using the hashtag "#FloridaMorons."
Don't forget the social distancing.
The same day, Jacksonville, Fla., Mayor Lenny Curry (R) announced that Duval Countyâ€™s beaches would reopen.
People are encouraged to go on walks or swim and remain six feet or farther apart from one another to maintain social distancing guidelines.
I appreciate your social distancing and responsible behavior as we opened our beaches for walking, swimming, running etc.
