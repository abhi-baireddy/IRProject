The White House has unveiled guidelines that recommend a three-phase approach for states and counties to begin reopening their economies, allowing residents to gradually return to something resembling normal life amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The guidelines defer to states on reopening decisions and do not set a particular timeline for loosening coronavirus restrictions.
But even the White House booklet lays out a number of restrictions that will persist for weeks or months to come.
ADVERTISEMENTPhase two of the White House guidelines calls for all at-risk populations to continue sheltering in place and urges low-risk individuals to avoid gatherings of 50 or more people and maintain physical distance when in public spaces.
The White House plan calls for employers to develop their own plans around how and when to resume business travel.
