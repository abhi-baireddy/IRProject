As the coronavirus pandemic continues to take its toll on American healthcare, the peripheral medical impacts are beginning to come to light.
Voters are reporting an uptick in missing care such as dentist appointments, annual exams, and counseling sessions, amid the coronavirus crisis, a new Hill-HarrisX survey finds.
Mallory Newall, director of research at Ipsos, points to the numbers seen among those who have missed appointments to treat mental health.
In a recent Ipsos-Axios coronavirus tracker, more Americans have reported their emotional wellbeing and mental health situations getting worse over the course of the spread of the disease.
"I want to hone in on that number about people who are not seeking mental health treatment right now," Newall told Hill.TV.
