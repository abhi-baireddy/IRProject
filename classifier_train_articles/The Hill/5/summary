Speaking at a digital fundraiser hosted by Jed Katz, the managing director of Javelin Partners, Biden said he first started putting together a transition team shortly after his string of primary victories on Super Tuesday in early March.
“I promise you that has already begun,” Biden said.
I don’t want it to sound like that, but it has to happen and that’s why the transition team is already being put together.”ADVERTISEMENTThe transition team will play a role in guiding Biden’s appointments to his Cabinet and to lead the government agencies.
The former vice president did not give any indications about who was on the transition team or whom he’s considering for top-level roles within his potential administration.
In the private sector, in the public sector, people who are committed — first and foremost — are thoroughly honorable,” he said.
