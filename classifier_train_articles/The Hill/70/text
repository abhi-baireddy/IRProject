Protesters, led by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, stormed the Michigan Capitol on Wednesday demanding an end to the stay-at-home order, which they claimed was infringing on their personal liberties.

Whitmer said that kind of behavior could result in a resurgence of the disease, which has hit her state particularly hard. As of Thursday evening, Michigan has reported 29,263 cases and 2,093 deaths.

“The thing that I’m concerned most about, and that I think my fellow governors are as well, is a resurgence,” Whitmer said.

“When you see a political rally — that’s what it was yesterday — a political rally where people aren’t wearing masks and they’re in close quarters and they're touching one another, you know that that’s precisely what makes this kind of disease drag out and expose more people.”
