Gretchen Whitmer (D) on Thursday night said the protests that took place in her state Wednesday demanding an end to her stay-at-home order could result in an extension of social distancing measures like it.
Whitmer tells @Maddow that Wednesday's protest at Michigan's Capitol is the “kind of irresponsible action that puts us in this situation where we might have to actually think about extending stay-at-home orders, which is supposedly what they protesting."

Whitmer said that kind of behavior could result in a resurgence of the disease, which has hit her state particularly hard.
“The thing that I’m concerned most about, and that I think my fellow governors are as well, is a resurgence,” Whitmer said.
