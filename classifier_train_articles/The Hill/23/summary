Phil Murphy (D) warned of a “national disaster” without a boost in federal aid to states to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Murphy warned at a press conference Saturday of “historic” levels of layoffs at the state, county and local levels without billions of extra dollars from the federal government.
ADVERTISEMENTThe remarks come amid a fierce partisan battle in Washington over the next coronavirus relief package.
The National Governors Association (NGA) has called on Washington to allocate $500 billion for states as officials scramble for personal protective equipment and other tools to beat back the virus’s spread.
“Congress must appropriate an additional $500 billion specifically for all states and territories to meet the states’ budgetary shortfalls that have resulted from this unprecedented public health crisis.”
