Horowitz chairs the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), a group that includes watchdogs across federal agencies.
ADVERTISEMENT“Unlike any President in modern history, President Trump has engaged in offensive and unjustified attacks against Inspectors General, criticizing them for following the law, and retaliating against them for telling the truth,” the chairs wrote in a Friday letter to Horowitz.
Their letter points to several recent shakeups with inspectors general, including Trump's sudden decision to fire Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Friday, his removal of the top inspector general who was recently assigned to oversee the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package, and the president's attacks against a watchdog at Health and Human Services (HHS).
ADVERTISEMENTThe Democrats said they now are considering legislation that would restrict the removals of IGs to a list of certain "good cause" conditions.
"We are seeking input directly from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency on legislative and other proposals to increase your independence and protect you from retaliation, including but not limited to allowing for the removal of top Inspector General officials only for good cause," the letter states.
