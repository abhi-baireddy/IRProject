MSNBC’s Craig Melvin played a clip of Biden recalling that former President Obama told him there wasn't "a single important issue" they disagreed on.
Asked if Harris fit the same description, Biden replied, “I think so,” but said he had not spoken directly to Harris on the matter.
"I have been focused 100 percent on this pandemic," Harris said when asked if she had spoken recently with Biden.
Pressed by Melvin on whether she would accept if Biden asks her to serve as his vice president, Harris responded, “Obviously I’d be honored to serve with Joe.”Biden has pledged to name a woman as his running mate.
The former vice president has said he is working from a shortlist of six to 10 candidates, including Michigan Gov.
