Former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill died early Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh at the age of 84, his family told The Wall Street Journal.
ADVERTISEMENTHe led the Treasury Department under Bush during his first term in 2001 and 2002.
His 23-month term ended in December 2002 when he was removed from his post, apparently for deviating from Bush’s message on tax cuts.
O’Neill also clashed with Bush officials over his support for making tax cuts conditional on targets for limiting federal debt and stronger efforts to combat climate change.
He began his professional career at the Bureau of the Budget, later the Office of Management and Budget.
