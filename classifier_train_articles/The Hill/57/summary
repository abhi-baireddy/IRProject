WinRed, which was launched in 2019 to try to offset Democrats’ financial windfall through ActBlue, announced Friday that it is teaming up with the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) to expand its platform to all Republican candidates.
“ActBlue had a 15-year head-start, but WinRed is catching up fast, and today’s expansion to state and local campaigns is an exciting step in that direction,” WinRed President Gerrit Lansing said in a press release.
The GOP also faced a number of disappointing defeats in 2018 and 2019 at the state level, losing a handful of governorships and ceding control of the entire Virginia state government to Democrats.
“I know that WinRed will help to close that gap for me and Republicans in every corner of the country.
That’s why I signed up the moment I could, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.”
