THE LOWDOWN: U.S. crude oil prices slipped to a new 18-year low on Friday, ending the week on a decline.
Twenty-two states and various environmental groups have challenged the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, the Trump administration's replacement to the much-litigated Clean Power Plan implemented during the Obama administration.
The legal battle kicked off Friday, as the first round of detailed legal briefs were due to the U.S. Court of Appeals, where environmental groups are urging the court to nix the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule.
In addition to not capping emissions from power plants, the rule limits regulations to things physically connected to power plant operations.
Oil prices hit a new low Friday amid a number of administration efforts to ease financial pressure on the industry.
