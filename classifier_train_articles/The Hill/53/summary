The chair of Wisconsin's state Democratic Party on Monday blasted a U.S. Supreme Court decision that required all absentee ballots be posted by Tuesday to be counted in the state's election.
The five GOP US Supreme Court justices just overruled two lower courts and shut off extended absentee voting in Wisconsin," he tweeted.

Tony Evers (D) previously issued an executive order delaying the primary due to coronavirus concerns, a move which was also reversed by the state's Supreme Court.
