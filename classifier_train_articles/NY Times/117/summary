Just a few weeks ago, China was overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan.
Since then, it has drastically reduced the number of new cases, what is known as flattening the curve.

In the United States and five other countries, the number of known coronavirus cases is still growing rapidly.
Scales are adjusted in each country to make the curve more readable.
