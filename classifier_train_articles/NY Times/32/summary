It’s helpful to have criteria by which cities or states could determine they’re ready.
Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care.
Other cities and states fear that they will approach New York City’s state of crisis.
This is the most immediate bar, and the focus of most public health officials’ attention.
The United States also doesn’t have enough people working in public health in many areas to carry out this task.
