Dr. Marr said based on physics, an aerosol released at a height of about six feet would fall to the ground after 34 minutes.
The findings should not cause the general public to panic, however, because the virus disperses quickly in the air.
He said the aerosols might stay aloft only for about 10 minutes, but Dr. Marr disagreed with that assessment, and said they could stay in the air for three times longer.
She also said that the experimental setup might be less comfortable for the virus than a real-life setting.
The humidity in a heated house is less than 40 percent, “at which the virus might survive even longer,” she said.
