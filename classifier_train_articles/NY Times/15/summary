On Tuesday, at his daily briefing, Mr. Trump was candid about the transactional rationale behind his stance toward China.
Pressed on how he could criticize the World Health Organization for what he called pushing “China’s misinformation,” after he had also lavished praise on Beijing’s purported transparency, he responded, “Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country.”“I’d love to have a good relationship with China,” he added.
On Friday, however, he posited that China must have the most deaths from the coronavirus — the United States does — and later said, “I’m not happy with China.” He repeated the assertion on Saturday, saying that China had many more deaths than it had reported, and that the virus “could have been stopped in China.
The strategy includes efforts to leverage the U.S.-China relationship against Mr. Biden, who Republicans believe is vulnerable because of his comments last year playing down the geopolitical challenge posed by China and the high-paying work that his son, Hunter, has done there.
Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Trump’s warm words for China.
