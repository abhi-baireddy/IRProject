The ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines.
But as Dr. Fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.
It is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.
If that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating.
In the past, some experimental vaccines have produced serious side effects, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can paralyze and kill.
