These recreations recall the work of the artist Nina Katchadourian, whose series “Lavatory Self-Portraits in the Flemish Style” was shot entirely in airplane bathrooms.
They’re part of a larger body of work, called “Seat Assignment,” in which she creates art during commercial flights.
“I was trying to make art under circumstances where art doesn’t seem possible.
It involves a kind of magic trick,” Ms. Katchadourian said.
“The only possibility is to make use of the tools offered by the web while waiting for this nightmare to pass,” he said.
