This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

In places including China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, fierce efforts to contain the virus appear to have reduced the number of new cases.

In the United States, the virus appears to be everywhere, and everyone now wants to know when we are going to be able to leave our homes and reopen the country.

That’s the wrong way to frame it.The better question is: “How will we know when to reopen the country?”

Some cities or states will recover sooner than others. In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

As for a vaccine, clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.
