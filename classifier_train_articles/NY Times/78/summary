This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.
In places including China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, fierce efforts to contain the virus appear to have reduced the number of new cases.
In the United States, the virus appears to be everywhere, and everyone now wants to know when we are going to be able to leave our homes and reopen the country.
As for a vaccine, clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe.
But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.
