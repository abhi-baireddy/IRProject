A delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world.
The coronavirus, as it’s known, has already infected more than 200,000 people in 140 countries.
Because this virus is so new, experts’ understanding of how it spreads is limited.
They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does — and does not — seem to be transmitted.
