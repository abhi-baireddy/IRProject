LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II turns 94 on Tuesday, for the first time in her nearly seven-decade reign her birthday will not be marked by a gun salute — another longstanding ritual lost to the grim siege of the coronavirus.
The queen requested that “no special measures be put in place” for artillery guns to be fired from multiple sites around London, according to Buckingham Palace, because she did not “feel it appropriate in the current circumstances.” She also instructed that flags should not be flown in her honor unless it could be done while observing social distancing restrictions.
Buckingham Palace said the queen, who has sequestered herself at Windsor Castle since mid-March, did not plan to mark her birthday “in any special way.” She might speak to members of the royal family, who are scattered across the country, by video call, a palace official said, but the conversations would be private.
The palace had already scrapped the queen’s birthday parade, known as Trooping the Color.
That elaborate military procession is traditionally held in June and draws thousands of spectators to the wide avenue in front of the palace, where she waves from the balcony, as fighter jets roar overhead.
