Russia is reporting data for Crimea, a peninsula it annexed in 2014 in a move that led to international sanctions. Data for some countries, like the United States and France, include counts for overseas territories. Japan’s count includes 696 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship that docked in Yokohama.

There is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus. The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel throughout most of Europe, and to South Korea, China and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk Americans to avoid travel to any country.

While the outbreak is a serious public health concern, most people who contract the coronavirus do not become seriously ill, and only a small percentage require intensive care. Older people and those with existing health conditions, like heart or lung disease, are at higher risk.

United States

The number of known coronavirus cases in the United States continues to grow quickly. As of Saturday evening, at least 726,000 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 34,000 patients with the virus have died.

See our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.

The New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.

Europe

As the coronavirus pandemic surges across Europe, there are now more total confirmed cases outside of China than inside China, the country where the virus first spread. Many European cases have been traced back to Italy, which has one of the world’s largest outbreaks. In Italy and Spain, more than 150,000 people have tested positive.

Asia

The outbreak is believed to have begun in central China, and its early spread has been linked to people who went to a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The virus appears to spread easily, especially in confined spaces, making containment efforts difficult. Scientists and public health experts are still trying to understand how many people who contract the virus will die, but some early estimates put the fatality rate at roughly 1 percent.

The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know. Not all infected people have received a diagnosis, and some countries, like Singapore, have more proactive testing and containment efforts than others do.
