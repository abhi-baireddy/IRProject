Unfortunately, many people are likely to have occasion in the days and weeks ahead to write a letter of condolence to a friend, relative, colleague or acquaintance who has suffered the death of a loved one to Covid-19.
In typical circumstances, a letter of condolence should be written by pen on paper and sent in the mail.
Many mourners save condolence letters and turn back to them at anniversaries and other times of reflection.
Some of the most comforting condolence notes are sent not because we knew and loved the deceased but because we care about the survivor.
To conclude, you might offer a wish for the future and if you intend to reach out again, let the person know.
