State troopers and officers wearing N95 masks patrolled the event, but the sometimes loud demonstration unfolded peacefully, and there were no arrests. Beneath the extremist voices, there were Texans of all ages who were frustrated with the state’s stasis but did not necessarily support Mr. Jones.

A group of children held up their homemade sign — “Open our school: Education is a God-given right” — while others waved placards reading “Shut down the shutdown.” Nicole Adkins, 37, a stay-at-home mother and Army veteran who lives near San Antonio, held a sign that said “Flatten the Fear.”

It was the first protest Ms. Adkins had ever attended. The day before, the governor had announced his plan to reopen Texas, but Ms. Adkins was disappointed that Mr. Abbott was taking a gradual approach. He said he was reopening the state’s parks on Monday but would require all visitors to wear face coverings.

“It’s a park,” Ms. Adkins said. “Viruses don’t float through the air. You’re not going to catch it walking in a park, so there’s a lot of misinformation.”

Ms. Adkins and others were convinced that the government and the news media were lying to the public about the dangers of the virus, or at least were exaggerating the risks. Standing together in a crowd, mask-free and well within the six-foot social-distancing zone, was a physical manifestation of their anger and suspicion. They denied they were being reckless, and viewed the shutting down of society as a kind of hysteria, regardless of the numbers of infections and fatalities being reported.

Sandra Riley, 77, a retired real estate agent who lives in Austin, was one of the most covered-up protesters on the steps of the Capitol, but her outfit had nothing to do with safety. It was political theater.

She was wearing a purple-tinged sheet that covered her head and her entire body. She had cut out two holes so that she could see. The sign around her neck read “Feel safer now?”
