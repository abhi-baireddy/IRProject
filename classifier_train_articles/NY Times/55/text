The epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. is in New York, particularly concentrated in New York City and its surrounding areas. As of Saturday evening, 13,362 people had died. But the number of new cases in the state seems to have reached a plateau, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said, “I believe the worst is over if we continue to be smart.”

Note: County-level death counts are as of April 16, the last date for which state officials have provided this data.

New York City looks nothing like its former loud bustling self with many of its thoroughfares quiet and subdued.

But while subway use has plunged, ridership in poorer neighborhoods, where many must continue commuting to work, has not changed as dramatically. Overall, the city’s low-income neighborhoods have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. Many of the areas with the highest percentage of confirmed virus cases have the lowest median income, based on data from the first month of the outbreak.

Preliminary data on the City’s fatalities shows that the outbreak is killing black and Latino people at twice the rate that it is killing white people.

Current statewide order in New York Stay at home, effective March 22 at 8 p.m. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has shied away from the language of a shelter-in-place order, which he said evoked images of shooter situations or nuclear war. “Words matter,” the governor said, instead describing it as putting all of New York on pause. “This is the most drastic action we can take,” he said.
