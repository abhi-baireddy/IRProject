If it wasn’t for the relative context that we’ve been in, this would be devastating news: 2,000 people coming into the hospital system or testing positive. And if you notice — 2,000 — we’re not at the peak. But this is where we were just about in late March, when it started to go up. So we’re not at the plateau anymore, but we’re still not in a good position. And the worst news is still tragic news, number of deaths: 540. It’s not as high as it was, still 540 people died yesterday; 504 in hospitals, 36 in nursing homes. Nursing homes are the single biggest fear in all of this. Vulnerable people in one place. It is the feeding frenzy for this virus. The trick with testing is not that we don’t know how to do it. We’ve done it better in this state than almost any other state, almost any other country. It’s bringing this up to scale. We did 500,000 tests in a month. That’s great news. Bad news is, it’s only a fraction of what you need. The more you test, the more information, the more you can reopen society. Look, when we look at this state and we talk about reopening, we’re going to talk about different strategies in different parts of the state. Because the numbers dictate the strategy and you have different numbers in different parts of the state.
