LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson, resisting mounting pressure to fall in line with the radical responses of other European countries to try to curb the coronavirus, stuck to a notably restrained set of measures on Thursday, even as the Trump administration exempted Britain from a trans-Atlantic travel ban.
But Britain will not close its schools and it has yet to ban large public gatherings, like concerts or sports events.
Mr. Johnson’s approach was in marked contrast to those imposed by neighbors like Ireland and Denmark, where the authorities said they would ban mass gatherings and close schools.
It raised further questions about why President Trump exempted Britain from the travel ban, but not France or Germany, both of which have gone further than Britain to try to limit the spread of the disease.
These numbers, they warned, will rise rapidly over the coming weeks.
