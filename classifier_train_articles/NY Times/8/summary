BERLIN — Felix Germann was not expecting anyone when his doorbell rang last week.
“I didn’t do it!” Mr. Germann said, throwing up his hands, and everybody laughed.
The unusual visitors had come with an unusual proposal: Would he allow them to test his blood for Covid-19 antibodies?
He would be helping to further the science that would ultimately allow for a controlled lifting of social and economic restrictions and save lives.
“Of course I said yes,” said Mr. Germann, a 41-year-old project manager at a media company.
