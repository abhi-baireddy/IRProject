Perhaps these videos of returning animals offer us other kinds of comfort too.
We have for a long while now felt helpless and despondent about the fate of our planet.
These videos operate from the premise that our absence from our cities is temporary, an interregnum in which lessons can be learned.
I begin to see that the animals in these videos are far more than flesh and bone.
They are emissaries of hope and possibility, letting us dare to dream of a better world when this nightmarish darkness is gone.
