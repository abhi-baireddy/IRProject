Coughs, fevers, sore throats and runny noses have rarely been an emergency in the past, and those symptoms, even if due to the coronavirus, wonâ€™t be an emergency in most cases.
When should high-risk patients seek care?
Many people who have the coronavirus will not stay in a hospital and will be isolated at home.
Caring for someone with mild to moderate symptoms of the coronavirus is similar to caring for someone with the flu.
The World Health Organization has guidelines on home care for patients with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus.
