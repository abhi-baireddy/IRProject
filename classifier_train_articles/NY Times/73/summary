It was an article from a local Ohio news site, describing a small crowd that had gathered outside the statehouse to protest the state’s coronavirus shutdowns.
After fuming silently for a few minutes, I texted the link to my mother, who lives in Ohio, with the caption “Idiots!”Then I caught myself.
I wondered: Did a few dozen protesters doing something reckless and irresponsible thousands of miles away from me really deserve my outrage?
Did I really want to watch “Schitt’s Creek,” or did I just trust Netflix’s recommendations more than my own taste?
Which of my tastes, thoughts, and habits are really mine, and which were put there by an algorithm?
