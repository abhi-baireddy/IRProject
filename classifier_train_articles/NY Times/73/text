Recently, I saw something on Twitter that annoyed me. It was an article from a local Ohio news site, describing a small crowd that had gathered outside the statehouse to protest the state’s coronavirus shutdowns. They were urging the governor to ignore social distancing guidelines and open the state for business, a move that could endanger public health and potentially put thousands of Ohioans’ lives at risk.

After fuming silently for a few minutes, I texted the link to my mother, who lives in Ohio, with the caption “Idiots!”

Then I caught myself. I wondered: Did a few dozen protesters doing something reckless and irresponsible thousands of miles away from me really deserve my outrage? Or had I allowed myself to be whipped into a frenzy by people I’d never met, on a platform engineered to capture my attention and convert it into advertising dollars? Was I ignoring the larger forces at work — like the professional partisans who have made a living exploiting the paranoid and fearful, or the long, slow erosion of trust in mainstream health authorities — in favor of dunking on an easy target? Was I actually mad, or did I just feel like I should be mad?

This is not a new thought pattern. I have it a few times a day, whenever I find myself behaving in a way that feels less like genuine self-expression and more like giving in to the invisible tug of a faceless internet platform. Is the salad I’m making for dinner actually what I want to eat, or do I just think the photo will make me look healthy and responsible when I post it on Instagram later? Did I really want to watch “Schitt’s Creek,” or did I just trust Netflix’s recommendations more than my own taste? Which of my tastes, thoughts, and habits are really mine, and which were put there by an algorithm?
