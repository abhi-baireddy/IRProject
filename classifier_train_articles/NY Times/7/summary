By contrast, Medicare does have effective tools for restraining prices, which is a major reason Medicare for All has gained ground.
Third, there has to be a plausible way of financing this high-standard coverage as its reach broadens and costs rise.
In short, how you design the public option matters.
We can see these differences if we compare Mr. Biden’s proposal with the most ambitious public option plan offered during the campaign: the “transition” plan proposed by Elizabeth Warren after she backed away from an immediate leap to Medicare for All.
Her transition plan is itself a more robust version of a public option proposal introduced in Congress by Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Jan Schakowsky (which, full disclosure, I helped design).
