And as individuals, every person will be playing Russian roulette every minute of every day: Do I get on this crowded bus to go to work or not?
What if I get on the subway and the person next to me is not wearing gloves and a mask?
Do I get in the elevator at the office if there is another person on it?
What will be so cruel about this American version of Russian roulette is how unfair it will be.
Some people will have to send their kids back to school because they canâ€™t afford to stay home from work.
