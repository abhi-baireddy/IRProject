One doctor in New York City, who was not authorized to speak publicly, recalled anguished exchanges with other physicians last week.
“My job was hell.”As the coronavirus spread rapidly in New York and in other cities, governors and mayors clamored for thousands more ventilators.
But doctors have been surprised by the scarcity of dialysis machines and supplies, especially specialized equipment for continuous dialysis.
The shortages involved not only the machines, but also fluids and other supplies needed for the dialysis regimen.
The fluids needed to run the dialysis machines are not on the Food and Drug Administration’s watch list of potential drug shortages, although the agency said it was closely monitoring the supply.
