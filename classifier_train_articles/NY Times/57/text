Here are the things that we need from you. Today, we are asking people over 70 years of age or people who have compromised immunity or underlying respiratory conditions, to stay at home as much as they can. That means we need friends, family and neighbors to support our older New Zealanders and people who may be in this group by doing simple things, like keeping in contact and dropping off food or other supplies. When you do, make sure you are not sick, that you are using good handwashing practices and you’re keeping your distance. We also need everyone to start working differently. Many offices had plans for workers to work from home. Others have staggered meal breaks or shift-based working. We are now asking you to implement these plans. You’ll be pleased to know that we do consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers. And as you can imagine at this time, of course, they’re going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies and so I say to the children of New Zealand if the Easter Bunny doesn’t make it to your household, then we have to understand that it’s a bit difficult at the moment for the bunny to perhaps get everywhere. But I’ve a bit of an idea that maybe in lieu of the bunny being able to make it to your home, you can create your own Easter hunt for all the children in your neighborhood.
