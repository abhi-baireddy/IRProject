Turn your clippers on.
Start from the forehead and buzz the hair back to the crown of your head.
Going in small sections, slowly move the clippers from one end to the other — you will have to go over sections a few times to get an even look.
If you’re using a tool other than clippers, this process may take longer.
To do the sides, go from your sideburns back to the crown.
