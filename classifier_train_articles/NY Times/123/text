While there’s no definitive answer for whether you should remove your shoes when you enter the house, it may be a good general public health practice to change into house slippers after walking outside, said Dr. Boris Lushniak, the dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland. “This has nothing to do with Covid-19 — just with cleanliness in the house,” he said.

The same reasoning applies to changing out of clothing you’ve worn outside once you’re indoors, he said. “If, for example, someone sneezes or coughs on you, then obviously change clothes,” he said. “My sense is, let’s just be wary of what we’re doing and what kind of contact we have.”

Be Proactive

Have a conversation with all members of your household (especially children) about regular hand-washing.

If possible, try to plan for two weeks worth of meals and any other essentials to limit the number of trips needed for more supplies. If you’re able to, stock up on at least a 30-day supply of any necessary prescriptions as well.

Pick a room — and a bathroom, if you have a spare — that a member of the household can use to undergo stricter quarantine in the event that they become sick or come into contact with someone who is ill. If someone in your home is a member of a population that is more at risk of developing severe side effects from coronavirus, including older people and those with underlying health conditions, try to create a “protected space” for their use. Even if you appear healthy, assume you’ve come into contact with the virus and wash your hands before interacting with them.
