Lying in a hospital bed last month, Madhvi Aya understood what was happening to her.
She had worked for a dozen years at Woodhull Medical Center, a public hospital in Brooklyn, where she could see the coronavirus tearing a merciless path through the city.
She had worked in Woodhull’s understaffed emergency room, taking medical histories, ordering tests and asking about symptoms.
Ms. Aya, 61, was alone in a hospital, less than two miles from her husband and 18-year-old daughter on Long Island, who could not visit her.
“I have not improved the way should have been,” she wrote her husband, Raj, on March 23.
