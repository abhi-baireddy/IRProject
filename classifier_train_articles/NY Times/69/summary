Finally, with no restaurants to check out and no one to check them out with, I would have my nights to myself.
I was going to watch all of “Berlin Alexanderplatz,” and “The Sopranos” and “Parks and Recreation,” for starters.
Proust and I would resume our decades-long game of Monopoly, paused by me years ago for what was supposed to be a bathroom break.
All those goals have gone out the window since I discovered a video that was posted on YouTube last week called “Relax with Sheep.” In it, a herd of sheep grazes below the vines of Shafer Vineyards outside Napa, Calif., for more than six hours.
Mostly, though, the sheep stand and eat.
