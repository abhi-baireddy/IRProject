I had high ambitions for my time in lockdown. Finally, with no restaurants to check out and no one to check them out with, I would have my nights to myself.

I was going to watch all of “Berlin Alexanderplatz,” and “The Sopranos” and “Parks and Recreation,” for starters. Proust and I would resume our decades-long game of Monopoly, paused by me years ago for what was supposed to be a bathroom break.

Between meals, I planned kitchen projects. I left towers of cookbooks around the house with Post-it flags marking some recipes that required days, other recipes that took weeks and assumed I had access to a root cellar, and a handful of recipes that had no end date because their object was to keep some microbiotic sludge in a dish in the back of the refrigerator alive forever and ever, hallelujah, hallelujah.

All those goals have gone out the window since I discovered a video that was posted on YouTube last week called “Relax with Sheep.” In it, a herd of sheep grazes below the vines of Shafer Vineyards outside Napa, Calif., for more than six hours. There are occasional shots of sheep resting their puffy round bodies between meals, and once in a while a flock will march slowly out of the frame on their way to what I imagine must be greener pastures. Mostly, though, the sheep stand and eat.
