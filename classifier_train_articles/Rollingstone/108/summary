Recently, though, the musician’s Twitter has been transformed into a calendar and promotional tool for Tim’s Twitter Listening Party, an album version of a virtual book club.
Burgess originally intended the listening party as a one-off event for the Charlatans’ album Some Friendly, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.
“We’re more of a collectors’ band.” As such, Williamson is taking full advantage of that — he’s on the schedule to host a total of seven listening parties (and counting) down the line.
‘Tim’s Twitter Listening Parties’ — ’listening’ is the most important word in that sentence.
Because it is all about listening to the record and reacting to it in real time.
