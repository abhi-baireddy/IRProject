After moving to Nashville in 2001, Chris Stapleton kicked off his career as a songwriter for other singers, spending his days whipping up hits for Kenny Chesney, Josh Turner, and Darius Rucker.
His own bands came and went along the way, including a run with left-of-center bluegrass group the SteelDrivers and one album with half-serious Southern-rockers the Jompson Brothers.
By the time his duet with Justin Timberlake at the 2015 CMA Awards catapulted his solo career to the top of the mainstream, Stapleton had become one of the industryâ€™s best-kept secrets: a songwriter, guitarist, and knockout singer whose pen was just as mighty as his voice.
