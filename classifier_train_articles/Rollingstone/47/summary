Adeline, former singer for nu-disco outfit Escort, contemplates the end of a relationship on her new song, “Twilight,” set to appear on her upcoming EP, Intérimes, out June 12th.
“Twilight” is a captivating soul tune that’s light on its feet thanks to a bouncy bass, crisp drums, and twinkling keys, not to mention Adeline’s bright and dextrous vocals.
In a statement, Adeline explained: ” ‘Twilight’ is about a relationship that’s ending.
You have nothing left to give and there’s nothing left to say.
The twilight is the period from dawn to sunrise or sunset to dusk.
