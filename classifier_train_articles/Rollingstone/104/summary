Jason Isbell’s guitar foil Sadler Vaden, Philadelphia songwriter Roger Harvey, and Dierks Bentley’s alter-ego Nineties group all have songs on this week’s list.
Here, he nods to his classic-rock roots with a song whose six-string heroics are steeped in the funky, fiery influence of Joe Walsh.
Hailey Whitters, “Janice at the Hotel Bar”Like a sonic sister to Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert, Hailey Whitters turns ordinary, small-town characters into extraordinary subjects.
Hot Country Knights, “Pick Her Up”With tongues firmly in cheek and hair proudly in mullets, Hot Country Knights toast the bygone days of Nineties country, mixing humor and honky-tonk hooks into this gem of a debut single.
Co-written with Maren Morris — another Texas-born Nashvillian who, like Darien, uses country music as a jumping-off point for a broader, bolder sound — “Twisted Metal” mixes Americana atmospherics with overdriven guitar and throaty hooks fit for pop royalty.
