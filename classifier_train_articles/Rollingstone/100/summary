And the best air compressors and jump starter kits will have emergency features built-in like flashlights and hidden storage compartments for your valuables.
Power: How much power, measured in amps, is your jump starter and how much power are you going to need?
The air compressor function includes different nozzle sizes, useful for inflating a variety of recreational inflatables in addition to your flat.
We like it because it ticks all the boxes of things weâ€™re looking for in a reliable air compressor.
And of course, it includes the extras we always look for including the powerful air compressor and USB charger.
