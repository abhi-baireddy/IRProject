Soul veteran Don Bryant has released “Is It Over,” the second offering from his forthcoming album You Make Me Feel.
The album is a follow-up to Bryant’s triumphant 2017 return-to-form Don’t Give Up on Love, his first record in nearly a half-century.
“I wanted to ask, ’Is it over?’ And if it is, should it be this way?
“The more I take my mind off it by playing music, the better I feel.”Bryant and Peebles worked together at Memphis’ Hi Records during the label’s Seventies heyday.
When I can concentrate on that, I can take my mind off everything else.”You Make Me Feel will be released May 8th on Fat Possum.
