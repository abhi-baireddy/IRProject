Courtney Marie Andrews has released “Burlap String,” the second song from the singer’s upcoming album Old Flowers.
In the accompanying video, Andrews re-enacts the song’s acute sense of loss, wandering around a dusty trail in southern Arizona as she ruminates on her own heartbreak.
Speaking more generally about her new album, the singer says that Old Flowers is “about heartbreak.
There are a million records and songs about that, but I did not lie when writing these songs.
Old Flowers, Courtney Marie Andrews’ first album since 2018’s breakthrough May Your Kindness Remain, will be released June 5th on Fat Possum Records.
