K-pop group, Monsta X, may be stuck in quarantine right now, but don’t accuse the guys of taking it easy.
The now six-piece boyband (former member Wonho recently announced he was launching a solo career), say they’re doing their best to stay busy — and to follow the rules — during this unexpected break.
The album, the first all-English set released by a K-pop act in more than a decade, debuted at number five on the Billboard charts, making MONSTA X one of only four K-pop artists to hit the Billboard top ten.
In the meantime, the guys say they’re prepping the release of a new Korean album for May.
“I often visit our fan cafe and I read all the letters from [MONSTA X fandom] Monbebe,” says Minhyuk, adding that he often hits the “Cheer” button on posts.
