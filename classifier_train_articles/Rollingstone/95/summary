If it seems like Nashville’s well of talented singer-songwriters is never-ending, that’s probably because it is.
And Mercy Bell, living in Music City by way of Boston and New York City, is another distinct voice with a potent, progressive take on emotive, modern folk.
It’s a perspective clear on her new song “Home,” where Bell confesses to the coping mechanisms that have let her avoid life’s harshest moments, and a path to redemption that’s better late than never.
“Could you come pick me up?” she sings in gorgeous harmonies and strings courtesy of Larissa Maestro and Kristin Weber, two of the town’s most gifted instrumentalists.
“Forget the years that I’ve spent drunk.” With a vibrato that’s as strong as it is vulnerable, Bell makes it easy to forgive her trespasses.
