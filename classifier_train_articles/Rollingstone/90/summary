I don’t know, Woody Allen seems sane to me.
But it goes further than that: Woody Allen is one of the most well adjusted people I’ve met in New York.
Directing is enervating, and very often you’re standing around on freezing-cold street corners at six in the morning, and I don’t think anyone would find that much fun.
You know, you really don’t have to keep doing a film a year and be compared to Bergman to get a table.
You wouldn’t like it if once a year there was a Woody Allen ticker-tape parade up Broadway?
