Movie theaters across the country may still be closed due to coronavirus concerns, but there are a number of ways to catch new releases from the comforts of home. If you’re looking for something to watch while quarantining, a number of movie studios are either releasing new films directly online, or moving up VOD release dates for films that were just in theaters.

We’re updating this list with the most popular titles you can stream online right now. Each of these films are available for rent, for purchase (as a digital download on on DVD/Blu-ray) or to stream via a streaming service like Disney+ or Hulu. Many of these streaming services are offering free trials right now too, to help people stay entertained while stuck at home.
