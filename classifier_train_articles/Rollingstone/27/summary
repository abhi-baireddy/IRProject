Nicole Atkins was supposed to be dropping her new album, Italian Ice, on Friday, but the release date has been pushed back to May 29th due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Still, fans will be able to catch the album on its original release date, April 17th, with two YouTube livestreams — one at 3:00 p.m.
Atkins released her latest Italian Ice video “Domino” earlier this month, featuring clips shot on the Jersey Shore.
Last month, she performed “Domino” from her Nashville home while in quarantine for Rolling Stone‘s IGTV series In My Room.
She continues her Alone We’re All Together livestream series on Saturday, April 18th, at 7:00 p.m.
