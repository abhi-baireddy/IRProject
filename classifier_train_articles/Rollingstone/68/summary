Isbell’s annual Ryman gigs have become as familiar a part of Nashville’s modern-day makeover as construction cranes — which is appropriate, given that the songwriter is clearly building something here.
From the downbeat to the encore, guitar strummers ruled the roost last night.
Jimmy “Duck” Holmes kicked off the evening with an opening set of loose, greasy, horn-dog blues, delivered from a single chair planted center stage.
Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit took the stage sometime after 9 o’clock, looking like Americana superheroes with their Mike Campbell scarves (guitarist Sadler Vaden) and floor-length, Watchmen-worthy trench coats (fiddler Amanda Shires).
And last night, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit reminded Nashville — a city whose very landscape seems to change every year — that familiar ground is a solid place to stand.
