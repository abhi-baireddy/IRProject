“I’m not in love with the Leslie BGV’s.”Over the past year, Combs has been making trips to New York to work on his latest album, Ideal Man, with the producer Sam Cohen.
The lead single of Ideal Man, “Stars of Longing,” with its opening fuzzed-out guitar riff, announces the album’s gentle shift away from a traditional roots template.
That said, Ideal Man isn’t an entirely unrecognizable collection of music, structurally or sonically.
Some songs on Ideal Man are about people Combs has long observed from afar.
That’s cool, man,” says Combs, who, despite liking this take more, is still not quite satisfied.
