December 1969: The Rolling Stones are capping off their decade of triumph with a new album.
They dropped Let It Bleed in the final days of a decade that didn’t turn out the way they or anyone else hoped.
The Stones made Let It Bleed in a cloud of bad vibes — in other words, their comfort zone.
“Let It Bleed” remains the Stones’ funniest sex comedy: Mick tarts it up with his schoolgirl gasps over Keith’s slide guitar.
And that’s why Let It Bleed stubbornly refuses to fade into the past — like the Stones themselves.
