New York City ‘s Seaport District will be the site of an Independence Day celebration launching Hot Country Live, Spotify’s new live concert series that will further extend the popular streaming service’s flagship Hot Country playlist.
Carrie Underwood will headline the Fourth of July event, which will take place at the Seaport’s Rooftop at Pier 17 concert venue.
Additional Hot Country Live concerts are planned for select cities nationwide.
In addition to the Hot Country Live concerts, the Pier 17 Rooftop Concert Series, which launches August 1st with an appearance by comedian Amy Schumer, is the latest development in the revitalization of the Seaport District.
She was among the headlining artists who appeared at the nightly concerts during last weekend’s CMA Music Festival.
