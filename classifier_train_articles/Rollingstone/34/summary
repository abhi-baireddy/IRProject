Carey Mulligan seeks revenge on prowling men in the new trailer for Promising Young Woman.
The thriller from Killing Eve showrunner Emerald Fennell premieres at Sundance and opens in theaters April 17th.
Mulligan stars as Cassie, a woman whose life was turned upside down by a “mysterious event” in her past, and who now lives a double life at night.
It’s not revealed in the trailer, but, at the end, she does appear in a nurse’s outfit with some sinister medical tools.
Promising Young Woman marks Fennell’s feature film directorial debut, following her work on Killing Eve as well as her role as Camilla Shand in The Crown.
