“We just need two genres.”With a new playlist, Spotify is hoping to answer that call.
“The through-line is highlighting contemporary country music, and carrying on the traditions and cultural influence of the genre,” says Laura Ohls, Senior Editor at Spotify.
An important distinction for Indigo is that the bulk of the featured artists, Ohls says, “self-identify as country artists.” In other words, not exclusively Americana but “Indigo,” as Spotify hopes they’ll become known.
At last year’s Metrics That Matter session at Country Radio Seminar, streams, Shazams, and Pandora “thumbs ups” were all prominently factored into how programmers formatted their playlists.
Spotify isn’t the only one trying to push Lane’s idea of shaping country radio into something more inclusive and imaginative.
