As promised, the Wonders — the fictional band at the heart of That Thing You Do!
— reunited via Zoom Friday night to watch and provide commentary to the 1996 film.
The watch party raised money for MusiCares’ COVID-19 Relief Fund.
The Wonders’ reunion was a tribute in part to Fountains of Wayne’s Adam Schlesinger, who also penned the Wonders’ hit “That Thing You Do!”; Schlesinger died at the age of 52 from complications related to COVID-19.
Prior to the watch party, the Wonders spoke to Rolling Stone about Schlesinger.
