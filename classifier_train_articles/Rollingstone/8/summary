Delivering his latest monologue from the at-home Late Show, Stephen Colbert took one of his favorite targets, President Donald Trump, to task.
Earlier this week, Trump announced that states on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may soon be ready to reopen and invigorate the damaged economy, even before his previously set May 1st deadline.
Colbert also mocked pro-Trump protestors in Ohio and Michigan, who this week demanded that the governor reopen businesses despite the ongoing outbreak.
Protestors demonstrated outside their respective state houses, blocked traffic (not that there’s much traffic right now, with shelter-in-place orders in effect), and waved giant flags, including Confederate ones.
“Because nothing says ‘never surrender’ like a Confederate flag,” Colbert said with a wink.
