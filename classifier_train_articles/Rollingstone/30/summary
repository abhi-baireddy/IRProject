Reich calls the Imperial College report “one of the more comprehensive modeling efforts” of the coronavirus to have come out so far.
“A model is just that, a model,” Reich says.
“Embedded in every model are many untestable assumptions, and [the Imperial College] model certainly makes many big blanket assumptions that won’t be fully 100 percent true.
“I think that this underscores the challenges that even experts face when predicting rare and uncertain events,” Reich says.
It’s sort of this outlier, and it can be hard even for experts to accurately anticipate.”
