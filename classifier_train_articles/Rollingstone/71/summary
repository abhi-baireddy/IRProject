Leave it to Willie Nelson — whose reddish-white hair, jolly disposition and fondness for green foliage sort of makes him the Stoner Santa Claus — to ditch the Christmas season’s traditional scents of frankincense and myrrh in favor of the potent, pungent aroma of marijuana.
Back in 2008, Shotgun Willie teamed up with a comedic dream team — including The Colbert Report host Stephen Colbert, Daily Show executive producer David Javerbaum, Portlandia writer Allison Silverman and Fountains of Wayne’s Adam Schlesinger — to deliver “The Little Dealer Boy,” a 420-friendly tribute to the holidaze.
In the song, Nelson plays the oft-forgotten “fourth wise man” who shows up to Jesus’s crib with his own special gift.
During the hour-long broadcast, Colbert finds himself trapped in a cabin in New England.
The two-and-half-minute clip of “Little Dealer Boy” features Nelson — clad in a costume that could’ve been stolen from the nativity scene outside of the nearest church — delivering the song with stony stoicism, occasionally joined on background harmonies by a turtlenecked Colbert.
