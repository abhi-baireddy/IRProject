One day after its employees staged a walkout in protest, Hachette Book Group announced that they will not be publishing Woody Allen’s memoir, Apropos of Nothing.
“The decision to cancel Mr. Allen’s book was a difficult one,” the company said in a statement.
The announcement ensued in controversy when Allen’s son, investigative reporter Ronan Farrow, took to Twitter to announce his separation from Hachette.
“Each book has its own mission,” Michael Pietsch, chief executive of Hachette, told the New York Times on Thursday.
Grand Central publishing believes strongly that there’s a large audience that wants to hear the story of Woody Allen’s life as told by Woody Allen himself.
