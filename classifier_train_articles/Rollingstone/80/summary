Since 2015, the Phoenix, Arizona metal band Okilly Dokilly has drawn inspiration for their devastating songs from the most unlikely source: The Simpsons’ most devout character, Ned Flanders.
They dress in green sweaters, pink shirts and tan slacks, their lyrics are predominately made up of Ned Flanders quotes and they proudly claim to be the world’s only “Nedal” band.
Now the group has stopped by Rolling Stone to explain how anyone can apply the wholesome wisdom of Ned Flanders to their music and life.
“Just make sure that you are always respectful to thy neighborino,” Head Ned says.
“And when things get heavy out there in the pit, that you lift thy neighborino up.”
