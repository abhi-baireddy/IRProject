“It is impossible for me to describe what this feels like right now,” Brandi Carlile said, addressing the crowd for the first time, three songs into her sold-out show at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.
Never was this more apparent than when the singer brought out the Highwomen to booming applause.
Apart from her slew of covers, Carlile’s show repeatedly highlighted her own forebears, as evidenced by the spirited opening set from Staples.
Staples’ set, as per usual, was anchored in her message of joyful resistance and peaceful bridge-building.
It’s a message Carlile has always carried close as a songwriter, artist, and activist, a message she reinforced when she invited Staples back for a duet on “Friendship,” an ode to kind companionship written by Mavis’ father Pops Staples.
