The next James Bond movie may not be out until November, but those looking for an injection of murder, mystery and mayhem can find solace in Season Three of Killing Eve, which is set to arrive two weeks early.
All eight episodes will premiere Sunday, April 12 at 9 p.m. EST on BBC AMERICA and AMC.
“This season of Killing Eve digs deep psychologically, and with actors like Sandra Oh, Jodie Comer and Fiona Shaw the results are nothing short of astonishing.
“All seems fine until a shocking and personal death sets them on a collision course yet again,” the release teases.
“The journey back to each other will cost both of them friends, family and allegiances…and perhaps a share of their souls.”Suzanne Heathcote (Fear the Walking Dead) is the lead writer for Season Three of Killing Eve.
