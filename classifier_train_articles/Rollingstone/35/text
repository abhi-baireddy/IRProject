The next James Bond movie may not be out until November, but those looking for an injection of murder, mystery and mayhem can find solace in Season Three of Killing Eve, which is set to arrive two weeks early. All eight episodes will premiere Sunday, April 12 at 9 p.m. EST on BBC AMERICA and AMC.

“We know how adored this series is and we know how keen people are for great content right now,” Sarah Barnett, president of AMC Networks Entertainment Group and AMC Studios said in a release. “This season of Killing Eve digs deep psychologically, and with actors like Sandra Oh, Jodie Comer and Fiona Shaw the results are nothing short of astonishing. We literally couldn’t wait for fans to see it.”

When last we left assassin Villanelle (Comer) and ex-MI6 operative Eve (Oh), the former had shot the latter and left her for dead after a brief love affair and a complicated job involving a famous tech bigwig. The new trailer finds the assassin enjoying her singledom, curiously dressing as a clown at a child’s birthday party and flouncing around in her characteristically fabulous outfits. Soon, however, she discovers what we suspected all along: Eve is alive. Cue Villanelle’s inextinguishable fury — and passion.

“All seems fine until a shocking and personal death sets them on a collision course yet again,” the release teases. “The journey back to each other will cost both of them friends, family and allegiances…and perhaps a share of their souls.”

Suzanne Heathcote (Fear the Walking Dead) is the lead writer for Season Three of Killing Eve. Phoebe Waller-Bridge of Fleabag fame previously wrote for the show and serves as executive producer. The show is based on the Codename Villanelle novellas by Luke Jennings.
