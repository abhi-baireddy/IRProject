Purple Rain star Apollonia Kotero slammed Prince collaborator Sheila E. in a social media post following the release of Sheila E.’s Prince tribute song “Lemon Cake” earlier this week.
“Lemon Cake” arrived a week before the Let’s Go Crazy: The Grammy Salute to Prince special, featuring Sheila E., airs on April 21st.
In an interview with Billboard after the release of “Lemon Cake,” “The Glamorous Life” singer said, “One day I mentioned to him that I make a good chocolate and lemon cake.
My mom being Creole and my dad Mexican, I better know how to cook.’ The next day I baked a lemon cake.
Prince refused to acknowledge you for 5 years before his death because of your lies,” Kotero wrote of Sheila E. on Facebook (via Okayplayer).
