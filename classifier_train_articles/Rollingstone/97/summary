The Simpsons‘ newish animated short film, Playdate With Destiny, will be available to stream on Disney+ starting tomorrow, April 10th (watch with a 7-day free trial here).
(The Simpsons, long associated with Fox, became a Disney property after the entertainment giant purchased 21st Century Fox in 2019.)
In a note on Instagram, Simpsons creator Matt Groening shared a message from the creative team saying, “Earlier this year we made a nifty short film called Playdate With Destiny.
“Will fate (or Homer) get in her way?”Playdate With Destiny marks the second Simpsons short film, following 2012’s The Longest Daycare, another bite-sized piece centered around Maggie.
That short aired before Ice Age: Continental Drift and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film.
