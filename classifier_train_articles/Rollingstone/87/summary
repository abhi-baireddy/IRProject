Leaving festivals like Woodstock and Monterey aside, there is no more famous gig in rock & roll history than when the Beatles played Shea Stadium, an orange and blue ass pit of a venue in front of 56,000 mostly teenyboppers on August 15th, 1965.
Chances are if you’ve seen footage of a single Beatles gig, it is this one.
And, for many years, the tales surrounding that Shea Stadium gig, plus the footage, plus the bootleg of the show, reinforced all of this.
It was called The Beatles and the Great Concert at Shea!
Listening to something like the Shea line recording of “She’s a Woman” you realize that “Drive My Car” is not far away and a logical progression.
