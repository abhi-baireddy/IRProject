In honor of St. Patrick’s Day, let us raise a dirty glass to the spirit of Irish music, wherever in the world it shows up.
And like the Irish people themselves, Irish music shows up everywhere, usually a few moments after the bottles get opened.
So here’s a pub crawl of a playlist, chasing that spirit down a few of its rowdier rock & roll twists and turns.
Because Irish music — again, like the Irish people — never knows when to shut up and never will.
Nobody’s ever made the song sound as lonesome as the Pogues, with accordion, tin whistle and Shane MacGowan’s spewed-up-in-church voice.
