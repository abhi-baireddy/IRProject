Paul McCartney performed a touching solo rendition of the Beatles’ “Lady Madonna” during Global Citizen’s One World: Together at Home special, which raised funds for global COVID-19 response efforts.
“I’m very honored to be part of this program tonight that celebrates the true heroes: Our health care workers all around the world,” McCartney said prior to his home performance.
“As this COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis, we all have to come together to fight it on a global scale.
In a statement, Global Citizen’s co-founder and CEO Hugh Evans said of the special, “As we honor and support the heroic efforts of community health workers, One World: Together at Home aims to serve as a source of unity and encouragement in the global fight to end COVID-19.
Through music, entertainment and impact, the global live-cast will celebrate those who risk their own health to safeguard everyone else’s.”
