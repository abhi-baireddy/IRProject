While there are many bands without even one good vocalist, some groups are blessed with several.
Think of the Cars, the Commodores or the Beatles, all of whom had multiple hit singles with different band members taking turns at the microphone.
Sometimes, however, a band gives a member who isn’t the usual lead singer a chance in the vocal booth.
