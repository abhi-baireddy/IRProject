That probably has a lot to do with the fact that Killing Eve has been trading out showrunners like Villanelle switching designer lewks between murders.
And, at least for the season’s first five episodes, Killing Eve 3.0 is more concerned with sounding the characters’ psychological depths than with building fresh intrigue.
Killing Eve is at its best when it’s going completely batshit, and Heathcote’s take is just a few hairs too normcore.
Even when it’s not at the top of its game, Killing Eve is still compulsively watchable, and that’s largely down to its excellent central performances.
When it’s firing on all cylinders, Killing Eve is a machine that runs on chaos.
