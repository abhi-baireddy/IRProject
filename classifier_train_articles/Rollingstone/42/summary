On Wednesday, voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams spoke with Rolling Stone staff writer Tessa Stuart about the virus’ impact.
Abrams, who was once Loeffler’s lawyer, called on the Georgia senator to resign.
“I know Kelly Loeffler, I’ve worked with her, and I’m deeply disappointed in what she is accused of doing: $18.7 million in stock trades.
And I think it’s wrong-headed.”This is the second installment of Rolling Stone’s latest new video series, “RS Interview: Special Edition,” featuring in-depth conversations with notable figures in music, entertainment and politics.
New episodes premiere every Thursday afternoon on Rolling Stone’s YouTube channel.
