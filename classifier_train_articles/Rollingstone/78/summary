Right now, it seems almost mythical: just 20 years ago, it was not only conceivable to tune into a country radio station and hear a woman singing, it was highly likely.
The ears of the country consumer seemed to appreciate, demand and even prefer the voices of women.
Even more rare than hearing a woman’s song on country radio, though, is one scoring that coveted Number One spot.
On this week’s Billboard country recurrent chart, there is not a single song in the Top 20 by a solo woman.
If country radio played more women, that is.
