Michael McDonald shared a tender acoustic performance of his 1986 smash with Patti LaBelle, “On My Own,” on The Tonight Show Thursday.
Although the song is about a tough breakup, “On My Own” carries an obvious resonance now as people continue to self-isolate during the coronavirus pandemic, which McDonald acknowledged before his performance.
“To those of you out there who may be alone during this pandemic, we’re thinking about you, and I dedicate this song to you,” he said.
“It’s nothing too ambitious, really,” McDonald said of the project.
It’s a barn and we’re all on headphones in the same room trying to get out of everyone’s way.”
