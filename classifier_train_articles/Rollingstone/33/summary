Sen. Bernie Sanders has suspended his campaign for president, conceding the 2020 Democratic nomination to former Vice President Joe Biden.
We are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible.
The fact that Sandersâ€™ campaign stalled in South Carolina, where black voters comprise 60 percent of the electorate, was not a coincidence.
Sanders improved his standing with the black electorate in 2020, but his inability to win over older black voters proved a weakness.
A Late February poll showed black voters younger than 45 overwhelmingly favoring Sanders over Biden.
