Enter The L Word: Generation Q, a reboot that picks up where the first series left off, and makes a valiant effort to atone for some of the original’s shortfalls.
Then there’s the proverbial Generation Q, which, true to the new series’ stated purpose, represents a vastly more diverse array of human beings.
Generation Q features a lot of aspects of the queer female experience that The L Word shied away from.
The struggles in Generation Q are different than the struggles in the original.
Generation Q might not necessarily be breaking new ground, but it is staking a claim.
