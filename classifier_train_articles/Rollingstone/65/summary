No one ever knew what to call Mumford & Sons.
In the late Nineties, the Americana Music Association formed in Nashville as a way to centralize promotion of the type of singer-songwriter and folk-based country music that had found itself without any proper commercial home as country music radio consolidated.
But the term Americana had never been attached to an act in the pop mainstream until Mumford & Sons were introduced to the States en masse in 2010.
But over the past decade, the eternally-hard-to-define roots-music community has exploded into a low-overhead, commercially viable pop genre.
Perhaps no moment of the past 10 years better illustrated the increasingly thorny racial and genre politics of Americana than emerging country star Chris Stapletonâ€™s viral 2015 CMA Awards performance with secret 2010s Americana influencer Justin Timberlake.
