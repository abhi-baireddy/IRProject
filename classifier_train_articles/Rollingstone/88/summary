New York — ABKCO Industries president Allen Klein will release four albums by the Rolling Stones.
Klein, who managed the Stones from 1965 to 1970, owns the release rights to much of the material the group has recorded throughout its career.
Klein claimed that ABKCO, the publishers of many Stones compositions, has always owned the rights to the material, including the unreleased songs.
It’s pretty pathetic.”The “original material” album was delivered by the Stones to Klein on April 1st but will probably not be released as is.
“He [Klein] don’t like it,” Jagger said, adding that the Stones feel the same way.
