In 2016, I asked Gemenne, an expert on migration influenced by climate change, what he thought of these estimates.
Over and over again, this prediction is widely cited as “widely cited,” and has been held up as “the accepted figure” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and publications like the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.
There has been recent progress in accurately measuring the scope and nature of climate migration.
The more important result, de Sherbinin explains, was pinpointing these hyperlocal “hot spots” for climate migration within these regions.
At the high levels of the UNFCCC, which runs the annual U.N. climate talks, and the U.N. Security Council, the co-authors explain, there are explicit assertions of “mass climate migration” that risk “aggravating conflicts.”“This self-referencing narrative in scientific literature and policy reports has the consequence of entrenching climate migration as a looming security crisis without an empirical scientific basis,” they write.
