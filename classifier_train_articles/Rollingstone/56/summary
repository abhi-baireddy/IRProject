Fiona Apple has unveiled the release date of her fifth studio album.
Fetch the Bolt Cutters will arrive digitally on April 17th.
The news was unveiled via a video, which features a dog running on a beach to a percussive soundscape.
Actress-model Cara Delevingne also makes a cameo appearance on the album’s title track.
While Fetch the Bolt Cutters is her first studio album in nearly eight years, over the past year she has dropped a number of singles, including the Simon & Garfunkel holiday song “7 O’Clock News/Silent Night” (with Phoebe Bridgers and Matt Berninger) and a cover of the Waterboys’ “The Whole of the Moon.”
