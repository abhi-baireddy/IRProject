In 2017, Thundercat accomplished all that on his third album, Drunk, and his new follow-up, It Is What It Is, is just as daring in its musical reach, and its pairing of goofy and gutting.
The record finds Thundercat continuing to parse the existential crises of everyday life, especially inside the void left by the death of his friend, Mac Miller.
The lyrics, too, remain straightforward as Thundercat tries to find the right words to describe what is essentially the overwhelming sensation of nothingness.
It’s also ostensibly a nod to Miller himself, who used the phrase on “What’s the Use?” a cut from his final album, Swimming, on which Thundercat appeared as well.
On the album’s final song, the title-track, Thundercat sings, “Hey, Mac,” and the rapper’s voice echoes in response, a lone but lovely, “Woah.” And with that encouragement, Thundercat lifts off to the place he always seems most comfortable, the outer reaches of inner space.
