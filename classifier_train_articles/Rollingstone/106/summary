“I Contain Multitudes” is Bob Dylan’s second surprise new song in three weeks, making it seem increasingly likely that the Nobel Prize winner has a new album on the way — which would be his first collection of original songs since 2012’s Tempest.
“I paint landscapes/I paint nudes,” Dylan sings, with a near-audible wink.
And occasionally, he may be intent on pure shock: “I’m just like Anne Frank/Like Indiana Jones/And them British bad boys the Rolling Stones,” he sings.
“Murder Most Foul,” released in March, is a 17-minute-long song that jumps from John F. Kennedy’s assassination to a kaleidoscopic look at 20th-century America.
Dylan’s most recent album was Triplicate, the latest in a series of LPs devoted to covers of prerock standards.
