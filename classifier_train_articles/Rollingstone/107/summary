When Kelsea Ballerini was designing the merchandise to accompany her third album, Kelsea, she wanted one item in particular: sweatpants.
Ballerini was supposed to be traveling for 21 straight days to promote Kelsea, doing the standard stops at talk shows and radio stations, and orchestrating surprises across the country.
Instead, she ended up at home in her downtown Nashville apartment, “dropping” the album to a few fans via a safe, social distance-acceptable drone.
“Half of My Hometown” is one of her favorite songs she’s ever written, and she even texted Chesney at 2 a.m. to ask if he would be willing to add vocals.
And then there’s the aptly named “Country Song,” which is both an ode to her core as a writer and also serves as a sly debunk of whatever a proper country song is supposed to be — or what’s allowed to be mentioned.
