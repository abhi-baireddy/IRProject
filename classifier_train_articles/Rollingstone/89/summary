Ed O’Brien has been an under-appreciated but crucial part of Radiohead ever since the band formed in 1985.
He’s noted in interviews that he felt he had to release the record, that part of him would “die” if he didn’t.
Joined by Laura Marling, O’Brien carefully lays down each line over twinkling acoustic guitar: “You and me all night long,” they sing in harmony.
“You and me in this storm/holding tight.”With Earth, O’Brien becomes the fourth Radiohead member to branch out and release a record of his own, following Yorke, guitarist Jonny Greenwood and drummer Phil Selway.
The success of all these extracurricular releases, including Earth, suggests that when he does, it’ll be worth waiting for.
