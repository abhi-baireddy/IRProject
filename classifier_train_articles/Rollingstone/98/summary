This month marks the 40th anniversary of the Clash’s London Calling.
London Calling documents one of the mightiest bands in rock history operating at the absolute peak of its abilities.
The “London Calling” lyrics reflect the chaos that was engulfing the world at the time.
Drawing on the chaos, Strummer’s “London Calling” lyrics are essentially a radio broadcast from a dystopian future that was easy to envision at that point in time.
Notably, it’s the first song they recorded for London Calling and it set the stage for everything that followed.
