Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden for president on Monday during a Biden campaign livestream, where the two appeared via split-screen.
Not just to win the campaign, but to govern.”So far every Democratic presidential candidate, save for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has now endorsed Biden as the party’s nominee.
Sanders currently holds 918 delegates and will continue to accrue them if he earns votes in the upcoming contests.
Last week, Sanders promised to use his delegates to influence the Democratic Party’s platform.
“While Vice President Biden will be the nominee, we must continue working to assemble as many delegates as possible at the Democratic National Convention, where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions,” Sanders said.
