For a time after their VR experience, people found themselves eating less meat.
The hope is that this technologically-enabled empathy will help us to become better, kinder, more understanding people.
While VR might help us to cultivate sympathy, it fails to generate true empathy.
I distinguish between them like this: empathy relates to the cognitive and emotional abilities that help us feel with another.
Such failures of sympathy, grounded in false beliefs about our VRâ€™s ability to produce empathy, can be avoided.
