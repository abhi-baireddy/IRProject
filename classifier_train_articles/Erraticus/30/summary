Truth’s IndispensabilityBeliefs about what is true are typically shared by others in one’s society: fellow members of one’s culture, one’s nation or one’s profession.
A society that has lost its shared reality is also unwell.
Typically this means narrowing one’s circle of confidants to one’s tribe, one’s side of the aisle, one’s ethnicity or one’s religion.
Deeply committed advocates and true believers from both sides are making it difficult to rebuild that invaluable common ground that shared reality rests upon.
