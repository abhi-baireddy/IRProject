The School of Life: An Emotional Education (2019) is a carefully curated volume compiled by the philosopher Alain de Botton (founder of an organization that shares the book’s name).
Conventional schooling makes knowledge acquisition its primary goal while emotional education trails as an afterthought.
The School of Life promotes a more humanistic approach to a successful life.
He states, “The Romantics were brilliantly perceptive about some dimensions of emotional life and were extremely talented about expressing their hopes and longings.
This is not a knock, per se, against The School of Life, but meant to guide readers’ expectations.
