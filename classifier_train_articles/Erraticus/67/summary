A true belief gets reality right: our words correspond to objects and relations in the world.
The pragmatic theory of truth arose in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the 1870s, in a discussion group that included Peirce and William James.
Philosophy, James said, â€œis at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits.
A true belief is the belief that we would come to, were we to inquire as far as we could on a matter.
Lewis saw that the pragmatist theory of truth deals nicely with those beliefs that the correspondence theory stumbles over.
