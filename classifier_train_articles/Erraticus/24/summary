But while democracies give every citizen an equal right to vote, epistocracies apportion political power, by law, according to knowledge or competence.
It requires tremendous social scientific knowledge: knowledge that most citizens lack.
For instance, an epistocracy might deny citizens the franchise unless they can pass a test of basic political knowledge.
A major question is what counts (and who decides what counts) as political competence, or basic political knowledge.
Democracy and epistocracy both spread power among the many, but epistocracy tries to make sure the informed many are not drowned out by the ignorant or misinformed many.
