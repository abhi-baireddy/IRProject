Saudade is a key emotion word for Portuguese speakers.
Portuguese speakers complain of “dying of saudades” (morrendo de saudades), or wanting to “kill saudades” (matar saudades) by fulfilling desire.
Most scholars suggest that this form derives from the Latin solitate (solitude), and was possibly later influenced by the Portuguese word saudar (‘to greet’) before arriving at the present form.
This would also mean that emotion words such as nostalgia or saudade take on different affective shadings in different places and historical periods.
In 1940, the Brazilian writer Osvaldo Orico described Brazilian saudade as “more happy than sad, more imagination than pain … a saudade that does not cry, but sings.” Orico’s notion of a happy saudade reflected the joyous, optimistic notion of brasilidade (“Brazilian-ness”) that emerged during the early years of the first Getúlio Vargas regime (1930-45).
