Even so, that doesn’t necessarily mean we won’t exceed the planet’s carrying capacity.
What the palaeoarcheological record strongly suggests is that carrying capacity is not fixed.
There is no particular reason to think that we won’t be able to continue to raise carrying capacity further.
Nor must one posit the collapse of human societies to worry deeply that growing human consumption might have terrible consequences for the rest of creation.
But threats of societal collapse, claims that carrying capacity is fixed, and demands for sweeping restrictions on human aspiration are neither scientific nor just.
