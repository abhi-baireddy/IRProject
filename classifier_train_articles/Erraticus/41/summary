We commiserated about the same anxieties which accompanied each milestone in our lives, always understood through the same gospel lens, gifted to us by our faith community.
Returning to my faith community felt like imprisonment, stagnation at best, and I had little desire to join a new one.
Could I build a faith community without a belief in God?
I wondered if belief in someone or something supernatural was requisite to reap the benefits of a faith community.
For me, I still have not been able to recreate the power of membership in the faith community I left.
