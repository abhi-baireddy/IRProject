Blue countries represent the locations of 93 percent of studies published in Psychological Science in 2017.
If people thought and behaved in basically the same ways worldwide, selective attention to these typical participants would not be a problem.
WEIRD Studies Arenâ€™t UniversalBecause so little research has been conducted outside this narrow set of typical participants, anthropologists like me cannot be sure how pervasive or consequential the problem is.
A growing body of case studies suggests, though, that assuming such typical participants are the norm worldwide is not only scientifically suspect but can also have practical consequences.
Proponents disagree on the best paths to moving beyond WEIRD science to building a science of all humanity.
