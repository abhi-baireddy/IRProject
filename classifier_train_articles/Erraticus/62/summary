The word cult, along with other terms utilized to describe minority or emergent religions, instantly stigmatizes the group under consideration.
Although cult once had a legitimate and useful meaning—a system of religious veneration and devotion, according to Merriam-Webster.com—its first meaning today is “a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious.”Thus, a host of euphemisms has arisen: new religious movement (or NRM), alternative religion, minority religion, unconventional religion, marginal religion, and so on.
This leaves us with several dilemmas: What do we call the dozens, or hundreds, of harmless religious groups that seem to pop up every other day?
Until then, however, painting any or all alternative groups as cults is unwarranted at least, and deliberately dehumanizing at worst.
