In his new book, Strong Towns (2019), Charles L. Marohn, Jr. argues that these two facts are not a coincidence.
His vision shows Strong Towns that are resilient and adaptive, a prosperous America, populated by close-knit communities invested in vibrant, local life.
Local problems, local solutions.
Overall, I found Strong Towns to be very pragmatic.
If you are frustrated by the fragmentation of community in modern society or skeptical of federal-level interventions, and want a glimmer of hope, Strong Towns will appeal to you.
