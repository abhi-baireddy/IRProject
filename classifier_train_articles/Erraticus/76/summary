‘What is the meaning of life?’…professional philosophers rarely ask the question and, when they do, they often dismiss it as nonsense.
What is the meaning of “meaning” in “the meaning of life”?
We talk about the meaning of words, or linguistic meaning, the meaning of an utterance or of writing in a book.
When we ask if human life has meaning, are we asking whether it has meaning in this semantic sense?
But the search for life’s meaning will not go away and it is perfectly intelligible.
