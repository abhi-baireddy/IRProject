Michel Serres was born in Agen, France in 1930 and died Saturday, June 1st, 2019.
A recurring theme in Serres’ work is that science consists of its own epistemology.
Serres was a philosopher of communication, who was interested in “spaces of transformation” or “what exists between,” as he writes in The Parasite (1980).
A work evolves by growing, like a tree or an animal.” This quote offers profound insight into the practice of Serres’ philosophy of affirmation.
He was not only a beautiful thinker but also a life-affirming one who can best be described as a poetic philosopher.
