Transparency, I will argue, is an illusion that undermines the most elementary part of life: trust.
In his novel The Circle, Dave Eggers describes a company called “The Circle” that believes transparency is a moral good.
Being curious requires courage and a society that trust its citizens and accepts that not everything serves a given end, at least not directly—because a scientist conducting research may not discover anything useful.
Yet, if the ideal is that transparency equals both moral and knowledgeable superiority, it most likely only promotes conformity and undermines trust.
Transparency is the end of trust and the birth of predictability.
