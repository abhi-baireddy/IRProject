[Read “Anxiety Due to Absence of Exposure to Real Danger“]Three Postulates for Deconstructing AnxietyThere are three postulates that form the foundation for this quest, which I call the Deconstructing Anxiety model:There is an absolute truth that can be realized.
Deconstructing anxiety resolves fear’s distortions, opening the way back to absolute truth and returning us to our natural state of fulfillment.
It has become “fashionable” to accept the inevitability of our human condition, to believe that transcendence and an absolute truth are not possible.
If we want to know whether an absolute truth is possible, we must make certain we are unafraid to consider it.
