But when Jung read Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), he was startled by Freud’s theory, and decided to go to talk with the man himself.
As an intellectual movement, early psychoanalysis resembled a political party—perhaps even a nascent religion—with Freud as its immovable center.
If Freud found in Jung a gentile dauphin, what did Jung see in Freud?
In 1906, Jung had applied his word-association test to Freud’s theory of free association, a crucial tool in exhuming repressed memories.
Jung announced his “religious crush” for Freud, and Freud, in turn, wrote that “your person has filled me with confidence in the future.” This devotion took a filial form: Freud the father, Jung the son.
