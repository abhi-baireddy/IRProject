A research team from Hull University and associated NHS trusts in the UK suggest that, among the tumult, hallucinations can also offer opportunities for growth.
The interviewees were united in seeing the arrival of their hallucinations as an unwelcome shock.
Another said that without his hallucinations, he would feel “hollow.”Exactly what good could come from hallucinations?
The answers were hard to pin down because no interviewee felt that they were an unalloyed good, and they didn’t want to tempt fate through naive optimism.
Participants continued to see their hallucinations as something that hindered them, but it was now tempered by the possibility of enrichment.
