She graciously showed me around The Clearwater School, an educational community in the Seattle-Area founded on the Unschooling philosophy, or the Sudbury Valley model.
More accurately, the Clearwater School has no top-down or authority driven structure.
These Sudbury schools don’t use grades either, and the Clearwater School has had huge success with college.
She didn’t recognize my friend, which was weird for such a small school community.
