Streaming isn’t the only reason we’ve recently gained this power over television creators.
We also have a myriad more ways to display that influence, from Netflix ratings to social media.
One hour-long series, subtracting commercials with 20-23 episodes in a season equals more than eight hundred minutes of content.
If you’ve invested that much time into a story, chances are you’ve also invested quite a bit of emotional energy.
We’ve combined buying power with streaming culture and nostalgia to create this perfect storm of reminiscent TV.
