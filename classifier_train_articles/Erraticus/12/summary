We have only just begun to explore the physical, psychological, and social effects of devices that render all reality a simulacrum.
Given this frame, it’s not surprising that real, physical community has collapsed.
So, the next wildly successful community, religion, cult, or social movement is likely one that solves atomization, and to solve atomization is to solve the problem of the individual’s inability to overcome the machine’s conquering of mental cycles.
If states and companies can only nudge on the margins, the bulk of the work falls on the shoulders of social technologists.
However, anything that solves or at least ameliorates this problem enough to produce real community is going to look extremely strange to the rest of society.
