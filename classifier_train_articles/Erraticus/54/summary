It is not simply that people feel lonely; it is that people are less connected than they have ever been.
They send their kids to daycare as both parents work just to pay the cost of modern life.
In the end, they appear a patch which, while useful, still succumb to the rootlessness of modern life.
This leaves people feeling simultaneously unfulfilled by their job and their family life, with their personal desires seeming trivial and their work life draining.
I often joke that to have friends today, you need to have the mindset of a founder.
