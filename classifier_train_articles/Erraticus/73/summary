Recently more than 200 Australian Montessori schools celebrated the centenary of Montessori education in Australia.
While Montessori classrooms around the world can be found in both public and independent schools, in Australia, Montessori schools are most often privately owned or community/parent-run independent schools, which charge fees.
All students in Montessori classes, whether in government schools or independent Montessori schools, are required to address Australian curriculum outcomes.
A challenge specific to Montessori schools is the difficulty of recruiting specialist Montessori teachers because of the cost and limited availability of internationally-recognized Montessori teacher training.
To meet the perceived needs of todayâ€™s children, Montessori schools are often pressured to update aspects of the traditional program.
