Art unites us, and beauty moves us toward the Transcendent.
The highest reaches of art reveal beauty in a way that conveys a sense of attaining to or a loss of something spiritual.
The ancient Greeks, who also understood beauty as a reflection of ultimate reality, did not believe individuals create beauty.
Art and beauty have two different but overlapping trajectoriesâ€“one toward union and the other toward transcendent reality.
Art that reveals beauty in a meaningful way must be animated by at least a hint of the transcendent.
