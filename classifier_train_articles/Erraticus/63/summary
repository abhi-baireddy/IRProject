A key focus in Steiner education is on age-appropriate lessons aligned with the developmental stages of the child.
Currently there are more than 1200 Steiner schools, also known as Waldorf schools, in 60 countries worldwide.
A Dutch government inquiry in 1995 found that, outside of a single unrepresentative incident, there was no evidence of racism in Steiner schools.
On a more practical level, due to the generally smaller scale of the schools, subjects offered may be limited at some Steiner schools.
Through its focus on capabilities, creativity, and resilience, Steiner education aligns with many of the goals of 21st-century education.
