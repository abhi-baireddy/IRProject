So pleasant experiences are necessarily valuable, but are there also valuable experiences that are not necessarily pleasant?
When we say that a book is interesting, we more likely mean that the experience of reading the book is interesting.
It is within this synthesis that a person finds an experience interesting, or not.
While wrapping our head around the interesting might be challenging, it is important to acknowledge the value intrinsic to interesting experiences.
For many of us, though, interesting experiences are more rewarding than pleasurable experiences, insofar as their intrinsic value is a product of multifaceted aspects of our engagement.
