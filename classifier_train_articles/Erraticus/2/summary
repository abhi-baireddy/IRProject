If so, then you’ve had an experience of what philosophers from the mid-18th century to the present call the sublime.
There are two kinds of response to the sublime: what I call the “thin” and the “thick” sublime.
For Burke, the experience matters insofar as it is the “strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling.” But for Kant and Schopenhauer, the experience is profounder still.
The source of the pleasure in sublime experiences derives, according to Kant, from an appreciation of our capacity for moral and theoretical transcendence of mere nature, and, in Schopenhauer, from a reflection on the two-fold nature of our selves.
Are such accounts as those offered by Kant and Schopenhauer relics of a more metaphysical age?
