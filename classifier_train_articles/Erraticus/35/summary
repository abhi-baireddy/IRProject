Nearly 1/3 of the U.S. population will watch the same game at the same time cheering on players they’ve never met.
Why then, do audiences chant during climactic situations when players need the least distraction?
It may not even be your team, but you can’t deny getting swept up just a little in the excitement.
Combine athletics and heart with cultural tension, and players learn to be better than those around them, not just on the field but also as people (Remember the Titans).
When you see that team’s done well, don’t you get a little excited for them knowing how happy they must be?
