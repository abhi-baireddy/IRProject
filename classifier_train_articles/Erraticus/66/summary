“To die would be an awfully big adventure” crows Peter Pan, the cocky paragon of eternal youthfulness and fairy tale flights.
Peter Pan has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters since he first took center stage in the December 1904 London premiere play of Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up.
He encounters the Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, while lingering outside their nursery window, listening to Wendy’s stories.
Barrie created the Peter Pan stories to help others cope with death.
This is captured by the only meaningful choice Peter Pan makes during the Neverland epic: to stay a lost boy forever.
