But now it’s 2020, and Apple has released Fetch the Bolt Cutters, her fifth album and first in eight years, since 2012’s The Idler Wheel... (Apple loves long album titles — hence all the ellipses.)
Bolt Cutters is “about” a great many things (if anyone can claim any Apple album, full of eclectic influences and ideas, to be “about” any handful of things).
But to boil Bolt Cutters down to that single idea is to miss the richness of what Apple is trying to do.
Fetch the bolt cutters.
Fetch the Bolt Cutters is available on all major music platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.
