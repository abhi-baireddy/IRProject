Itâ€™s a momentous day in world cinema: The Cannes Film Festival has been delayed due to the Covid-19 coronavirus.
The move seemed inevitable, despite repeated statements that the festival would go on from organizers over the past few weeks.
Additionally, the festival is attended by industry professionals and press from around the world, including from countries where coronavirus is rampant.
The Cannes Lions festival was postponed until August.)
Cannes has only been canceled once since then, in 1968, when the festival ended halfway through its nearly two-week run.
