Mental health care services might be inaccessible through traditional means, but never before have they been so accessible through phones and computers.
A lot of people who might not have previously felt a need for mental health services are now finding themselves unsure of how to deal with the increased anxiety, uncertainty, and isolation this pandemic has brought.
States like California and Arizona have ordered all insurers to cover telehealth services, too, and changes in other states could be coming.
You can also find a therapist through “fast therapy” apps like TalkSpace, which connects you to a licensed therapist through not just video chat, but texting, too.
You can find some clarity and purpose in knowing that you’re helping protect people by moving your health care online.
