San Diego Comic-Con will not take place in 2020, marking the first cancellation of the event in its entire 50-year history.
Comic-Con, the largest fan convention in the US, usually takes place in late July and is an annual pilgrimage for countless fans.
San Diego Comic-Con is the latest event to be affected by an ongoing wave of cancellations and postponements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Earlier this week, the Cannes Film Festival, originally tentatively delayed until summer, announced that plans for a summer event had also been placed on indefinite hold.
Comic-Con’s cancellation is an especially severe blow to the city of San Diego, which reaps about $150 million in annual revenue from the event’s 135,000 attendees.
