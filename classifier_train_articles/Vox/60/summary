The global and domestic spread of the novel coronavirus has prompted travelers to reassess their travel plans through 2020.
If you’re hesitant to move forward with a trip at this point, most travel insurance won’t cover a cancellation, according to Squaremouth, a travel insurance comparison site.
That’s because travel insurance is “designed to cover unforeseen events,” and Covid-19 is now considered a “foreseen event,” unless you purchased it before a specific date, Squaremouth content director Steven Benna told me.
To put it simply, the most basic travel insurance options are likely not offering refunds for the coronavirus — no matter how widespread the disease becomes.
If you’ve already purchased trip insurance for an upcoming vacation, the best thing you can do is read the fine print or call the insurance company to figure out what’s covered under your policy.
