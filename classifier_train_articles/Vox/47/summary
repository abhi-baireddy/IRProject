When a pandemic sweeps the globe, making large gatherings of people incredibly dangerous, how does the Walt Disney Company respond?
The earliest available reservation at Walt Disney World or Disneyland Resort is June 1.
But the Walt Disney Company soon announced it would temporarily shutter all of its Walt Disney World hotels on March 20.
(Disney’s Vero Beach Resort and Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort closed on March 20 and Aulani, a Disney Resort in Hawaii, closed on March 24; both now remain shuttered until further notice.)
