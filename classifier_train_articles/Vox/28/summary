We now know you canâ€™t effectively fight the coronavirus pandemic without widespread testing to find out who has the disease.
The high-end proposal, from Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer, starts at 22 million tests per day and goes up.
Why testing is so critical to controlling the Covid-19 pandemicSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is almost perfectly optimized to infect huge swaths of a population.

To coordinate this effort, Allen and her colleagues have proposed creating a Pandemic Testing Board along the lines of the War Production Board created by the US government in World War II.
