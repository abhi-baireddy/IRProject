On March 24, the studio announced that Wonder Woman 1984, the sequel to the hit 2017 DC Comics movie, will be postponed until August 14 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Wonder Woman was a box office success, defying expectations and hauling in $821 million worldwide during its theatrical run.
Wonder Woman 1984 was going to be a glimpse at that future.
Wonder Woman herself became a renewed cultural touchstone, a celebration of power and accomplishment for people of all gender identities.
Wonder Woman 1984, fellow female superhero movie Black Widow (from Marvel), and Disneyâ€™s live-action remake of Mulan have all been shelved because of the coronavirus pandemic.
