The next day, a state trial judge in Austin rejected Paxton’s reading of this absentee ballot law, holding that Texas voters should have broad access to absentee ballots during the pandemic.
All nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court are Republicans, so there is a very high likelihood that Paxton’s narrow reading of the law will prevail if Texas Democratic Party reaches the state supreme court.
They argue that the words “physical condition” include the physical condition of being susceptible to the coronavirus.
But it is far from clear that the Texas Supreme Court, with its entirely Republican membership, will choose to uphold voting rights here.
If voters remain on lockdown this November, millions of Texans could be disenfranchised if they cannot obtain absentee ballots.
