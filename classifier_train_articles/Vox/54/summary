There are reports of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers using bandanas and scarves for masks and trash bags for gowns.
The CDC, acknowledging the shortage, previously recommended homemade masks for health care workers when no other options are available.
A big issue was adherence; people were often bad at actually wearing masks, which, unsurprisingly, diminished their effectiveness.
As health care workers clamored for masks, it became increasingly harder to tell the public that masks wouldnâ€™t benefit everyone else.
At this point in the pandemic, health care workers and facilities all over the country will gladly accept the help they can take.
