The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new, preliminary nationwide data on Friday, that revealed 30 percent of Covid-19 patients are African American, even though African Americans make up around 13 percent of the population of the United States.
The Associated Press reports that based on available state and local data, about a third of US Covid-19 fatalities are of African Americans â€” although in the areas analyzed, only about 14 percent of the population was African American.
And state-by-state data compiled by Mother Jones shows wide disparities in both infections and fatalities among people of color.
In Wisconsin, for example, African Americans represent 6 percent of the population, but nearly 40 percent of Covid-19 fatalities.
As [Fabiola] Cineas notes, 22 percent of black Americans lived in poverty in 2018, compared with 9 percent of white Americans.
