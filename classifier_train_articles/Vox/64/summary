In a time when people are consumed with cleaning, sanitation, and germs in a way that is new for many, there has been a tremendous amount of confusion around which cleaning products to use, and for what.
In these days of increased levels of sanitization plus shortages of cleaning products, it occurs to me to wonder about cross-uses.
Another side effect of using cleaning products for non-intended purposes is that it can encourage a mindset of mixing products, and that also can be dangerous to the point of being deadly.
This is not alarmist, either: Improper use of cleaning products — especially ones that contain bleach, alcohol, or ammonia — really does kill people.
