Trump announced guidelines on April 16 for states to reopen, calling for governors to ease social distancing measures, such as stay-at-home orders, as the number of new coronavirus cases begin to come down.
What the country needs to properly do testing, according to experts, is at least 500,000 tests a day.
A recognition of that fact is perhaps the biggest reason the US is social distancing now.
Experts warn the next phase of testing will be much more difficult than the initial phase, which largely required getting existing labs to start doing coronavirus testing â€” the low-hanging fruit.
The Trump administration and states also still have time to ease testing criteria and scale up capacity in the coming weeks.
