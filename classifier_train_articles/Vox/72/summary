Overall, the question of school closures, like so much about the coronavirus pandemic, exposes not just the severity of the current situation but the fault lines that existed in American society before the crisis hit, just waiting to be tested.
As the week wore on, teachers and others reported that New York City was mishandling its response to the coronavirus crisis.
The potential duration of school closures is another major issue.
The CDC has said that school closures of under four weeks likely will not have a meaningful effect on the spread of the virus.
Overall, experts, teachers, and parents alike recognize that school closures, both in New York and elsewhere, are an incomplete and uncertain way to fight coronavirus spread.
