Kate Brown signed an executive order on Friday that prohibits debt collectors from seizing federal stimulus checks meant to help Americans endure the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier this week, the governors of Illinois and Washington state also signed orders to protect stimulus checks from garnishment.
Under the CARES Act that authorized the stimulus, the checks are protected from being collected by most federal and state debt collectors.
A number of Democratic senators — as well as Republican Sen. Josh Hawley — have requested the Treasury Department bar private collectors from garnishing the checks.
In some states, there are existing laws that could protect the stimulus checks.
