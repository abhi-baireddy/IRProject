US-based airlines have canceled thousands of flights as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the country.
Most airlines have now expanded and waived change and cancellation ticket fees for both domestic and international flights as people reassess their travel plans.
The DOT’s mandate will likely ensure that passengers will be able to get their money back if the airline experiences significant delays or cancellations that affect a passenger’s flight.
Delta will waive change fees for all international and domestic flights through May and for travelers who purchased a ticket between March 1 and April 15.
United will allow all passengers scheduled to travel through April 30 to change their flights without a fee.
