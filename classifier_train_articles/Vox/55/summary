The US Department of Labor registered nearly 3.3 million initial unemployment insurance claims last week, according to data newly reported on Thursday morning.
That shatters the previous record, which was about 700,000 in seasonally adjusted terms, or a million in raw terms, way back in 1982.
Just a few days ago, a Goldman Sachs analysis predicting 2.25 million initial claims was seen as an alarming forecast.
This is data released on the morning of March 26, but it covers the period that ended on March 21.
But the sheer volume of claims is high — literally off the charts — and there’s little reason to believe Thursday’s report is the end of the economic pain.
