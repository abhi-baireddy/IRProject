The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) failed to follow appropriate manufacturing procedures while developing the United States’ coronavirus test, resulting in contamination that delayed making tests available nationwide, according to an investigation by the Washington Post’s David Willman.
That can’t be done safely until widespread testing is available, and experts say the US is woefully behind.
The CDC violated its own standards when developing the testing kits in a lab that was also working with synthetic coronavirus material, the Post reported.
The CDC took more than a month to correct the issue, hindering efforts to limit the early spread of the coronavirus in the US.
The error — and the delay in fixing it — likely contributed to a delay in testing that allowed the virus to spread undetected.
