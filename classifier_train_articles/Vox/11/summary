The IRS officially deposited the first wave of direct stimulus payments last weekend, the agency announced on Twitter.
Individuals must also have a Social Security number to qualify for a direct payment.
Adults who are claimed as dependents by other adults, including many college students, will not be eligible for a direct payment.
When will people receive direct payments?
The answer to this question depends on if you have filed taxes in 2018 or 2019.
