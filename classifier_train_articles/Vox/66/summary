— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020A lot of people besides Trump have been comparing the coronavirus to flu.
It takes around five days for Covid-19 infection to develop symptoms (the most common are fever and a cough).
I think I get why Trump is so eager to compare Covid-19 to the flu.
By mentioning the flu numbers, Trump is hoping to get people thinking of big numbers, and induce numbing.
If you see people make the flu comparison, don’t be fooled into thinking that Covid-19 is an equivalent.
