The United States government has ordered 20 million N95 masks for health care workers through a set of suppliers that are overwhelmingly unproven and untested, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.
N95 masks are more complex — and more complicated to make — than a surgical mask.
As Recode’s Rebecca Heilweil explains, certified N95 masks are “special”:Unlike a conventional surgical mask, N95 masks are built so that 95 percent of very small airborne particles can’t get through.
In order to fulfill those requirements, N95 masks must be constructed so that they seal tightly around one’s mouth and nose, unlike surgical or cloth masks which are loose-fitting.
Taking a gamble on untested suppliers has already proved troublesome for other governments.
