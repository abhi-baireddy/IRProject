Today marks the 100th anniversary of when President Woodrow Wilson signed into law America's first permanent income tax.
So the income tax quickly was extended to almost everybody with a heartbeat who went to work.
The Social Security/FICA/Payroll tax really is an income tax.
The top tax rate was only 7 percent, the tax form was only 2 pages, and the entire tax code was only 400 pages.
Once the income tax was adopted, though, it became a lot easier to finance subsidies, handouts, and redistribution.
