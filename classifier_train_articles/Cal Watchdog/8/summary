Enacted in 2018 over the vigorous objections of Silicon Valley tech giants, California’s first-in-the-nation online privacy law took effect Jan. 1, 2020.
Californians can ask companies which collect information online what information they have on them.
Google, however, has put up a website that says the company welcomes the California law and will fully adhere to its intent of letting consumers control their personal data.
The law does not apply to businesses with annual revenue of less than $25 million that do not buy or sell personal information on at least 50,000 people a year.
A likely future policy fight is over whether California companies should be banned from obtaining such personal information from firms that don’t honor online privacy laws like the Golden State’s.
