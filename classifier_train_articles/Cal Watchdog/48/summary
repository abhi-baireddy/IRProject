The California Legislature’s determination to lessen the amount of sugary drinks consumed by state residents may never have been greater than now – at least if the metric used is the number of bills introduced.
For the third time, Assemblyman Richard Bloom, D-Santa Monica, has introduce a measure that would tax soda and other beverages sweetened with sugar.
Bloom said 9 percent of state residents are diabetic and nearly half are at risk of developing diabetes.
Sen. Bill Monning, D-Carmel, is for the fourth time proposing that sugary drinks sold in California have labels warning of their health risks.
But other research into Berkeley’s soda tax is far less encouraging, according to University of Southern California professor Michael Thom.
