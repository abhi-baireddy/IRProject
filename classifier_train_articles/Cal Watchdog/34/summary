Jerry Brown called for “serious groundwater management” to crack down on overdrafting.
Such adjudicated groundwater basins are examples of self-regulated groundwater management, with the courts acting only as referees.
If groundwater basins are not drawn down below their annual safe yield, they will recharge.
The major difference between voluntary local government groundwater management and state regulation is that the state has the power to issue shut-down notices and compel compliance with law enforcement.
Groundwater is not generally monitored in some 200 water basins where the population is sparse and groundwater withdrawals are typically low.
