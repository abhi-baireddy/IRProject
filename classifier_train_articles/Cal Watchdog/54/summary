In late February, Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, introduced Senate Bill 726, a direct response to a proposal by President Donald Trump.
The president wants to eliminate the federal estate tax, which imposes a 40 percent income tax on estates valued at $5.5 million or more.
Wiener’s measure would institute a California estate tax that’s identical to the federal estate tax.
Under Wiener’s bill, the state tax would only go into effect if Congress does away with the federal version.
Re-imposing a California estate tax would only make the state budget much more volatile.
