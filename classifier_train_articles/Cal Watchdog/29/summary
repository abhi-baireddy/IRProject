Teachers in the Sacramento City Unified School District have authorized a strike, hoping to follow in the footsteps of teachers in Los Angeles Unified and Oakland Unified and secure substantial raises after a brief walkout.
Coverage in regular and social media has repeatedly emphasized three points:The Sacramento City Teachers Association secured an 11 percent raise for most members in September 2017 after threatening a strike.
The Sacramento County Office of Education warned at the time that without significant cuts, the district faced fiscal disaster.
The union’s hope that a strike authorization vote would lead to new concessions hasn’t happened so far.
A union statement said the strike was coming “at a date likely in the next month.”
