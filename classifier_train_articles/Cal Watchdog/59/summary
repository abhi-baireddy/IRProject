San Francisco this week enacted its $15 minimum wage, making it the first major U.S. city to mandate a $15 wage floor for all businesses.
It’s the last phase of Proposition 14, which voters passed in 2014 and raised the wage in increments of $1.00 through 2018.
While the hourly wage may increase, it’s also likely to force businesses to cut prices – and possibly the hours of their workers.
“San Francisco already has a major problem facing low wage workers,” George Mason economist Michael Farren explained on C-SPAN.
“So the additional cost of $15 hour minimum wage and the effect it’s going to have on prices isn’t going to help low-wage workers very much.”
