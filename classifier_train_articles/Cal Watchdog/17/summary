In addition to policing issues, Bettenhausen identified potential earthquakes, flooding and forest fires as requiring coordinated mutual aid of emergency services.
While no one disagreed with the necessity for mutual aid between agencies, Dutton challenged the prioritizing of the many non-emergency programs police and fire departments have.
The hearing did not address the redundant Emergency Medical Technician services within emergency responder agencies, or why so many different emergency agencies respond to medical emergency calls.
The emergency medical agencies provided information about the medical supplies they have “stockpiled” in the event of a serious disaster.
Several police and fire captains said many of the agencies are not able to respond outside of their departments to the mutual aid system because of vast budget cuts.
