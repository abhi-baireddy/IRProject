The Obama administration – which was disappointed that California was the only state to accept federal high-speed rail funding – was content to extend deadlines to try to help the Golden State project find its way.
Under Obama, rail officials also rejected complaints from California House Republicans that the state project was breaking federal rules.
DOT chooses to go after the California High-Speed Rail Authority, it has a wealth of examples that it can site to show the state’s 2009 grant request made false claims about the soundness of the state project.
Such subsidies were explicitly banned by Proposition 1A, the 2008 state ballot measure providing $9.95 billion in bond seed money for the then-$34 billion project.
But as the Associated Press noted, the federal government doesn’t need California to write it a check to get its money back.
