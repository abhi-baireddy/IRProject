It reported that, of 198 human-induced earthquakes since 1929, only one was indirectly related to oil and gas fracking itself.
No fracking earthquakes in California in 66 yearsBased on the Durham study and other online data sources, only 10 human-induced major earthquakes from all causes occurred in California over an 84-year time span concurrent with rapid industrialization (see table below).
In addition to the Durham study, only three other fracking related earthquakes could be found in the world, one of which occurred in the U.S. No fracking-related earthquakes are reported to have occurred in California.
The Durham University study considered an alleged fracking earthquake in Ohio in 2013 (up to 2.7 magnitude).
To do that, fracking and geothermal related earthquakes may have to be sold to the public as a high risk.
