Now a new UCLA study finds that of the 4 million adults in California who are 65 or older, 1.11 million struggle to make ends meet — an effective poverty rate of 28 percent.
That’s more than triple the number of California elderly who were considered impoverished under standard federal measures.
… According to the study, about 340,000 Californians 65 years or older are considered poor based on the Federal Poverty Level, which makes them eligible for public assistance programs.
A primary cause of economic insecurity among the elderly is their reliance on fixed incomes that can’t handle sudden increases in housing costs.
They vote at higher rates than younger residents and form coalitions with other groups that have lost favor with city hall.
