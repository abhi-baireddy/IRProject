SACRAMENTO – Does California have a voter turnout problem?
But voter turnout rebounded in the 2016 general election, with 14.6 million people voting during the Donald Trump v. Hillary Clinton race.
Jerry Brown recently signed the “Prime Time Primary Act,” which moves all of California’s primary elections from June to March.
“The 2002 California primary had the lowest turnout of any California primary in history, up until that point.
“While the importance of local elections is beyond debate, voter participation in these elections has not followed suit.”He argued that the 2015 passage of Senate Bill 415, the California Voter Participation Act, would eventually help boost these numbers.
