Democratic lawmakers are harshly criticizing the Trump administration’s attempt to defy the intent of a new state law banning privately run prisons and detention centers.
Private detention centers holding unauthorized immigrants are seen as a symbol of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency that has become a target for the left since President Donald Trump’s election.
They say ICE is flouting normal procedures in an attempt to ensure three existing facilities keep operating.
ICE signed a $62 million contract with GEO for the Adelanto facility in March in which GEO was the only bidder.
In their letter to DHS and other agencies, the California Democratic lawmakers asked for information on how ICE crafted its solicitation for detention center bids.
