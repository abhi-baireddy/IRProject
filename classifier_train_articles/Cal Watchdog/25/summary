A bill that would allow labor unions to organize farm workers passed the Assembly Monday.
SB 104 is authored by Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, and is sponsored by the United Farm Workers union.
I recently described how card check works:In card check elections, workers can be intimidated and coerced into signing a card saying that they want union representation.
But they failed to disclose that the bill would have no impact on abusive employers other than to impose union controls on workers.
Democrats insisted that the bill only adds card check as an “option” to collective bargaining.
