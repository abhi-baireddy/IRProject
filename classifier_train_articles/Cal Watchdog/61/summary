“You can draw the conclusion that it’s more than less likely,” Chairman of the California GOP Jim Brulte told CalWatchdog about the connection between having a Republican on the ballot and party turnout.
Cox is also likely eyeing a boost from the party at the state convention in early May in San Diego.
For the first time, Brulte explained, delegates from the state party will vote to endorse either John Cox, Assemblyman Travis Allen, or for no endorsement.
But Brutle also noted that “irrespective of candidates statewide there’s a number of issues and initiatives” that are expected to contribute positively to GOP turnout.
