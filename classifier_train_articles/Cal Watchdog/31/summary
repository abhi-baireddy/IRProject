He has introduced Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8, which would lower the voting age from 18 to 17.
Twenty-three states allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if they will be 18 on the day of the general election.

Republicans have been generally opposed to Low’s measure at least partly for partisan reasons.
“It makes no sense for San Francisco to send the message that voting is a responsibility any less serious than these are.”
