Jerry Brown signed into law sweeping new measures that put consumers and producers of nicotine-based products on the defensive.
One bill will “raise the legal age to buy products from 18 to 21,” while another “dramatically tightens restrictions on e-cigarettes,” NPR reported.
“Anyone who gives tobacco or tobacco paraphernalia to someone under 21 could be found guilty of a misdemeanor crime,” the Associated Press cautioned.
Applicable legislation now “defines e-cigarettes as tobacco products, barring their use in workplaces, schools, hospitals and on public transit,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
California State University and even community college students could soon be barred from smoking or vaping on campus.
