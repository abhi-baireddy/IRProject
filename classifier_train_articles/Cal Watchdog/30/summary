A new study conducted by the prestigious non-partisan National Bureau of Economic Research, “California Energy Efficiency: Lessons for the Rest of the World, or Not?,” casts serious doubt on the claim of California’s legendary energy efficiency compared to other states.
1 Energy efficiency factor: Household sizeAccording to Levinson, the biggest factor in California’s lesser usage of electricity is nothing but larger household size.
3 Energy Efficiency Factor: Shift to Southwest U.S.
Levinson describes declining residential electricity usage as the “poster child” of California energy efficiency regulations.
Levinson concludes that the data undermine support for California energy efficiency standards as the cause of the state’s relatively lower energy usage.
