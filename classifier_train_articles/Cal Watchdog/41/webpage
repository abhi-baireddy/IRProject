</div>
<p><a href="https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2019/08/07/da-targets-sheriffs-inner-circle-in-apparent-corruption-probe/">Allegations</a> that Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith and some of her top brass traded concealed weapons permits to a private company protecting top Facebook officials in return for a large campaign donation have dogged Smith since July and August, when the Santa Clara District Attorney’s Office began serving search warrants on homes of top department officials and searched the sheriff’s headquarters.</p>
<p>The primary focus of DA investigators – at least publicly – has been a $45,000 donation from <a href="https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2019/08/14/security-firm-pledges-full-cooperation-with-da-during-investigation-into-sheriff-smith/">Martin Nielsen</a>, the leader of the AS Solution private protection firm, to the Santa Clara County Public Safety Alliance, a political action committee that backed Sheriff Smith in the 2018 election cycle and helped her win a sixth term. AS Solution operatives subsequently got several permits.</p>
<p>In September, San Jose Inside – the online website that broke the story of the probe in August – and other outlets <a href="https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2019/09/20/sheriff-gave-gun-permits-to-private-security-officials-after-45k-political-donation/">reported</a> that in 2018, there had been a deposit of $70,000 into Nielsen’s Citibank account just before he made the donation to the pro-Smith PAC. That raises the prospect of someone or some organization trying to launder campaign contributions, which is a violation of state law. San Jose Inside also reported last month that Santa Clara County Undersheriff Rick Sung had <a href="https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2019/11/08/da-targets-santa-clara-county-undersheriff-as-part-of-ongoing-concealed-weapons-probe/">his home raided</a> and some electronics confiscated by the DA’s office.</p>
<h4>Report faults lack of standards on permits</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, the San Jose Mercury-News <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/12/concealed-guns-probe-new-records-further-suggest-influence-of-power-money-on-permitting-process/">reported</a> last week that four Apple security executives had obtained concealed weapon permits. Last month, the newspaper <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/24/spotty-records-may-hinder-das-investigation-into-how-santa-clara-county-grants-concealed-gun-permits/">reported</a> that a review of permit records it obtained from the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Department showed apparent favoritism toward well-connected applicants and a lack of guidelines on when the permits should be issued. The report quoted a law enforcement official as saying permit decisions were based solely on the views of Smith – the first woman county sheriff in California history – and her top aides. </p>
<p>But as a 2017 <a href="https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2017-101.pdf">report</a> by state Auditor Elaine Howle suggested, controversies like the current one in Santa Clara are close to inevitable because a century-old state law gives extraordinary discretion to county sheriffs and police chiefs in deciding which civilians get to carry a gun as they got about their lives.</p>
<p>The law says those applying for permits must demonstrate a “good cause” for a concealed weapon, must have “good moral character” and must complete a weapons-safety training course.</p>
<p>According to the San Francisco Chronicle, this flexibility has led to the issuing of zero concealed weapons permits in San Francisco, with a population of nearly 900,000, and to 2,300 winning approval in Solano County, with half the number of residents.</p>
<p>The state auditor wrote in 2017 that there was nothing inherently wrong with local governments having different standards and that she found no evidence of wrongdoing in the awarding of permits in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego counties, which were the focus of her review.</p>
<h4>CCW records often kept private for a year or more</h4>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped years of headlines and letters to the editor questioning sheriffs and police chiefs for their decisions on permits and their lack of transparency on the topic. Many agencies take a year or more in responding to requests for related public documents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prosecutors face roadblocks in proving that campaign donations are the equivalent of bribes, especially in cases that are years old. The case of former Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona illustrates this. In 2005, the Los Angeles Times reported that Carona – first elected in 1998 – had issued 86 badges to his early political supporters that allowed them to carry concealed weapons. In 2007, former Assistant Sheriff John Haidl testified in Carona’s criminal trial that the badge program was explicitly created to boost Carona’s political war chest. The case presented by prosecutors included <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2008/02/08/carona-wiretap-transcript-released/">recordings</a> of three conversations between Carona and Haidl in which Haidl wore a wire. The men talked about how to coordinate their stories to obstruct the federal probe of the badge program. </p>
<p>But in 2009, a jury found Carona guilty of only one felony count of witness tampering. Carona’s lawyers targeted the credibility of Haidl – a Newport Beach businessman with no law enforcement experience – and argued that the statute of limitations had expired on most of the charges against the former sheriff.</p>
<p>Carona was <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2011/01/25/ex-sheriff-carona-begins-5-year-sentence/">sentenced</a> to five and a half years in a federal prison.</p>

<p>The candidates for the Democratic Nomination to be President, especially those who lead, Like Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren need to do the right thing as the California presidential Primary approaches They need to learn about the LAPD Crime buster vigilante Scandal and reject the corrupt efforts of California Attorney General Becerra and Los Angeles Mayor, Eric Garcetti to stay totally silent and squash all crime buster vigilante investigation. Why? To protect LAPD Command officers who were members of the LAPD crime buster Vigilante Facebook group used to coordinate acts of terror and crimes of violence onto Los Angeles homeless population. It’s worse than President Trump’s corruption leading to Trumps impeachment because multiple homeless victims may be dead by induced suicide and outright violence, and even poisoning LAPD Crime buster Vigilantes have blood on their hands. Thus, no investigation by Becerra. California Attorney General Becerra is a corrupt Attorney General that will not do his job and investigate LAPD supported vigilante crime onto Los Angeles homeless. He is not be a good Progressive democrat like Congressman Shift or Nancy Pelosi. Becerra is two faced and lie to the public by refusing to investigate LAPD crime buster vigilante complaints. The LAPD calls most of the LA political shots and will do dirty, ugly criminal things to keep their power. They are racist and use Vigilantes on a homeless population that is 45 percent Black. The “Black Lives Matter” movement should be concerned about LAPD supported vigilante violence onto LA homeless. Attorney General Becerra empowers LAPD racism by giving them a free pass on the crime buster vigilante scandal. By Law the California Attorney General is required to gather California Hate Crimes Data.

“A very large share of people who are now homeless in California have been displaced from their homes when these real estate investment venture capitalists come in, buy up entire neighborhoods of relatively affordable homes and apartments and then build mega complexes of higher end and luxury homes. What is supposed to happen to these people who have service jobs paying minimum or less wages when their homes are demolished? The phrase “affordable housing “when uttered by most politicians in the context of this new era of redevelopment is a cruel and harmful, not to mention dangerous, joke. The ginormous bureaucracy and yes, the legislature itself, is in service of these vulture venture capitalist corporations and themselves. Look at any of the bureaucracies in the state, whether consumer affairs, public utilities, water boards, department of injustice &#8211; any of them &#8211; and point to one in service of citizens. Democrats or Republicans- makes zero difference..

<p>Thank you, California. Thanks for showing that it&#8217;s possible to govern a large, complex, multi-faceted state with compassion and intelligence. Thanks for showing us that it&#8217;s not necessary to vilify brown people and blame them for all of the problems facing us. Thanks for showing that even though there are great challenges that we all face, that rabid, fearful, and inhumane treatment is not required to face those challenges. Also, thanks very much for taking a different path than the Democratic position has been over the last few decades, which has consisted of attempting to remain above the fray, the higher moral ground, and then losing when the opposition resorts to outrageous tactics. Thanks for fighting, and showing us that fighting is something you just have do sometimes.<br />
