On Monday, the California Supreme Court issued a major ruling on the distinction between independent contractors (IC) and employees, establishing a new test for determining classification that presumes that workers are employees and not ICs.
The case, Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, dealt with a delivery service that classified its workers as ICs.
In an unexpected turn, the court established an entirely new test.
More broadly, the court also framed the issue as one of fairness, believing that denying employee status is harmful to a large swath of workers.
Companies have a substantial incentive to classify workers as ICs over employees, as they donâ€™t have to pay their social security or payroll taxes.
