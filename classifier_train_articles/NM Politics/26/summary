Our members participate in approving ACI’s policy agenda and learn from top leaders what business-related policies will be considered during the session.
ACI’s policy agenda informs our work during each legislative session, as well as ACI’s work with state and federal regulatory agencies throughout the year.
• Economic development and research & development: ACI supports full and increased investment in strategic economic development programs such as JTIP and LEDA, as well as enhancing the tools available to incentivize business investment and job creation.
• Health care: ACI supports maximization of federal funds through actions such as fully funding the state Medicaid program and Safety Net Care Pool.
• Legal reform: ACI supports forum-shopping limitations on choosing courts for filing of litigation in a jurisdiction perceived to be more favorable to the plaintiff.
