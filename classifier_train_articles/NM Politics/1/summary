New Mexico GOP Chair Steve Pearce (Heath Haussamen/NMPolitics.net)COMMENTARY: Former N.M. Gov.
With few exceptions, today’s GOP leaders are welcoming corruption into our government with open arms and displaying an impressively awful exercise in mental gymnastics to justify it.
But Trump’s corruption won’t only eat the Republican Party alive.
Because all the stuff New Mexico Republicans used to say about the evils of graft are true.
Pearce, now the chair of the New Mexico GOP, is a Trump apologist in a red MAGA cap.
