New Mexico State District Judge Sarah Singleton ruled recently in a lawsuit that the New Mexico public schools are not meeting the New Mexico Constitution’s standard of being sufficient.
In the 3,000 words of the New Mexico Constitution’s education section, the word “sufficient” is used only once without definition: “A uniform system of free public schools sufficient for the education of, and open to, all the children of school age in the state shall be established and maintained.”Judge Singleton does not define “sufficient” but gives the New Mexico Legislature until next April to make the public education system “sufficient” or suffer consequences.
If public schools this year had had more money, would different people have been hired?
The quickest fix is to lift more New Mexicans out of poverty with good jobs, but that is not the function of public schools.
I guess it means politicians can pour more money in and get more power out of public education.
