The department chose the site in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, according to the spokesperson.
The federal government will erect tents at the site to house immigrant children whose parents are facing prosecution for crossing the border illegally.
The Tornillo site will take in 360 children in the coming days and expand from there, according to the department spokesperson.
State and federal lawmakers from the El Paso area decried that proposal earlier this week, particularly raising concerns about housing children on military bases.
U.S. Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke, who represents El Paso, in a statement Thursday evening denounced the policy that created a need for the encampment in the first place.
