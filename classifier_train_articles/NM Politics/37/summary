COMMENTARY: I want to take a moment to clear up a few issues concerning New Mexicoâ€™s legislative retirement plan.
Our retirement plan is unique because New Mexico is unique.
The legislative retirement plan actually began in 1987 as part of the retirement system for all public employees.
The legislative retirement plan is currently funded at about 151 percent, meaning that money in the plan exceeds anticipated benefit payout by about half.
While I am open to making changes to the legislative retirement system, we must do so cautiously to avoid solvency issues further down the road.
