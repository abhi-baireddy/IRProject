The desperate sobbing of 10 Central American children, separated from their parents one day last week by immigration authorities at the border, makes for excruciating listening.
The children are initially held in warehouses, tents or big box stores that have been converted into Border Patrol detention facilities.
And the American Association of Pediatricians has said the practice of separating children from their parents can cause the children “irreparable harm.”Still, the administration had stood by it.
There are no laws that require children to be separated from their parents, or that call for criminal prosecutions of all undocumented border crossers.
They paid a smuggler $7,000 to guide them through Guatemala, and Mexico and across the border into the United States.
