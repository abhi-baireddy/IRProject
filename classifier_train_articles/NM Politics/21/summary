For example, grandparents raise young children, and single parents struggle to make paychecks stretch for another month.
Many great organizations, both state agencies and nonprofits, are hard at work addressing the major components of child development and care.
Organizations such as New Mexico Kids, Farm to Table New Mexico, the Brindle Foundation and New Mexico Voices for Children address a wide range of issues, such as early childhood education, food security and safe neighborhoods.
State agencies, including the Department of Healthâ€™s Families First program, the Children, Youth and Families Department and the Public Education Department labor diligently to meet the safety, health and educational needs of our families and children, often on shoestring budgets.
As the whole state works to strengthen and improve New Mexico families, those families will receive new hope.
