Here in New Mexico, abortion access has been solidly maintained by decades of activism by rights proponents and their collaborations with supportive elected officials.
Cowart said Planned Parenthood of New Mexico regularly treats women from as far away as North Dakota and Texas.
Vince Torres is executive director of the Family Policy Alliance of New Mexico, a local public policy arm of the national Family Policy Alliance.
Torres says concerns about negative outcomes for women when abortion access is curtailed distract from moral and Biblical imperatives to support pregnant women.
He added that local organizers opposed to abortion are “very concerned” about a possible repeal of New Mexico’s 1968 law criminalizing abortion.
