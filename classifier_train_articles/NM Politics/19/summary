On Aug. 8, federal District Judge Andrew Hanen will hear the state’s request to have the program preliminarily halted while the issue meanders its way through the federal court system.
The hearing comes nearly a year after President Donald Trump promised to end DACA in September by phasing it out over six months.
As of September there were about 120,000 DACA beneficiaries in Texas and more than 800,000 nationwide.
“There will need to be further court action.”That means that DACA’s fate could likely end up in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.
She said the Justice Department’s tepid defense of DACA could signal the administration’s hope that the Texas case will be the vehicle to take the issue before the Supreme Court.
