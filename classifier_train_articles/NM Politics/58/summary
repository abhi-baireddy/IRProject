That effectively says that children cannot be detained in immigration detention centers for more than 20 days, even if they are with their parents.
“Expanding family detention is not going to give Trump what he wants,” said Kevin Landy, who directed the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Office of Detention Policy and Planning under the Obama administration.
With the new federal policy and increased detention of families, he expects to see solicitations for new family centers.
“If DHS tries to build family detention facilities quickly and cheaply, the result will be awful,” Landy said.
But it’s unclear if family detention centers could be handled the same way.
