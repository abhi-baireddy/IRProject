Asked last week what steps they would take to reunite those families, federal officials demurred, saying they would leave it to the discretion of the federal judge who first ordered reunifications.
In the meantime, a host of nonprofit agencies and advocates have already mobilized in Central America to locate those parents.
In many cases, they are operating with minimal help from the government, which has been loath to turn over full case files on those migrant parents to legal advocates working to locate them.
At a court hearing on Friday, Department of Justice attorneys said the “onerous” process of providing detailed information about deported parents could siphon manpower away from other agency efforts.
But advocates working directly with migrant families say the standard for “eligibility” is neither fixed nor clearly explained.
