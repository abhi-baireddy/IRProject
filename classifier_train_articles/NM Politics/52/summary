NMPolitics.net has been awarded a $5,000 grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism to examine Southern New Mexicoâ€™s inadequate behavioral health system and explore solutions.
The grant was one of 14 the Fund awarded in November to journalists across the planet.
The news organization operates as a small business, not a nonprofit, so winning grant funding from foundations is challenging.
For example, the area is still working to recover from the 2013 Medicaid funding freeze that hampered longtime area nonprofits that were providing behavioral health services.
The Fund for Investigative Journalism has awarded more than $1.5 million to freelance journalists, authors and small publications over three decades, according to its website.
