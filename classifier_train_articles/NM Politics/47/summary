COMMENTARY: I want to thank the legislators, editorial writers, higher education colleagues at NMSU and in New Mexico, and private citizens who have expressed their confidence in my leadership of NMSU and their hope the Board of Regents would extend my contract for another two years.
I also believe when you are a public servant, you need to be as open to the public as possible.
For that reason, it has become clear to me the best way to serve NMSU, and ensure its growth and stability, is to be more forthcoming about my decision to announce my retirement.
However, in a meeting on August 1, the Regents made it known to me that, although they appreciated the strong leadership I have exerted over the course of the past four years, they did not intend to extend my contract.
While I am grateful for the outpouring of support, I recognize the decision about the extension of my contract belongs to the Regents.
