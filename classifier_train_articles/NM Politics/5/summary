Just over 10,000 people voted in the last mayoral race in Las Cruces in 2015.
But the Las Cruces Public Schools easily won approval to continue a property tax on Tuesday.
That reminds me of what I observed happen on an infrastructure level when Las Cruces redesigned its downtown.
Immediately after Las Cruces built a space for such gatherings, people filled it for a Christmas event and then the 2017 womenâ€™s march.
It took a lot of work over several years to enact complex election reform in Las Cruces and New Mexico, but we did it.
