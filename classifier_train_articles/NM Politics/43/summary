“Had I run against you, you probably would have beat me.”Richardson was speaking during a ceremony to honor Domenici at the Domenici Public Policy Conference at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.
Richardson said he went to Domenici — then the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee — to inform him of his appointment.
“I wish he would use ‘proper power,’” Domenici said.
“I hope that for every Democrat I inspired that there was at least a Republican,” Domenici said in response.
It’s part of The Pete V. Domenici Legacy, a statewide effort led by NMSU to honor the senator’s historic tenure.
