U.S. Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (Courtesy photo)COMMENTARY: I’m old enough to remember when Republicans complained about corruption during Bill Richardson’s tenure as governor.
I understand why my congresswoman, Democrat Xochitl Torres Small, remains on the fence, for now one of a handful of House Democrats who aren’t supporting the impeachment inquiry.
Torres Small is the first woman and person of color to represent my congressional district.
The political calculation is more complex for Torres Small, whose 2018 victory was a surprise to many.
The Republicans Trump hasn’t chased out of Congress usually back him uniformly, often in defiance of morality and even logic.
