U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., spoke on Thursday about the civility and respect that is sorely lacking in Washington today.
They agreed on most points, but Domenici told Dodd he thought it would be more difficult to convince Russia to leave Georgia than Dodd suggested.
“I love this man and I care about him very deeply,” Dodd told the approximately 200 people in attendance.
“That’s what Pete Domenici brings.”Dodd cited the Character Counts program in schools as one fruit of Domenici’s civility and respect.
Dodd told Domenici he hopes the proposal will receive the final approval of Congress before the end of the year.
