That’s why I sued the N.M. Spaceport Authority, the state agency that runs the spaceport, in August 2018.
My lawsuit has led to some significant victories:• The spaceport recently released fully unredacted copies of the leases.
It was about getting public information to you.
It may give the spaceport leeway to redact information from lease agreements again.
File a public records request under the new law for all leases the spaceport has with clients.
