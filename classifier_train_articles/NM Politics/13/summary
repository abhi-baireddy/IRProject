Heath Haussamen / NMPolitics.netCOMMENTARY: I’m relieved that President Donald Trump has agreed to stop separating immigrant children from their parents.
Trump took kids from their parents, locked them up and let the world know we’ll do the same to other children.
These actions are symptoms of oppressive systems we’ve built over generations.
Clearly, the systems and beliefs we as a nation have supported from our genesis are alive and well.
Going forward, we must fight with the same zeal and unity to dismantle oppressive systems and stop unjust actions by our government regardless of which political party is in charge.
