NMPolitics.net has a policy requiring that we correct inaccuracies.
In accordance with that policy, here’s a correction to the article, “Embattled Vasquez resigns from Doña Ana County Commission.”A prior version of this article incorrectly stated that the person the governor appoints to fill Vasquez’s seat will serve until the current term expires in 2020.
In fact, that person will serve until the end of the year, and the position will be on the ballot in this year’s election.
