In 2022, conservancy districts would be added to the consolidated elections.
Beginning in 2019, consolidated elections would be held the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November during odd-numbered years.
Municipalities that don’t join the consolidated elections would have to hold their elections in March in odd-numbered years.
AdvertisementThe bill creates unique choices for Albuquerque and Las Cruces because they don’t currently hold elections in March.
Other local governments like school districts that would be required to join consolidated elections would be subject to the state’s elections code, which does not require a photo ID to vote.
