COMMENTARY: The irony that this post will be shared on Facebook isnâ€™t missed on me, but hear me out.
Every state in the country provides tax incentives to corporations for economic development, but public leaders rarely scrutinize the return of this investment to their community.
The reason being that state and local taxes, as a share of total business costs, play too small a role in location decisions.
Investing in what New Mexicans need is the same as investing in what corporations need.
