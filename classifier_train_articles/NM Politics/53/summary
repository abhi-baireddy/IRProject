Rather than talk about “right-sizing” or further cutting government, legislators must adequately fund essential services such as our courts.
A modest step toward adequate funding the judiciary is to require that at least 3 percent of the state’s annual budget be allocated for court operations.
That belt-tightening includes keeping court staff positions vacant, lowering juror pay and reducing the mileage reimbursements for travel by jurors, judges and all court employees.
New Mexicans can expect fewer services and further reductions in court business hours if the judiciary must absorb additional budget cuts.
Timely access to justice and a properly functioning court system benefits everyone.
