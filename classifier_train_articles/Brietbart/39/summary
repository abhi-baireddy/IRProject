When Wine Country Marines President James Brown heard that members of his community were running out of hand sanitizer this week, he decided to do something about it, according to ABC 7.
The director of the VA Palo Alto made a donation.
We gave the East Palo Alto Police Department some, they were on their last few bottles that were just in their patrol cars.
Following his stop at the distillery, Brown delivered sanitizer to patients and staff at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System.
Once Brown delivered the sanitizer, Fitzgerald expressed his gratitude a second time and said he knew how deeply the Marine veteran wanted to help others.
