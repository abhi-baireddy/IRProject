Friday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) accused President Donald Trump of “not rising to this challenge,” while discussing his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mitchell said, “Let’s talk about the terrible spike of deaths in New Jersey this week, passing 3,000 — the testing shortage.
Here you’ve got the mayor now —rather, the president telling mayors and governors it’s up to you.
This is a president who is not assuming his moral authority that we really need him to do, not doing the levels of coordination and rationalizing of resources in our country, not rising to this challenge.
But as we found out when he tried to assume constitutional powers he does not have, governors make the decisions.
