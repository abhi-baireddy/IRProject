Hong Kong’s new fire chief Joseph Leung on Wednesday dismissed criticism that he referred to pro-democracy protesters as “cockroaches” during a lecture at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy in October.
“The streets are unsafe because there are a lot of cockroaches, if you film them, they will hit you,” Leung said during the speech.
The South China Morning Post on Friday talked with lawyer Antony Dapiran, author of a book on the 2019 movement called City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.
For its part, Beijing can write off its political and economic losses from 2019, and perhaps even write off a generation of Hong Kong youth as “lost” to communism, while considering its long-term objectives for the island secure.
The protesters did not get all of their “Five Demands,” so Beijing and its operatives in the Hong Kong executive may conclude that stubborn intransigence worked for them.
