House Democrats revived the specter of impeachment for President Donald Trump if he moves forward with his order to defund the communist China-influenced World Health Organization (W.H.O.)
The president does not have the unilateral authority to withhold the United States’ assessed contribution to the World Health Organization.
House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) also blasted Trump’s plans to stop funding to the W.H.O.
as “petty, counterproductive political games.”Need more proof that President Trump's illegal withholding of World Health Organization funding puts Americans at risk?
Director Tedros told reporters the U.N. agency regrets Trump’s decision to halt funding.
