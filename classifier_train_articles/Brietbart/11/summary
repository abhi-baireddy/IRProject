For the third consecutive year, the majority of Truman Scholarships were awarded to leftist students.
Only four of the 62 recipients of the 2020 Truman Scholarship identified as politically conservative in their applications.
Breitbart News reported last year that the Truman Scholarship was awarded to zero conservative students in 2018.
Truman Foundation Executive Secretary Dr. Terry Babcock-Lumish said that the foundation does not require scholarship applicants to provide their political affiliation.
“The Truman Foundation is committed to identifying aspiring public service leaders throughout the United States,” Babcock-Lumish said.
