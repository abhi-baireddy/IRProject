NBA players will see 25% of their paychecks taken out starting May 15, the first direct hit to their salaries because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The regular season would have ended Wednesday, and 259 games have yet to be played — but none have been officially called off yet.
“Through this agreement, and in order to provide players with a more gradual salary reduction schedule, partial reductions of 25% will begin with the players’ twice-a-month payment due on May 15,” the NBA said in a news release.
If none of the 259 outstanding regular season games are played, the league’s players would lose about $800 million in gross salary.
By taking some money out now, the hit the players take later if games are canceled would be lessened.
