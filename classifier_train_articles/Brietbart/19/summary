During an interview with “The Jeff Poor Show” on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Sessions warned of the dangers of continuing with the status quo of a shutdown.
“I would just simply say this: We do need to get back to work,” Sessions said.
I think they’ll be far more willing to wear masks and take other actions to keep social distance, even at the job site.
I think maybe we can do that without much increase of infection.
“I think we’ve got to get away from these blanket rules and get back to doing what’s reasonable and what we can do to be successful,” he added.
