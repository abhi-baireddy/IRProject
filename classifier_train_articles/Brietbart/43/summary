Chinese police raided the homes of members of the Early Rain Covenant Church on Easter Sunday, arresting six church leaders for participating in an online religious service via Zoom.
Early Rain Covenant Church was first raided during a Sunday evening service in December 2018 after authorities claimed it violated religious regulations because it was not registered with the government.
Last Sunday’s worship service began at 9:30 a.m. and included a taped sermon given by imprisoned Pastor Wang Yi, which apparently sparked the raids.
Chinese officials have reportedly vandalized other churches and ordered a ban on “unregistered” religious services on the grounds of public health.
In February, the Religious Affairs Bureau of the northeastern province of Jilin issued a document calling on authorities to “rectify” house churches, which the government deems illegal.
