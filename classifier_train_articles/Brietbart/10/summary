Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday at the White House that there were more than enough coronavirus tests available for states to begin phase one of reopening the country.
Fauci explained to reporters that although testing was important, it was just one part of the overall strategy to fight the coronavirus.
Dr. Fauci explained that a test for coronavirus would only be of value for one day, pointing out that any person could subsequently contract the disease.
The antibody tests, she said, were currently being used for first responders and health care workers to see how they performed in the field.
There were plenty of tests available, Fauci said, adding it was an ongoing fight to make sure they were available.
