President Donald Trump sent a series of messages on Twitter to Democrats on Friday, demanding they start lifting state lockdowns after the coronavirus has hit its peak.
“Liberate Minnesota, Liberate Michigan, Liberate Virginia,” Trump wrote on Twitter, pointing to Democrat governors who still had their states locked down.
“Governor Cuomo should spend more time “doing” and less time “complaining,” Trump wrote.
“Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers,” Trump wrote.
“It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!” he wrote.
