An illegal alien MS-13 Gang member accused of murdering a 14-year-old girl in Marietta, Georgia, was previously freed into the United States interior after arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Segura allegedly admitted to murdering Valenzuela as part of his initiation into the MS-13 gang, alleging that the girl was a member of the rival 18th Street Gang.
The UAC program is widely used by the MS-13 gang to import illegal alien members into the U.S.
Annually, about 22,000 potential recruits for the MS-13 gang are resettled throughout the country by the federal government.
The MS-13 gang originated in El Salvador and has used the U.S. immigration system to slowly build up its membership.
