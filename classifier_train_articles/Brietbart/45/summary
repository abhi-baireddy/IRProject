President Donald Trump said Friday at the White House that the United States would continue to investigate the origin of the coronavirus.
Recent reporting has questioned whether the virus could have come from a virology lab in Wuhan that was studying bats, rather than a bat sold in a Wuhan wet market.
Trump did not confirm or deny either theory but acknowledged that he was aware of the reports.
Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson asked Trump about an NIH grant of $3.7 million to the Wuhan virology lab, during the Obama administration in 2015.
He added, “Who was president then, I wonder?”One reporter asked Dr. Fauci if the virus “was somehow manmade” in a lab.
