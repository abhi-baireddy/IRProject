Police in the Colombian city of Quibdó attempted to promote social distancing and other Chinese coronavirus safety measures this week by recreating a popular African dancing pallbearer meme.
“It is recommended, for your health and that of your family, try to stay at home,” said the officer on the megaphone.
The original video of dancing pallbearers originated in Ghana, where mourners would hire groups of well-dressed men to carry the coffin while singing and dancing to upbeat music.
Chocó is one of Colombia’s regions with the largest Afro-descended populations, as well as the most affected by the county’s decades-long armed conflict.
According to latest figures, Colombia has so far recorded 3,450 cases of the coronavirus and 319 deaths.
