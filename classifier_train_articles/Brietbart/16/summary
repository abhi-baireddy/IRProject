The Danish government has set up a new return office within the Ministry of Immigration and Integration aimed at increasing the number of deportations of migrants without residency permits.
The office, named the Home Travel Agency, is scheduled to begin work on August 1st.
The Home Travel Agency will cover the estimated 1,100 rejected asylum seekers believed to be residing in Denmark currently, according to a government press release.
â€œNow, we set up the Home Travel Agency to ensure that people also return home when they no longer have the right to be in Denmark.
In neighbouring Sweden, some fear that many migrants set for removal will have to be released as laws do not allow authorities to hold them indefinitely.
