Scott said, “As I talk to CEOs of hospitals around South Carolina, what they say they need is the ability to go back to work.
They’re not doing procedures.
Hospitals are sitting empty, and they’re not able to do the work.
If the PPE, the personal protection equipment, is not a concern, we should allow hospitals to start re-engaging and doing those things that are profitable.
And then we can provide some additional funding on top of that.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
