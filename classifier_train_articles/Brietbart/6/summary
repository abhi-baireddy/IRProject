Andrew Cuomo complained at a press conference on Friday that everything the state needed to fight the coronavirus was made in China, which should be a strong wakeup call for leaders in the United States.
“We need masks, they’re made in China; we need gowns, they’re made in China; we need face shields, they’re made in China; we need ventilators, they’re made in China.”Cuomo expressed relief that most of their immediate equipment needs had finally been met but noted that much needed chemical agents for testing were also made in China.
“I don’t do China relations, I don’t do international supply chain, and that’s where the federal government can help,” he said.
“The federal government cannot wipe their hands of this and say the states are responsible for testing,” he said.
“We cannot do it without federal help.”
