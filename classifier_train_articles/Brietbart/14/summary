The strict review and correction of the death toll means there is no room for deliberate concealment.
Speculation that China falsified the death toll from the coronavirus is far from truth.
But some people have questioned the number of COVID-19 deaths in China for political reasons and politicized the data.
As the first country that launched a nationwide mobilization against the novel coronavirus, even a relatively low death toll would be viewed as a big number.
A statistical system was eventually set up, but underreporting the death toll would benefit nobody.
