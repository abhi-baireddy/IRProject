A Florida kennel at an animal shelter is empty for the first time in history since all of its dogs were adopted.
Volunteers at the Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control cheered in front of empty dog cages in celebration.
According to the organization, the kennel is just one out of three at the facility, which usually houses strays and overflows from the adoption kennel.
Friends of Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control said that animals are still available to be adopted at the facility, including two cats, two horses, and a pig.
For those interested in adopting, you can see the most up-to-date information on Palm Beach Animal Controlâ€™s website.
