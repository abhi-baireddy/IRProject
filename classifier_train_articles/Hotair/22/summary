This hasn’t gotten much attention in the U.S. media before now, but one result of the coronavirus outbreak in China has been a wave of anti-foreigner sentiment.
State media in China has been reporting the number of “imported cases” of coronavirus every day.
It’s interesting that China has its own social justice warriors called “little pinks.” Maybe we should adopt that name for them here.
The CCP cranks out stuff like this to fool gullible foreign media, e.g.
U.S. media outlets, some of whom have taken to publishing “news stories” based on obvious Chinese propaganda.
