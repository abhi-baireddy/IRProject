That’s no joke, either; some had guesstimated that it might take several months to get the payments out in the fashion determined by Congress.
The cash hasn’t shown up yet for a lot of Americans in either checks or direct deposit form, and some are beginning to wonder why.
You must have also received a refund in those years via direct deposit to get the money delivered automatically.
The IRS is not using bank account information it may have used to withdraw from your account if you owed money.
That might be a point of confusion for other Americans too, who might assume (as I did) that the IRS would use the direct deposit information regardless of which direction the money flowed with it previously.
