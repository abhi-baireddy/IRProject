I fear that many of my co-workers are so high on recognition and glorification, they can’t see the real danger they’re in.
I’m afraid that when a grocery-store worker does fall ill, the measures taken in response might lack transparency.
When the world isn’t falling apart, we know the view of us is usually as faceless, throwaway citizens.
The anger I have is not toward my boss, or my boss’s boss, or even that guy’s boss.
It’s toward an unfair system that will never change if we workers don’t question the motivations behind such mythmaking.
