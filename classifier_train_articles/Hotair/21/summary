pic.twitter.com/uWNI7DCG3oSeveral news outlets have rushed to defend Pelosi including FactCheck.org and the San Francisco Chronicle.
Fact Check points out that there’s no evidence Pelosi ever deleted video about her Chinatown visit from Twitter.
Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown… So, that’s why we want people to come to Chinatown.
So things were starting to get serious but obviously Pelosi wasn’t championing social distancing at that point.
The first counties to shut down were the ones in the Bay Area including San Francisco.
