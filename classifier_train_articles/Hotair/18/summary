In my post yesterday I compared the sample of “severe” patients in Chicago to a sample of British patients receiving “critical” care.
In China (where they weren't all getting Remdesivir), ZERO severe cases died?
And now in the US out of 113 patients with "severe" covid19 getting the drug, and TWO patients died.
Critical patients are at death’s door; severe patients are, well, they’re having a bad time of it but they’re not at the ICU stage yet.
The CFR was 49.0% among critical cases.” Patients who needed a ventilator were actually excluded from the Chicago study.
