Last week I wrote about a doctor who serves as the medical director of a nursing home in Texas City, Texas testing hydroxychloroquine on a group of elderly patients.
At the time, I wrote that he was treating 30 patients with hydroxychloroquine.
Now it is being reported that 39 elderly people gave Armstrong permission to treat them with hydroxychloroquine.
The drug is routinely used to combat malaria and is used by lupus patients, too.
Hydroxychloroquine helps her live with lupus, but she says the pills have become harder for her to find since some doctors began using them for coronavirus patients.
