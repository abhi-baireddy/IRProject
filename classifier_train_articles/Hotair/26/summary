Of course, I don’t remember the last time I read a story about former Blink 182 frontman Tom DeLonge that didn’t wind up diving down one rabbit hole or another.
This week, Tom did an interview with two DJs on radio station 91X in San Diego.
He then went further, claiming that the Department of Defense established its own program where they found people who could replicate the experiment.
Tom DeLonge: Yeah, so they repeated the experiment in the Department of Defense.
If DeLonge actually has one of the latter types in his possession he almost undoubtedly received it from Elizondo or one of his associates.
