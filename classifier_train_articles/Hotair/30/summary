Four days ago Bill Bennett compared the annual flu death toll to the projected coronavirus death toll in wondering why we don’t shut down the country every year to stop the flu.
Carry on as normal and there’s every reason to believe the death toll between this disease and the flu would diverge spectacularly.
Comparing deaths from one highly contagious disease during a lockdown to deaths from another without a lockdown is idiotic, and willfully so.
Ingraham did a little better in her interview with Fauci earlier in the program, wanting to know why we didn’t shut down the country to contain HIV or SARS.
Ingraham’s attitude seems to be “If we didn’t shut down for HIV then we can’t properly shut down now,” regardless of whether it’s necessary or not to avoid a freakish death toll.
