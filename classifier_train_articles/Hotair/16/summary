Right now, everything we know about the Wuhan Institute of Virology indicates it is a research laboratory that was studying coronaviruses in the name of health research.
The original SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 had more than 5,300 cases in China and killed 349 people.
It is entirely natural and expected that Chinese health officials and doctors would want to know more about coronaviruses, to be prepared to fight some future outbreak.
But this is not to say that Chinese government has no interest in biological weapons.
What it means is that the Chinese governmentâ€™s interest in and enthusiasm for researching contagious viruses may not be entirely driven by altruistic reasons.
