But if I’m not mistaken, no antibody study of a regional or national population anywhere in the world has shown prevalence higher than around five percent so far.
If any place on Earth could produce big numbers in antibody testing, you would think it’d be a hospital in Wuhan.
A higher prevalence rate in Wuhan could also be exploited by China for propaganda.
Recent testing in Denmark of health-care workers, among whom you might expect much higher prevalence, found just 4.1 percent infected.
There might be much higher prevalence in a group like that than across the entire city.
