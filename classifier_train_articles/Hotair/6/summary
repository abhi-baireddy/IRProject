Many dual-breadwinner families struggle to afford child care but have no realistic alternatives.
These professional caregivers tend to be women, who in turn must find (often lower-quality) child care for their own children and parents while they provide bespoke care for the children or parents of the more well-to-do.
In 1940, 25 percent of Americans lived in multigenerational homes.
But it has been climbing since, reaching 18 percent in 2012, largely powered by economic necessity after the Great Recession.
While multigenerational living is increasing and might continue to increase during our present economic crisis, the isolation of older generations remains the cultural norm.
