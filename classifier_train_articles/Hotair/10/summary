#NotTheFlu — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) April 17, 2020The infection fatality rate for the flu is around 0.1 percent.
If ev-uh-ree-one in NYC was infected, which of course they aren’t, the fatality rate would be around .14 percent.
And all of this assumes that we’re counting deaths from COVID in New York City and beyond more or less accurately, without missing many.
