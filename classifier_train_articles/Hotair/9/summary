Trump went after governors in Virginia, Michigan, and Minnesota over their shelter-in-place regimens, although Trump had another bone to pick with Ralph Northam in the Old Dominion:LIBERATE MICHIGAN!
This follows a similar order from Wisconsin’ Tony Evers that opened golf courses yesterday, before Trump tweeted his “liberate” message.
Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases.
Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category).
Trump has lots of reasons to go after Northam and Whitmer, but the attack on Walz is strange indeed.
