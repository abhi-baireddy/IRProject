Clyburn endorsed Biden at the eleventh hour, bringing along big support from African-American voters in South Carolina, which Biden desperately needed to win.
These are the people Clyburn says can do outreach for the Biden campaign in black communities across the United States.
Clyburn says there is no time to waste, that the Biden campaign has to begin making serious efforts in getting out the vote now.
According to an NBC News exit poll, Biden received 61% of the black vote in the South Carolina primary.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake for the Biden campaign from super PACs and politically motivated non-profits.
