The lack of regular White House press briefings used to be decried as the end of democracy.
Now it’s daily White House briefings that represent the end of democracy.
Actress Jane Lynch demanded on Twitter on Monday that President Donald Trump end his daily press briefings and that the media stop covering them.
New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet explained why the Gray Lady doesn’t find the White House briefings worth covering.
The bottom line is that neither the reduction, nor the uptick, in White House press conferences signals the end of democracy.
