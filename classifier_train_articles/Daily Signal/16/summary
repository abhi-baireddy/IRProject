Virginia Allen: When the coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, the Chinese Communist Party tried to cover it up.
Unfortunately, Dr. Li actually ended up dying of coronavirus himself.
Could you just explain a little bit about how the Chinese really operate and is this behavior really in alignment with what we have seen from Chinaâ€™s party before?
So this is very typical of China and the Chinese Communist Party likes to maintain a tight grip on information.
What we started to see was that the Chinese Communist Party was essentially making them disappear.
