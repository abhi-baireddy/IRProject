Roger Scruton has died.
He wrote about conservative political philosophy and Western civilization with erudition and grace, and was a trenchant critic of leftist thought.
But Scruton also wrote about other aspects of philosophy, aesthetics, art, music, architecture, literature, conservation and environmentalism, religion, sexual desire, hunting, and wine.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted, “RIP Sir Roger Scruton.
We have lost the greatest modern conservative thinker – who not only had the guts to say what he thought but said it beautifully.”RIP Sir Roger Scruton.
