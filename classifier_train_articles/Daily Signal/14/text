Jeanne Safer, author of the new book “I Love You, but I Hate Your Politics,” joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss how we can maintain relationships with friends and family despite political differences.

Safer, a psychologist, should know: While liberal herself, she has long been married to National Review senior editor Richard Brookhiser.

“Never start any conversation with, ‘How could you possibly think … ‘” Safer explains, “even if you’re not shouting. Or, ‘Did you hear the obnoxious tweet or the stupid thing this person said?’ These are not conversation starters, they are insults. And your partner, the person you care about, will interpret them that way.”

Plus, we cover these news stories:

The Heritage Foundation’s Nick Loris dispels some environmental myths.

We share letters about last week’s episode, “She Survived China’s Forced Labor Camp. Now She’s Urging Americans to Reject Socialism.”

We tell the story of how one man created a very simple way for prison inmates to stay connected with their families during incarceration.
