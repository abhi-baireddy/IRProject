The mayor of a Northern California city this week announced plans to step down after outrage erupted over recent social media posts comparing President Donald Trump’s supporters to members of the Ku Klux Klan, Fox News reported.
The angry Auburn community, about 33 miles northeast of Sacramento, weighed in on Mayor William Kirby’s controversial comments on Facebook during a virtual City Council meeting by video Monday.
“I spent 40 years dedicating my life to serving the community of Auburn as a physician and through my volunteer efforts.
We’re all a little flawed,” Kirby said, admitting some of his recent posts were misguided.
“The president has put us all at risk.”In one of the posts, the mayor shared a photo of a Ku Klux Klan hood, with the caption, “Good news for Trump supporters is that most of them already have masks,” the report said.
