In fact, South Korea’s response to the coronavirus outbreak has been exemplary.
Once a recipient of U.S. aid, South Korea has become one of the most dynamic free-market democracies in the world.
According to The Heritage Foundation’s annual Index of Economic Freedom, which measures a country’s overall business environment, South Korea is ranked 25th in the world as a “mostly free” economy.
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic surely qualifies and highlights the tremendous value of forward-looking alliances.
Throughout many trying and challenging times over the past several decades, South Korea has demonstrated its willingness and capacity to be a true ally for America.
