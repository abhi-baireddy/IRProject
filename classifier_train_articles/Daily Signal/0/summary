The media tell us China “beat coronavirus.” I don’t believe it.
The American Enterprise Institute’s Derek Scissors argues that the Chinese have underreported the number of COVID-19 cases by millions.
Most of us in America now practice “social distancing.” I’ve barely left my house in a month.
China’s spying on people to create “social trust” scores is an example of it.
“The control of people’s mind, people’s mouth, people’s pen never stopped.”That’s something to think about now in America, when so many politicians are eager to do more.
