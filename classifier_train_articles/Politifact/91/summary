But U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who has represented a suburban Milwaukee district in Congress since 1979, claimed that more than 100 Democrats took an earlier vote to impeach.
On Dec. 11, 2019, Sensenbrenner tweeted an image that read: "104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place."
The third vote took place just days before the Ukraine call, on July 17, 2019.
His spokesman, Krepich, argued a "no" vote on postponing the bills equals a vote to proceed on impeachment.
