Joy Behar, a co-host of ABC’s "The View," accused President Donald Trump of dismantling anti-pandemic programs the Obama administration set up across the globe.
"The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries," Behar said.
The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC "to support national public health institutes and global health security."
It’s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump "shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs" was debunked by other fact-checkers.
