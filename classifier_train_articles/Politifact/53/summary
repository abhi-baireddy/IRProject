Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White hearkened to a moment we’ve reviewed before when White told delegates to the Texas Democratic Party’s convention in Corpus Christi June 25: “In Rick Perry’s Texas, the governor threatens to leave, to secede from the greatest country in the” world.
Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas.
Using the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles linking Perry and secede.
What we find: In a politically theatrical moment, Perry edged toward a secession threat.
Then or since, however, he hasn’t said Texas should quit the United States.
