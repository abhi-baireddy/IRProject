President Barack Obama is a Christian, but that doesn’t stop people from saying he’s a Muslim.

"I don't believe the guy is a Christian," Sabato said.
A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein.
