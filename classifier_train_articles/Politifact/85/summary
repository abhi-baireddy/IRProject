But his larger claim, that wages haven’t moved much in the last three decades, is on point.
And what about his underlying point: that real wages haven’t changed much in 30 years?
Fast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour.
He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant.
So, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods.
