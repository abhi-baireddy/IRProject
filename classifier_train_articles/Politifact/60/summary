A chain email claims "dhimmitude" is on page 107 of the health care law, and it means Muslims will be exempt from the health care law.
We don’t want to keep you in suspense, so we’ll tell it to you straight: The word "dhimmitude" is not in the health care law.
It's on page 107 of the health care bill.
The email goes on to claim that the health law specifically exempts Muslims.
The health care law has a general exception for religious conscience (see page 128).
