Posts around the nation warn people not to open their doors to imposters who say they are doing coronavirus testing but actually want to rob the residents.

Many social media users respond to news that brings "high levels of anxiety and fear," said Niklas Myhr, a marketing and economics professor at Chapman University in Orange, California, who calls himself the social media professor.
The algorithms of social media platforms "quickly pick up on signals of content being engaging and makes it more available in broader circles," Myrh said.
