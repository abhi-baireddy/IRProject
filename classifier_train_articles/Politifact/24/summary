For those who get their health insurance from an employer, losing a job means losing health benefits, too.
The group Public Citizen, a progressive think tank that advocates for universal health care, tweeted April 4, 2020 that 3.5 million Americans lost employer-tied health insurance in March.
For most countries, itâ€™s an easy answer: Being employed and having health insurance are not tied together nearly as often, because the countries have universal health care.
In Chile, those who do not have private insurance are automatically enrolled in government-provided health insurance.
Meanwhile, the other countries listed each utilize a universal or government-provided health insurance model, meaning citizens there are not at risk of losing their health insurance if they lose their job.
