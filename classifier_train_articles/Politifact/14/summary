Contact tracing has been used to slow the spread of other diseases, such as SARS and HIV.
Contact tracing involves identifying and alerting people who may have come in contact with an infected person to prevent them from unknowingly spreading the virus.

Having adequate personnel and resources is one of the big hurdles to rolling out contact tracing across the country.
