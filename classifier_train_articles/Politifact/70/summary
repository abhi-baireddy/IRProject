A $600-per-week federal boost in unemployment payments means some unemployed workers will receive the equivalent of $24 an hour, but that depends on how much their state pays for basic unemployment benefits.
The federal stimulus bill in response to the coronavirus outbreak does not specify unemployment payments be made at a rate equivalent to $24 per hour.
Furthermore, the stimulus does not boost pay for people still on the job, including essential workers who earn less than $24 per hour.
In addition, the law gives a $600-per-week boost in unemployment payments, meaning that some recipients will receive payments equivalent to a $24 hourly rate.
However, the law does not specify that weekly unemployment payments be the equivalent of $24 per hour.
