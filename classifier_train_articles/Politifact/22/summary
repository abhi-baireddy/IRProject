The spread of the novel coronavirus has put President Donald Trump on TV screens across the nation as the White House task force gives regular press briefings on the U.S. response.
But Trump never said that "people are dying who have never died before," despite what a number of social media posts have claimed.
One Facebook post, which said Trump made the comment on March 18, was flagged as part Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
Nor did we find any deleted Trump tweets on Politwoops, a database of deleted political tweets maintained by ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism organization.
We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!
