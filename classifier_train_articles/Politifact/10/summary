We’ve previously checked claims about President Donald Trump’s stance on the law’s preexisting condition protections — arguably its most popular component ― and his position on the Texas v. Azar lawsuit.
Since then, the White House and congressional Republicans have pursued an agenda that would dismantle the law’s preexisting condition protections.
That measure took the teeth out of the health law’s individual mandate, which required that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.
A collection of Republican states’ attorneys general now argue that, without the penalty, the rest of the health law doesn’t work and should be struck down.
