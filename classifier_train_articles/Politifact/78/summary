There are hospitals with significant numbers of empty beds — but not because of a conspiracy that exaggerates the coronavirus outbreak.
But that’s due largely to hospitals keeping beds empty as they prepare for an expected influx of patients who have COVID-19 disease.
The U.S. has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared with 3.2 in Italy and 4.3 in China.
Again, there are examples of hospitals with empty beds, but the key reason is that they are clearing out space to treat coronavirus patients.
"It's only because we've canceled elective procedures to prepare for a surge of coronavirus patients," he said.
