"We've had examples like in Yuma County where we've been able to stop 97 percent of the illegal flow, and those programs, they abolish," Carson added.
The closest thing we could find was a federal program aimed at prosecuting illegal immigrants that was scaled back, but not abolished.
"This practice undermines everything that we have worked hard to achieve over the years for the citizens of Yuma County," Wilmot wrote.
Our rulingCarson said that Yuma County has been able to reduce illegal immigration by 97 percent, but that the federal programs that allowed them to do that had been "abolished."
So while Carson has a point that illegal immigration has fallen significantly in Yuma County, he glosses over the time frame and incorrectly credits a program that was scaled back but not abolished.
