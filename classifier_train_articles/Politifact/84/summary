But online, people continue to share a list of 44 U.S. senators — 42 Democrats and two Independents — who social media posts claim "voted NOT to send stimulus checks."
The post is wrong: On March 25, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of the stimulus package.
The measure then passed the House on a voice vote, and President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on March 27.
Policy disagreements led 47 senators to block the bill from moving forward in a procedural vote on March 22.
Under the bipartisan bill that ultimately became law, Americans earning up ro $75,000 will receive payments of $1,200.
