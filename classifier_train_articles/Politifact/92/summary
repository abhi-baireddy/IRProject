Amid a shortage of face masks, the Centers for Disease Control Prevention now recommends all U.S. residents wear face coverings in public places.
People are going door to door handing out masks.
Searching for more information about robbers handing out compromised face masks, however, we found no other news stories covering such reports.
Certainly, there is criminal activity connected to face masks.
There are no credible reports of people handing out masks doused with chemicals so they can rob passed-out victims.
