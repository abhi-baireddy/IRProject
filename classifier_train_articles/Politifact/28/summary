The video is actually a scene from the 2007 TV miniseries, “Pandemic.”A widespread Facebook post wrongly claims that a video of body bags being dumped in a ditch shows the “situation in Italy” due to the novel coronavirus.
A video viewed thousands of times on Facebook wrongly claims that footage of body bags being dumped in a ditch shows the "situation in Italy" due to the novel coronavirus.
In the video, body bags roll down the slope of a hill and into a ditch.
Fact-checkers in India and France matched the visual of the body bags and the audio of the voice in the clip to a scene from "Pandemic."
The actual scene from "Pandemic" shows a fictional reporter broadcasting about the so-called "riptide virus" as the body bags are seen tumbling.
