Wisconsin removed hundreds of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2017 and 2018 through routine purges, one of which involved faulty technology that was corrected.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar missed the mark when she tried using Wisconsin to make a point about voter suppression.
Klobuchar’s campaign said she was referring to voter purges in 2017 and 2018 — not those at the center of the lawsuit.
As we noted, Wisconsin is currently in the throes of a controversy over its voter rolls.
In December 2019, an Ozaukee County judge sided with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and ordered the election commission to remove those people from the voter rolls.
