MSNBC corrected the error on air and on Twitter.

This is bad math. $500 million divided by 327 million people would be roughly $1.53 per person, not $1 million.

MSNBC anchor Brian Williams aired a tweet during his TV show that said former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who self-funded his since-suspended presidential campaign, spent so much money on ads that he could have instead delivered every American a fortune.

"Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads," the tweet said. "The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST."

Williams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that "somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he couldâ€™ve given every American a million dollars."

"Itâ€™s an incredible way of putting it," Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen.

If that sounds too good to be true, itâ€™s because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.

Thatâ€™s enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but itâ€™s not breaking the bank.

Williams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished.

"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math," Williams said after a commercial break. "Iâ€™m speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar."

"The tweet is wrong," he said.

Tonight on the air we quoted a tweet that relied on bad math. We corrected the error after the next commercial break and have removed it from later editions of tonightâ€™s program. We apologize for the error. â€” 11th Hour (@11thHour) March 6, 2020

Gay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was "buying a calculator, brb."

As for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, "I know, Iâ€™m bad at math."

Bloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people.

But even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didnâ€™t spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. Thatâ€™s bad math.
