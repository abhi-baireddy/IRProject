According to the internet, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi allegedly said that Social Security recipients are "leeches," and social media posts that share the quote are calling for users to "make it go viral."
The abrasive statement was fabricated by a website that says it posts satire and then re-shared on Facebook as if it were real news.
Although the satirical story was published in November 2019, Facebook text posts claiming she said it started to appear on the social network in April 2020.
The made-up statement was posted by Bustatroll.org, a website known for publishing fictional content in the name of satire, in a Nov. 14, 2019, story titled "Pelosi: ‘Social Security Recipients Are Just A Burden On Society.’"The article falsely claims that Pelosi called Social Security recipients "leeches" who "suck from the public teat" and are "nothing more than burdens on society."
However, these articles are frequently copied to other websites, or in this case, social media posts, that don't include any indication that the information was made-up.
