Kelly’s claim also ignores a more recent analysis that assigns the title of “maverick” to another justice.
When asked for evidence to back Kelly’s claim, his campaign referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to an Oct. 16, 2017 post by Ball titled "Justice Kelly a Maverick?
In that piece, Ball found that Kelly and Justice Rebecca Bradley were more receptive to Fourth Amendment arguments than their predecessors.
Reminder: The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects people against "unreasonable searches and seizures."
He didn’t outright call Kelly a maverick — he instead speculated that the justice could emerge as a possible, but only occasional maverick.
