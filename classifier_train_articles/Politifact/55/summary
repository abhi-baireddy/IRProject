Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: "So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?"
Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it.
But negotiations for the hostages’ release started well before Election Day.
Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release.
In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us.
