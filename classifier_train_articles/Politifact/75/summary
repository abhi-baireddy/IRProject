The post suggests pandemics occur with synchronicity every 100 years, in 1720, 1820, 1920 and 2020.
According to this post on Facebook, pandemics like COVID-19 strike with eerie precision, every 100 years:"1720 — Plague; 1820 — Cholera outbreak; 1920 — Spanish flu; 2020 — Chinese coronavirus.
The Facebook post suggests that pandemics only occur every 100 years.
Our rulingA claim on Facebook that a pandemic occurs exactly every 100 years cites four outbreaks that it says occurred in 1720, 1820, 1920 and 2020.
More importantly, the claim ignores many other pandemics over several centuries that did not occur in such a neat pattern.
