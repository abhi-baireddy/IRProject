Walmart announced senior shopping hours and pickup hours for at-risk customers, but it has not implemented a staggered daily shopping schedule based on age.
Social media posts falsely claim that Walmart is implementing a staggered shopping schedule that allows only certain age groups to shop in stores on designated days.
The alleged Walmart announcement, which contains multiple grammatical errors, reads:"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic effective immediately Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule as follows.
We apologize for the (sic) inconeince: Monday Age 66+, Tuesday 56-65, Wednesday 46-55, Thursday 36-45, Friday 25-35, Saturday 24 and below, Sunday Emergency shopping only."
The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
