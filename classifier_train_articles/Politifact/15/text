Walmart announced senior shopping hours and pickup hours for at-risk customers, but it has not implemented a staggered daily shopping schedule based on age.

Social media posts falsely claim that Walmart is implementing a staggered shopping schedule that allows only certain age groups to shop in stores on designated days.

A screenshot of the faux announcement shows someone saying they "guarantee this is true."

"I confirmed it with my boss. I’m thankful this is happening. Hopefully Kroger, Publix and Target will follow suit. I’ve been risking my life along with my family’s life to service these stores with excessive amounts of people and their all time attitudes. Yesterday was the worst."

The alleged Walmart announcement, which contains multiple grammatical errors, reads:

"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic effective immediately Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule as follows. We apologize for the (sic) inconeince: Monday Age 66+, Tuesday 56-65, Wednesday 46-55, Thursday 36-45, Friday 25-35, Saturday 24 and below, Sunday Emergency shopping only."

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
