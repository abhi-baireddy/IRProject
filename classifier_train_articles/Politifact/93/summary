Tony Evers’ pledge to reduce the state’s prison population by half as a sign Evers isn’t tough on crime.
Vos took aim at the governor in the email, saying Evers "wants to release half of the prison population."
He also said, during a Democratic debate, that cutting the prison population in half is "a goal that’s worth accomplishing."
The governor has, more than once, expressed the goal of reducing the state prison population by 50% as part of broader criminal justice reform.
But that’s a far cry from releasing half the prison population overnight, which is what Vos’ claim suggests.
