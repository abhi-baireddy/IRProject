Three screenshots using doctored images falsely suggest that there were reports of the same boyâ€™s death in three countries.
Stirring new grief for the family of a boy who committed suicide in 2017, people are sharing doctored images of the child in an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the coronavirus pandemic.
"Same little boy died of COVID-19 in three different countries," a Facebook post says facetiously.
Our rulingThis Facebook post does not show that the media is falsely suggesting that the same boy had died of the coronavirus in three different countries.
Rather, it shows that someone used doctored images of a child who reportedly killed himself to falsely suggest a media conspiracy over COVID-19.
