AUSTIN — A state judge said Wednesday afternoon that all voters in Texas afraid of contracting COVID-19 through in-person voting should be allowed to vote by mail during the pandemic.
Sulak’s decision came in the same hour that Paxton’s office said that fear of contracting COVID-19 does not qualify voters in upcoming state elections to vote by mail ballots.
The GOP has been hesitant to expand mail-in voting or make any other changes to election laws during the pandemic.
Texas Republicans have long opposed the expansion of mail-in voting, saying it is a system ripe for voter fraud.
Vassar warned that “third parties” who advise voters to apply for mail-in ballots because they fear catching the virus could be punished for election fraud.
