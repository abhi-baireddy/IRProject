Families with loved ones living at assisted-living facilities are weighing their options as the coronavirus spreads across North Texas, and residents of nursing homes are proving to be particularly vulnerable.
Jenkins suggested on Sunday that people should consider bringing loved ones home after several cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Dallas assisted-living facilities.
She added that for her and many other families, bringing a loved one home isn’t possible, practical or safe.
“Each family kind of has to decide what’s best for their loved ones,” Ross said.
Families that are able to bring a loved one home should take extra precautions, according to Ross.
