AUSTIN -- Hundreds of protesters marched on the Texas Capitol calling for an end to Gov.
Greg Abbott’s stay-at-home orders, likening them to “tyranny” and demanding the reopening of business in the state.
Protesters who carried signs that read “Vaccines can cause cancer and death," “Every job is essential” and “Open Now!"
The protest was organized by InfoWars, an Austin-based website that promotes conspiracy theories, and has a massive online following.
President Donald Trump, a Republican who has given multiple interviews to InfoWars, stoked on protesters on Friday by tweeting that protesters should “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.
