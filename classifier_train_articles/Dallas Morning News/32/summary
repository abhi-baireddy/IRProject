Greg Abbott’s decision to keep Texas schools closed for the rest of the semester, pointing to public health experts who have indicated social distancing is helping to flatten the curve.
Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa said Friday that Abbott’s decision wasn’t “a surprise, at all.”With coronavirus still affecting thousands of Texans daily, “it was inevitable,” Hinojosa said.
Prior to Abbott’s decision, 21 states, including all of Texas’ neighbors — Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico — had closed schools for the remainder of the academic year.
Cedar Hill Superintendent Gerald Hudson issued a statement saying it’s critical that schools stay closed to help stop the spread of the virus and to prepare for the next school year.
“Right now our expectations are that, come August, we’ll be able to launch a traditional school year,” Hinojosa said.
