Goleman, 59, of Arlington, canâ€™t go inside anymore to visit her mom.
Cindy Goleman visited her mother, Peggy White, from outside the window last week at The Pavilion at Creekwood, a healthcare and rehabilitation center in Mansfield.
Goleman speaks to her mother by phone as they visit through the window.
