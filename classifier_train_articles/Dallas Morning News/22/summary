Editor’s note: Art and the City is a special project by The Dallas Morning News arts and entertainment staff.
I played on that inspiration by reversing some of the sax sections to garner a subtle darkness to the song.
And for me that day the song really became about acceptance.
Dallas StrongMy song, “Dallas,” featuring Calvin Taylor and produced by MouseQuake and Taylor Pace, is all about Dallas pride and represents how phenomenal we can be when we work together as a community.
I really, really love how one artwork can have one hundred different meanings, even to the artist herself.
