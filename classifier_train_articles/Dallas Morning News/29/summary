The Wings selected the 6-4 Sabally, an All-American forward who grew up in Germany, with the No.
5 and South Carolina point guard Tyasha Harris at No.
Oregon point guard Sabrina Ionescu went No.
Experts had predicted the Wings would choose between Sabally or Baylorâ€™s Lauren Cox, a forward from Flower Mound, at No.
Harris, who averaged 12 points and 5.7 assists in 33 games for South Carolina as a senior, will offer depth at point guard.
