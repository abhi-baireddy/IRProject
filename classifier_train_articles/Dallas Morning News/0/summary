The private jet business isn’t immune to COVID-19′s chill on air travel.
JetSuite, a Dallas-based private aviation company, is shutting down operations “until further notice,” according to a posting on the company’s website.
In a March 25 interview, air travel website Skift reported that JetSuite’s business was quickly evaporating.
“We’ve shrunk down to a minimum viable schedule, one flight per day in each market.”The National Business Aviation Association, a trade group representing private jet companies, reported Friday that business aviation traffic took a precipitous drop from mid-March into April.
It was described at the time as a well-capitalized veteran of the competitive and fractured private aviation landscape.
