Last week in the Living Our Faith feature, we asked readers to respond to the question: Are you finding more time for quiet reflection while sheltering in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus?
Meditating to change habitsYes during this stay at home phase I do have more time for quiet reflection mainly because my commute time to work is saved.
During quiet reflection time, I am now able to look at long, lingering issues I have to work on.
Iâ€™ve decided to lean into the unknown and spend more quiet time reflecting on where I want to go from here.
