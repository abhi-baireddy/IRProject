On March 31, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission launched a hotline specifically for those struggling with depression or other mental health issues related to the pandemic.
The department’s mental health and substance use resources Web page has seen a nearly 500% increase in traffic since the start of April, Pestrikoff said.
“For the general public, the mental health effects of COVID-19 are as important to address as are the physical health effects,” said Bonnie Cook, executive director of the nonprofit Mental Health America of Greater Dallas.
The phone number for the state health commission’s “COVID-19 mental health support line,” which is staffed around the clock, is 833-986-1919.
