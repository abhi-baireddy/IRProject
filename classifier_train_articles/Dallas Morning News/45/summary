If this isn’t the most important draft in Cowboys’ history, it certainly will be treated as such.
I learned that by reading Mel Kiper Jr.’s Mock Draft 2.0 and 4.0.
That pick is also to be found in Todd McShay’s Mock Draft 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
He was also the Cowboys’ pick in Kiper’s 1.0.
With their needs being what they are, this looks like a draft where the Cowboys would want to move around in the first two rounds.
