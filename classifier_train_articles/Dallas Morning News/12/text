This historic mansion on Beverly in Highland Park makes its architectural significance known from the curb with its grand, white facade, manicured grounds and 1920s charm. The house was built in 1920 and designed by noted architect Hal Thomson.

At 12,940 square feet, the main house has enough room to host 100 people for a seated dinner. Significant social events hosted by the home’s previous owners that called for a room that size often made the social pages of The Dallas Morning News in the 1920s and ‘30s.

In the 1920s, the house was owned by H. E. Spalti, who co-founded one of Dallas’ first manufacturing companies in 1899, the Olive and Myers Furniture Manufacturing Company. Mr. Spalti was also a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

In the late ‘30s and early ‘40s, the house was passed on to Spalti’s daughter, Lenore Spalti, who became Mrs. J. Fred Engler. The historic home was the site of many socialite gatherings hosted by Mrs. Engler according to our archives.

The house sits on more than three-quarters of an acre in Highland Park on a corner lot that leaves plenty of space surrounding the large home. The two-story entryway of the main house is covered in marble, and the house has three living areas. On the ground floor level, the house has a large kitchen, breakfast room, dining room and those living areas. The main living area is decorated with an elaborate tile ceiling and flooring.

Listing agent Allie Beth Allman said the house was extensively remodeled in 2000.

“It was really gutted,” Allman said. “It became a new house.”

The home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. All of the bedrooms sit on the second floor. The master bedroom has a domed ceiling and a marble fireplace and a large, ensuite bathroom. Many of the remaining bedrooms and bathrooms are decorated with a variety of printed wallpaper in colorful schemes.

A fully-outfitted basement sits below and has a movie theater, a wine cellar with a dining area and an exercise facility. Outside, a pool is visible from the abundance of windows on the back side of the house.

The separate guest quarters feature a bedroom and bathroom on the lower level, a second bathroom, a large ballroom, a library and a wet bar. The grand ballroom’s elaborate flooring, cabinetry, chandeliers and fireplace convey a glamour that hearkens back to the home’s early days as a venue for many high-society celebrations.
