Texas’ unemployment rate jumped in March to its highest level in three years as the economic toll of pandemic restrictions enacted in the state’s major counties begin to be revealed.
The job losses pushed the unemployment rate from 3.5% in February to 4.7% in March.
March’s unemployment rate jump is just the tip of the iceberg, said Pia Orrenius, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
“It’s going to be far worse.”The Fed’s modeling projects Texas’ jobless rate could rise to at least 12% in April.
Most were in the restaurant and hotel industries, which bore the initial economic pain.
