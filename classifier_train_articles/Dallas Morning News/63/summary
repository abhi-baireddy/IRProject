Greg Abbott is temporarily closing schools, restaurant dining areas, gyms and bars statewide in his most sweeping action yet to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Offices and workplaces can remain open, but employees should be allowed to work from home if feasible, Abbott said.
“Literally, their life as an ongoing business is on the line if they violate the order,” Abbott said during the town hall.
ReactionDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who had pressed earlier in the week for a statewide order, thanked Abbott for his action.
Private institutions are included in the order temporarily closing all schools, said Laura Colangelo, executive director of the Texas Private Schools Association.
