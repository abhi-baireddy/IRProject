Based on sheer numbers alone, the Dallas areaâ€™s Muslim community went to considerable time and effort to collect and make two sizeable donations to Parkland Memorial Hospital on Friday.
First came a late-morning delivery of 1,500 meals and 1,000 boxes of sweets to hospital staff.
While making the initial mask deliveries, he saw the need for meals for doctors, nurses and hospital staff members who are working long hours.
Nafal reached out to Marouf and Ruba Kuzbari because of their connections in the Muslim community, and the grassroots effort quickly spread.
Now some of those restaurants are among the 20 that have volunteered to provide meals for hospital workers.
