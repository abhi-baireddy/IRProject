Amid social distancing and the threat of COVID-19, North Texas’ major commercial airports, DFW and Dallas Love Field, are trying to find a way to get passengers back into airports and feeling good about traveling again once the pandemic subsides.
DFW and Dallas Love Field combined are receiving more than $350 million in federal stimulus money through the Congressional aid package passed last month.
Dallas Love Field, which is owned by the city of Dallas, has about 250 days worth of cash.
Dallas Love Field hasn’t had any layoffs either, but has reduced contracts and let go of temporary workers.
Dallas Love Field is trying to cut about $20 million out of its $158 million annual budget, said Mark Duebner, Love Field’s director of aviation.
