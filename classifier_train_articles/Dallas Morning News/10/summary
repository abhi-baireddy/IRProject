And Dallas County sent a cease-and-desist letter to the owner of a smoke shop retail chain earlier this month for failing to close down during the pandemic in violation of a county order affecting nonessential businesses.
The Puff n Stuff Smoke Shop responded with a lawsuit Wednesday against the city and Dallas County, arguing it is an essential business under the bodega category.
The lawsuit, which seeks a restraining order against the city and county, was filed in Dallas County district court.
The letter, signed by Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, said it did not appear that Puff n Stuff Smoke Shop met the criteria outlined in his “safer at home” order.
This story was updated to include the city’s response to the Puff n Stuff lawsuit as well as the federal judge’s granting of the government’s request for a restraining order.
