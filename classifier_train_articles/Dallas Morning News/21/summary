Nine monks at Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas have tested positive for COVID-19 and two remain hospitalized, though both are expected to recover, the abbot of the monastery said Friday.
One of the hospitalized monks is in his 70s, the other in his 80s.
The Cistercian Abbey was founded in Dallas in the mid-1950s by monks who had been driven out of Hungary by the Communists.
Now, each of the sick monks in the abbey has a healthy brother assigned to him — “one negative monk to one positive monk,” Verhalen said.
The healthy monks wear masks and gloves to deliver food to a table outside the sick monks’ doors.
