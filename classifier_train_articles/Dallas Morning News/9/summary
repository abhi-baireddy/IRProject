WASHINGTON -- When Jordan Cortes’ flight from Peru touched down in Miami Saturday night, the entire plane full of U.S. citizens clapped with relief to be back on American soil after being stranded abroad for weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Texan was among several stranded abroad after the coronavirus pandemic prompted canceled flights and the closure of borders worldwide.
Cortes was offered a seat on an April 11 repatriation flight, only after The Dallas Morning News inquired about the family’s status the day before.
Over 7,000 of them came from Peru on 46 different repatriation flights, the highest number of any country.
Since he returned to the U.S., neither Cortes nor his wife have been contacted by the U.S. Embassy in Lima about a repatriation flight for Neciosup and their baby.
