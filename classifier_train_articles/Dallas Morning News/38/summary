When spring training screeched to a halt, Kyle Gibson was still in the process of meeting some of his new Rangers teammates.
Nevertheless…“That’s kind of a tricky test,” Gibson said Thursday after an announcement that the charitable foundation he works with, Big League Impact, had raised more than $900,000 to help feed school children impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, Food for the Soul, which partners with area churches to feed school children in need, will receive a donation expected to be worth more than $50,000.
A total of 50 players representing all 30 MLB teams contributed to the drive headed by Gibson and St. Louis’ Adam Wainwright.
Big League Impact had raised a similar amount of money last fall in what was to be a first annual drive.
