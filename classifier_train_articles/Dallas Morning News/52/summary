Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Monday in a letter to Gov.
"I checked and according to my office, we've had zero inquiries or phone calls from the Dallas County Judge - ever - with regards to COVID-19," he said.
"That was the reason behind why I sent that letter to Judge Jenkins," Abbott said.
Saenz said the governorâ€™s office learned from a military official that Jenkins had suggested the county would not use the hospital.
The county judge plans to brief the Commissioners Court on Tuesday on the costs associated with the hospital, including security, food and medical supplies.
