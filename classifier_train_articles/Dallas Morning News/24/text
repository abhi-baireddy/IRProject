Days after hosting a virtual benefit concert for family farmers, Willie Nelson has announced a virtual variety show to benefit pot prisoners.

“Come and Toke It” will air online and on Twitch at 4:20 p.m. on 4/20, the unofficial marijuana holiday. The 4-hour and 20-minute show is free, but viewers are urged to donate to the Last Prisoner Project, a pot industry group “dedicated to making sure every last victimless cannabis prisoner walks free.”

Nelson has been busted multiple times for weed possession, including in Dallas in 1974. He’s also a noted pot-preneur, having founded Willie’s Reserve, a farm-to-bong cannabis company whose products can be bought wherever ganja is sold legally. In terms of his own intake, Nelson said last year he’d stopped consuming marijuana by smoking it.

He’ll be joined on “Come and Toke It” by a group of as-yet-unnamed comedians, chefs, artists and cannabis experts. No word on what songs Nelson will perform, but don’t be surprised to hear him sing his 2012 classic “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.”
