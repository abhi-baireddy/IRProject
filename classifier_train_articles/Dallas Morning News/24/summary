Days after hosting a virtual benefit concert for family farmers, Willie Nelson has announced a virtual variety show to benefit pot prisoners.
“Come and Toke It” will air online and on Twitch at 4:20 p.m. on 4/20, the unofficial marijuana holiday.
In terms of his own intake, Nelson said last year he’d stopped consuming marijuana by smoking it.
He’ll be joined on “Come and Toke It” by a group of as-yet-unnamed comedians, chefs, artists and cannabis experts.
No word on what songs Nelson will perform, but don’t be surprised to hear him sing his 2012 classic “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.”
