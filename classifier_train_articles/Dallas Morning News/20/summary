Children are doing their schoolwork at home.
Well, some are, and you can see for yourself when Galleria Dallas’ Showtime Saturdays series moves to Facebook temporarily.
Each week, a new prerecorded video featuring the antics of a Showtime Saturdays regular will be posted to Galleria Dallas’ Facebook page at the series’ regular time.
New shows are available Saturdays at 11:30 a.m. at facebook.com/galleriadallas.
Previous shows are available to watch anytime.
