Children are doing their schoolwork at home. And some parents are also working remotely. But what about their favorite local entertainers? Are clowns clownin’ around at home? Are magicians doing card tricks? Jugglers throwing stuff into the air? Well, some are, and you can see for yourself when Galleria Dallas’ Showtime Saturdays series moves to Facebook temporarily.

Each week, a new prerecorded video featuring the antics of a Showtime Saturdays regular will be posted to Galleria Dallas’ Facebook page at the series’ regular time. So far, fans have seen clowns Slappy and Monday perform slapstick comedy in their living room, a show of tricks and character sketches featuring Magic Mike and a variety show by Kelli and Julio Ramazini featuring juggling and aerial silks.

Each show is about 15 minutes long and free to watch. Upcoming performances include Knock Knock’s Magic Mayhem Show on April 18, singer-songwriter and author Mister Willy on April 25 and the return of Slappy and Monday on May 2.

New shows are available Saturdays at 11:30 a.m. at facebook.com/galleriadallas. Previous shows are available to watch anytime.
