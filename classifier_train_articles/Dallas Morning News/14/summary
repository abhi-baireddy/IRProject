Abbott branded the limited operations “retail to go.”It’s basically delivery and curbside pickup, services that grocery retailers and department stores and other retailers have offered as part of their e-commerce operations in recent years.
Some retailers complained that Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, Costco, H-E-B and other essential retailers could be open and sell nonessential merchandise while they were forced to cease all operations.
J.C. Penney has been working on adding curbside to some stores and will offer it next week in Texas, a spokeswoman said.
Joann offered curbside pickup after the craft stores were closed by Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins.
Best Buy, which has been allowed to be open under the essential rules, has operated curbside at its stores.
