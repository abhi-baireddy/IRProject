A new survey of major-college athletic directors indicates that some have interest in short-term changes to the pay of highly compensated employees and to the NCAA’s academic rules as their programs deal with impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.
►More than 55% of respondents said their programs do not have a financial reserve to help them through this situation.
The 15-question survey was conducted electronically from March 23 through March 27, and 111 AD’s responded, according to LEAD1.
LEAD1 President and CEO Tom McMillen highlighted athletic directors' concern about athletes’ academic progress.
Some of them are saying, ‘Sixteen sports — can’t we have a break on that for a while?’ Everything is dependent on football."
