Shannon DonnellyPalm Beach Daily NewsPALM BEACH, Fla. – As the coronavirus pandemic strangles the state’s hospitality industry, even the Guy in Charge is feeling the squeeze.
Two of the Trump Organization’s properties in South Florida — the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach and Trump Doral in Miami — have furloughed all “non-essential” staff, a total of 713 people.
At President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club, 153 people will be furloughed, according to a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) letter sent to Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity by Janine Gill, director of human resources at the Mar-a-Lago Club, and copied to Palm Beach Mayor Gail Coniglio.
Mar-a-Lago Club first notified members of a partial closure on March 19, in response to health concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak, that would affect its restaurant and spa and cancel aerobics classes.
Its Beach Club remained open through the summer, offering its members and guests casual food, beverages, and both ocean and pool swimming.
