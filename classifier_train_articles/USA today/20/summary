The SE is $399, while the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999.
(And if you want to throw in extras, like more storage, Apple Care and a case, the bill comes to $1,917.)
There simply isn't any need to reach for the $1,000 to bring a shiny phone home.
Let's begin by critically comparing the SE to the 11 Pro.
It has the same 4.7 inch screen, but a more powerful A13 processing chip, like on the top of the line 11 Pro.
