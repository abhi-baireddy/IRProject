Clemson University is becoming involved, too, even off campus and when in-person classes are canceled.
This week, Police Chief Jeff Stone said any more large gatherings will be broken up, even those on private property.
"We obviously had concerns because of the number of people there," Stone told The Greenville News and Anderson Independent Mail.
The city of Clemson also reached out to the university to help curb future gatherings, Stone said.
He asked Clemson University Police Chief Greg Mullen to help communicate the need for social distancing to students.
