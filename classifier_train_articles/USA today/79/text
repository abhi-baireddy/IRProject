Los Angeles Rams center Brian Allen has tested positive for COVID-19, a team spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. Allen is the first known active NFL player to test positive for COVID-19.

Allen first tested positive for the novel coronavirus three weeks ago, reported Fox's Jay Glazer. Allen is now symptom-free, according to Glazer, who also reported that the third-year Rams player also lost his senses of smell and taste while battling the coronavirus.

Allen, who started 22 games in his first two seasons with the Rams, was a fourth-round draft pick out of Michigan State in 2018.

An unknown member of the Los Angeles Chargers has tested positive for COVID-19 and two other members of the organization also have shown symptoms, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. In late March, a SoFi Stadium construction worker tested positive for COVID-19. SoFi Stadium in Inglewood is set to open this fall and will be home to both the Rams and Chargers.
