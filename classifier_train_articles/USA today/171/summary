Williams said it's unlikely children would be less likely to be infected by the new coronavirus.
"So, at this time I don't think we know the likelihood of children becoming infected with COVID-19 and developing milder illnesses."
"Family spread of any respiratory virus is common due to the close and repeated contact within families," he said.
The demographic with the highest risk for complications and death include people over 60 years old and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer.
