:Money set to roll out to AmericansIf you did not file your federal income tax return or your state income tax return, there is no reason to panic about the traditional April 15 income tax deadline.
Many states, including Alabama, California and Michigan, are extending the deadline to July 15, the same date as federal income taxes are now due.
If you want information, go to IRS.gov or IRS.gov/Refunds to check on the status of your federal income tax refund.
The delay applies to estimated income tax payments for both federal and state income taxes, in Michigan, for example.
Still OK to file in April, May or JuneIf you're owed an income tax refund for 2019, it's perfectly fine to file your state and federal income taxes long before the July 15 deadline.
