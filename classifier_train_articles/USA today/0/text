With the release of Animal Crossing New Horizons and most of us looking for something to entertain us, it seems like everyone and their mother are trying to buy a Nintendo Switch. Because of this, the Nintendo is sold out pretty much everywhere, so if you've been itching to get one, you'll have very slim pickings. Plus, you'll have to sift around third-party sellers and price hikes to get the OG console.

Thankfully, you can still find the Nintendo Switch Lite (the Switch's cheaper cousin) at a few reliable retailers, though you may have to wait several days to have it shipped to your door. The biggest difference between the two consoles is that the Switch Lite is solely a handheld console (similar to a Nintendo DS), so you lose out on the ability to hook up to your TV and play party games. But if you're more interested in solo play and want to spend less, we think the Switch Lite is a great option—especially in these trying times.

To help you get your game on, we've rounded up all the retailers where you can find the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite, and will continue to update this as the consoles go in and out of stock.
