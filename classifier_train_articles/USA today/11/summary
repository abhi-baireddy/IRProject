John ReidFlorida Times-UnionThe Jacksonville Jaguars reportedly have had trade discussions with several teams regarding running back Leonard Fournette.
The Jaguars have until May 3 to exercise the fifth-year option on Fournette’s contract.
If they don’t, Fournette can become an unrestricted free agent in 2021.
On Thursday, Fournette made a guest appearance on ESPN’s First Take show to pitch for quarterback Cam Newton to join him in Jacksonville.
The Jaguars declined the option on Ryan’s contract in February, which allowed him to become a free agent.
