The Jacksonville Jaguars reportedly have had trade discussions with several teams regarding running back Leonard Fournette.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Jaguars are actively listening to offers.

The Jaguars have until May 3 to exercise the fifth-year option on Fournette’s contract. If they don’t, Fournette can become an unrestricted free agent in 2021.

On Thursday, Fournette made a guest appearance on ESPN’s First Take show to pitch for quarterback Cam Newton to join him in Jacksonville.

Fournette also posted a cryptic tweet this past Wednesday when he wrote — how one person destroyed our 2017 AFC championship team but never mentioning the name.

It’s speculated that Fournette was referring to former football executive Tom Coughlin, who was fired in December after the NFL Players Association sent a letter to the league’s players that revealed over 25 percent of the grievances filed by players had been against the Jaguars.

Meanwhile, linebacker Jake Ryan rarely got on the field for the Jaguars last season due to injuries, playing in only two games.

But that didn’t sway the Baltimore Ravens from agreeing to a one-year contract with Ryan on Saturday, pending him passing a physical examination.

The Jaguars declined the option on Ryan’s contract in February, which allowed him to become a free agent.
