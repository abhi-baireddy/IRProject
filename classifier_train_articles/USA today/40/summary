As the coronavirus continues to slam the United States, counties in Hawaii have slowly begun to shut down vacation rentals.
While Ige has declared hotels and motels as essential businesses that can remain open, vacation rentals or bead and breakfasts are not included.
So counties are taking restrictions a step further: In Hawaii and Kauai counties, the mayors are shutting down vacation rentals.
On April 10, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim declared that bed and breakfasts, short term rentals and time shares must ceases operation.
Vacation rentals include "hosted and non‐hosted rentals typically single‐family houses or condominium apartment units and primarily used by for visitors from off‐island," according to a fact sheet released by the Kim's office.
