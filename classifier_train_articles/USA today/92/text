BOSTON — It's the largest college admissions scandal in the history of the United States, a multi-million, high-stakes drama, playing out in a Boston federal courthouse.

The Justice Department revealed its sweeping case, dubbed "Varsity Blues," with guilty pleas in March from a handful of defendants, including the scheme's mastermind, Rick Singer. He admitted to funneling portions of $25 million in bribes he took from rich parents to coaches, test-cheaters and others to get their children into some of the nation's top universities.

More pleas followed. Those admitting guilt included wealthy parents such as actress Felicity Huffman, CEOs, a wine vineyard owner, a self-help author, a prominent attorney and college coaches. Huffman, the first to be sentenced in the case, received two weeks in prison, which she served in October.

In all, 31 out of 53 total defendants, including 21 parents, have waived their rights to a trial and pleaded guilty to crimes in deals with prosecutors. Thirteen of these parents, including Huffman, have been sentenced. Only one avoided prison. More sentences will be imposed in 2020.

Another 22 defendants, including actress Lori Loughlin and 14 other parents, have pleaded not guilty and are digging in for a legal battle.

Some of the parents ordered to prison are like Huffman, who paid Singer to have someone cheat on their children's ACT or SAT test. Others paid larger amounts to have their children classified as athletic recruits.

Also pleading guilty are people such as Mark Riddell, the man who took the tests for the applicants, and coaches who agreed to classify students as athletes to open a "back door" into their schools.

Here's an up-to-date tracker of the defendants in the scandal.
