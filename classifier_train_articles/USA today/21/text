It’s hard to know what to do right now.

We’re stuck inside. We're social distancing. We’re keeping up with friends, with family, with the community and with the news as best we can. It is a lot to manage for anyone, and the timeframe is uncertain. But, we're going to get through it. And USA TODAY wants to help.

Welcome to Staying Apart, Together, a twice-weekly newsletter from USA TODAY.

Staying Apart, Together is a newsletter about coping with the pandemic and its effect on your life. Our USA TODAY team will share with you whatever tips, tricks, insights and moments of joy we can. That might mean some funny TikTok videos to get you through the day, advice on making the most of distance learning for your kids, tips on navigating your finances in a crisis, or mental health resources. Every Saturday and Tuesday we'll be in your inbox, offering you a virtual hug and a little bit of solace in these difficult times.

Sign up here to get Staying Apart, Together twice a week in your inboxes.

I’m Kelly Lawler, USA TODAY’s TV Critic, and I’m writing to you from a makeshift desk in my apartment in Vienna, Virginia, while my dog wanders by and my husband works in the bedroom. I hope that I can offer you some comfort with these twice-weekly updates. I know we can all get through this. Together.
