A Gilead Sciences antiviral drug is reportedly showing promise for treatment of the coronavirus.
"We understand the urgent need for a COVID-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir," Ridley said in an email.
"Nonetheless an effective treatment that reduces the need for ICU beds, speeds up discharges, & reduces mortality could hypothetically provide relief to the (health care) system."
Remdesivir, the result of more than a decade of Gilead research, has been tested for multiple potential applications in recent years.
"We are doing this before knowing whether remdesivir will be determined to be safe and effective to treat patients with COVID-19."
