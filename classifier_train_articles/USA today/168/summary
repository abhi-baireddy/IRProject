The Houston Texans found a wide receiver to help fill the void left by the team's split with DeAndre Hopkins.
The Los Angeles Rams are trading Brandin Cooks and a future fourth-round pick to the Texans in exchange for a second-round pick this year, two people with knowledge of the move told USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones.
Cooks, 26, is the latest standout player to be sent packing by Los Angeles after star running back Todd Gurley was released last month.
The Texans traded Hopkins, the three-time all-pro pass catcher, to the Arizona Cardinals in March.
Houston also signed slot receiver Randall Cobb to join Will Fuller and Kenny Stills, both of whom have contracts set to expire after this season.
