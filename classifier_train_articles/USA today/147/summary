A coalition of advocacy groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the University of California, demanding that its nine undergraduate campuses stop requiring applicants to submit results from the SAT or ACT.
Those in favor of abolishing the test requirement have some allies at the highest levels of the college system.
The ACT used to be the more widely used test, but the SAT, administered by the College Board, overtook it in recent years.
“The testing industry always viewed California as the grand prize, because it could serve as a grand marketing tool,” he says.
University of California officials say no action will be taken until a formal review of the tests’ relevance is concluded.
