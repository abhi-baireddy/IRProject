WASHINGTON â€“ President Donald Trump called on supporters Friday to "liberate" states that have experienced protests over coronavirus lockdowns, a day after he unveiled guidelines aimed at reopening the nation's economy.
Trump has lurched from slamming Democratic governors, to saying he has developed friendships with them and back to attacking them.
In a series of combative tweets Friday, Trump defended his performance on the virus, renewed his criticism of New York Gov.
All three states that Trump called to "liberate" are led by Democratic governors, and all three have experienced protests in recent days demanding a rollback of stay-at-home orders.
Trump declined to say which states he thought should move toward reopening under new guidelines he announced Thursday.
