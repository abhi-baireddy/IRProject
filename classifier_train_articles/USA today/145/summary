Amid a global helium shortage, Party City announced Thursday it will shutter 45 stores in 2019.
The New Jersey-based party supplies company did not release a list of affected stores but said the closures will take place throughout the year.
There are 870 Party City stores in the U.S. and Canada and the closures represent about 5% of locations.
Party City CEO James Harrison said in a statement Thursday the company typically closes 10 to 15 stores each year.
Party City said it is working to secure a new helium source and a contract, which is subject to final approval, would provide its stores with helium beginning this summer and continuing for several years.
