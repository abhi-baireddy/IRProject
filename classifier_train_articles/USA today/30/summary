Americans have received conflicting information on when they will receive stimulus checks due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
The government is prioritizing the first few waves of payments in the coming weeks toward low-income Americans and Social Security beneficiaries, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax.
About 80% of Americans are eligible to receive a stimulus payment, according to the IRS.
It will be calculated based on information from their SSA-1099 Social Security Benefit Statement for 2019 or RRB-1099 Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement and deposited by the IRS.
There are as many as 10 million Americans who arenâ€™t required to file a tax return, according to TurboTax.
