Dr. Phil McGraw's comments comparing swimming pool and car accident deaths to the coronavirus pandemic have him in hot water.
He claimed 360,000 people die every year from swimming pool accidents and we 'don’t shut the country down for that.'
Others pointed out the fact that Dr. Phil is not a licensed physician.
"Dr Phil isn’t an MD, he has a PHD in clinical psychology," wrote Molly Jong-Fast.
"It would be a gift to the world and would probably save a lot of lives if Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz never made another television appearance for the rest of eternity," tweeted Adrienne Elrod.
