Americans have started receiving stimulus check payments from the government, and new data shows how they’re spending it.

Checks for millions of Americans, a central part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, began cropping up in bank accounts last week. Many people immediately used the funds to cover life necessities and pay back friends, according to data compiled by the digital banking service Current.

People who received stimulus checks starting Friday already spent 16% on food orders, 14% on money transfers to friends and relatives, and 10% on gas. Grocery stores are eating up 9% of stimulus checks while 4% of the money is covering bills, Current found.

Most of the country is spending more time at home, and people are using portions of the economic impact payment to keep them entertained. Five percent of the money people received went toward video games, Current found.

With more than 16 million people suddenly out of a job, the report offers an early look at how Americans are spending the one-time payout meant to buoy the economy left battered by widespread shelter-in-place orders.

Under the new federal CARES Act, most U.S. adults will receive some type of payment. By the end of the day on April 15, more than 80 million Americans who have set up direct deposit with the IRS will receive payments of up to $1,200, according to the Treasury Department.

If the IRS has your bank account information on file, the cash influx will appear automatically. If the IRS doesn’t already have your account information, or if you didn’t file taxes in 2018 or 2019, you can submit your information on the government website.

The fintech startup Current already credited 16,595 accounts with stimulus payments. Within five days, 45% of the money was spent.
