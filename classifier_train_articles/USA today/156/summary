The University of Arizona athletic department projects a $7.5 million revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year ending in June due to the current coronavirus outbreak and has frozen all athletic spending, hiring and raises, according to an internal memo obtained by USA TODAY Sports.
A handful of athletics departments have already announced pay cuts or cancellation of bonuses, and Cincinnati became the first school with a prominent football program to cut a sport on Tuesday, announcing that it would no longer field a men’s soccer team.
Heeke’s letter to Arizona staffers noted that the school had extended deadlines for season ticket holders to renew for football and basketball in hopes that that revenue, which would not count toward this fiscal year, could help offset future losses.

“While we all want answers, there is still so much that is uncertain with this worldwide crisis and its short and long-term impacts.”Arizona’s most recent financial disclosures indicate that it generated $105.1 million in total operating revenue in 2019.
