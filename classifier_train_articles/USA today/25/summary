More than 91% of those surveyed said they feared children in their districts would go hungry during the school shutdowns.
In Detroit, school officials shut down the district’s distribution program for two days last week after employees there became sick.
Even in districts where food distributions continued last week, school officials and community groups struggled to find innovative ways to reach the most students.
In the meantime, other school districts have offered to serve his district’s students and parents.
