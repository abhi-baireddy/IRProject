Starbucks is serving up free coffee for first responders and healthcare workers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.
The coffee giant announced Wednesday that through May 3 "any customer who identifies as a first responder or frontline worker supporting our healthcare system" will receive a free tall brewed coffee, either hot or iced.
The offer is for police officers, firefighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, hospital and medical staff and medical researchers, Starbucks said.
In a blog post, Starbucks said around the world its employees have been delivering coffee to hospitals, grocery stores, nursing homes and first responders.
Last week, Starbucks switched to a drive-thru and delivery-only model as it continues to adjust to the evolving coronavirus outbreak.
