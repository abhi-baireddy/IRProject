And with so many teams busy altering their looks, it seemed as good a time as any to update my NFL uniform power rankings from 2019.
If they stick with white helmets, how about going back to including numbers inside a blue lightning arc?
Philadelphia Eagles (7): Topped with those signature wings, few helmets look cooler.
Kansas City Chiefs (9): The red and white uniforms are simplistic though clean.
Atlanta Falcons (25): Thumbs up â€“ matte black helmet and embrace of "ATL" on the new, largely toned-down uniforms.
