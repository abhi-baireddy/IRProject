Gas prices continue to drastically drop with more than a dozen states selling gas for under $1 a gallon.
With consumers driving less as the coronavirus pandemic keeps them home, the national average gas price Friday was $1.82, down 6 cents from a week ago, according to AAA.
DeHaan said chances are good the national average could “eventually drop under the 2008/2009 low as well.” In late December 2008, the national average was $1.59, according to GasBuddy.
Yet, with some parts of the country planning to reopen soon, are consumers expected to be able to take advantage of the low prices?
DeHaan believes there is strong potential that gas prices will be lower this summer than previously projected.
