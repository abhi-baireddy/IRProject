The new feature, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center, was built in collaboration with top health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.
Facebook users in the U.S. and parts of Europe will begin seeing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center over the next 24 hours, with other countries coming on line in coming days.
Facebook is consulting with health organizations and governments in each country to determine what information will be featured, he said.
In addition to seeing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center at the top of your news feeds, you can follow the information center to get updates from health authorities directly in your news feed.
In the U.S., Facebook users will find features to help them connect with local groups and ask for help from or offer help in their communities.
