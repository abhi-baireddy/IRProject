Chase Young, DE, Ohio State: College football's most dominant force is about to become the NFL's problem — except for the team that drafts him.
Jeff Okudah, CB, Ohio State: Hard to imagine a more complete cornerback coming out of college.
Jerry Jeudy, WR, Alabama: If it were possible for an undergrad receiver to obtain a master's degree in the art of catching passes, Jeudy would already have one.
Henry Ruggs III, WR, Alabama: The 25 touchdowns on 100 career touches teased Ruggs' untapped potential, and the 4.27-second 40-yard dash at the combine — somehow disappointing by his own standard — reinforced it.
Justin Jefferson, WR, LSU: Between his know-how as a route-runner and competitiveness in hauling in contested catches, Jefferson offers traits that will make him a trusted target for almost any quarterback.
