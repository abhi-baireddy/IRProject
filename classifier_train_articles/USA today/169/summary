Oregon police recovered thousands of N95 respirators after a man allegedly stole at least 20 cases of the masks, worth nearly $2,500.
The next day, staff at the center found the N95 respirators listed on Craigslist and being sold in nearby Beaverton, Oregon.
Vladislav V. Drozdek, 22, of Beaverton, was arrested and charged with first degree theft, and six cases of the masks were recovered.
