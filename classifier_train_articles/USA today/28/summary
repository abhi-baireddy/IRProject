Starting Friday, New Yorkers who can't maintain a social distance from others must wear a face mask, while Maryland residents must don a face covering before going into any retail store beginning Saturday.
Los Angeles mandated last week that shoppers and workers wear face coverings during “essential shopping.” Under the order, businesses may refuse entry to anyone not wearing a face covering.
• Miami: Face coverings are required for people going into restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies and other retail stores.
• Chickasha, Oklahoma: People within the city limits are required to wear a cloth face mask when making a public outing for essential activities, according to KFOR.
• Riverside County, California: Residents must wear face coverings in public or face a $1.000 fine.
