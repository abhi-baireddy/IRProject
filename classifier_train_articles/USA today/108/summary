Police are warning parents to monitor their children's activity amid the coronavirus pandemic after two teens appeared to film themselves coughing on produce at a Virginia grocery store.
Police notified the public of the incident last week and identified the juveniles involved using CCTV footage, notified their parents, and interviewed them.
Officers reviewed the footage and found no actual customers or produce were spit or coughed on directly.
Police determined there was no criminal intent and the identities and the video footage of the teens was not released because of their age.
That video was viewed more than 13 million times, several copycat videos were posted and multiple people were arrested.
