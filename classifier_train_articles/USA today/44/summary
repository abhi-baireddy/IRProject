If you're behind on child support, you either won't get a stimulus check or will receive a reduced one.
If you qualified, you could receive a share of a refund or stimulus check rather than having the entire amount go toward late child support payments.
The IRS typically works with the Office of Child Support Enforcement so the agency is aware of who has fallen behind on child support payments.
If you're claiming unemployment and a child support order is in place, you can have child support payments withheld.
Some states will limit back child support collection to 50% of each check so that the person who owes child support would still collect unemployment, while other states may garnish differently for back child support.
