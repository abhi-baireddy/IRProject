The Major League Baseball draft is coming, but no one knows the date or whether there will even be a central site.
These are the new rules during the unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic, preparing for a baseball draft like no other.
But with draft limits in place and signing bonus restrictions embedded, there is a growing fear MLB is endangering their future.
“We are hopeful that those kids will still sign, even if they’re not drafted," said Tony Clark, executive director of the MLB Players Association.
MLB players with guaranteed contracts are being paid an advance totaling about $286,500 through May, but they receive no salary.
