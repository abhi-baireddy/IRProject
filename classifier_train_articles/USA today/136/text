Update: For the third week in a row, Taco Bell is offering free tacos Tuesday, April 14.

Taco Bell usually saves its free taco giveaways for major sporting events like the World Series or the NBA Finals.

Taco Bell is bringing back its free Doritos Locos Tacos giveaway Tuesday, April 7. No purchase is necessary to get the free seasoned beef tacos.

The fast-food chain introduced the giveaway last Tuesday as part of its coronavirus response.

In a letter posted on Tacobell.com, CEO Mark King said the giveaway is to show the company's appreciation and that "we're all in this together."

"It’s a small way for us to say thank you for the ways you’re showing up for your communities and our chance to give you a little TLC during this time," King said.

Taco Bell's parent company is taking actions in response to the pandemic, the Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported Monday.

Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs will forgo his 2020 base salary to help the company's workers and has "voluntarily elected to forgo all salary compensation for the balance of 2020," effective Monday, according to a company Securities Exchange and Commission filing.

The company said Gibbs' money will go to fund one-time $1,000 bonuses for the 1,200 restaurant general managers at company-owned KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Grill locations.

Some restaurants have made freebies available for health care workers or first responders. Starbucks is giving away free coffee through May 3 to both groups.
