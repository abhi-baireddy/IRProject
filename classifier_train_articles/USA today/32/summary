Yet I can certainly see studio football – staging games in NFL stadiums without fans – as perhaps the only way to save the season.
The league's contingencies include playing a truncated season – maybe 12 games, maybe 14 rather than the 16-game regular-season slate.
For decades, the NFL has been considered “a TV sport” with probably more than 90% of NFL fans having never actually attended a game.
Yet it’s a given that to reopen at all – and that would include reopening team headquarters, minicamps, training camp – widespread and rapid coronavirus testing needs to be in place.
