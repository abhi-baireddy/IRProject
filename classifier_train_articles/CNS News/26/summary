(Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has joined in an effort to curtail the religious liberty of Catholics.
As you can see, Pelosi is on the opposite side of this case from the Little Sisters of the Poor.
In fact, the language of the Affordable Care Act did not expressly mandate that insurance plans include "contraceptive" coverage.
The Supreme Court will hear the case this month.
The brief that Nancy Pelosi signed along with 148 other House members and 37 senators argued that protecting religious liberty has to be balanced against "compelling government interests."
