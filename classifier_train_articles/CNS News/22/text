(CNSNews.com) - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif.) sent out a tweet on Thursday to remind Americans that “[e]very life is precious” and to upbraid those who would take a path to re-opening the economy that is not a “science & testing-based path.”

“To say ‘People will die, so be it’ instead of a science & testing-based path to reopening the economy is deeply frivolous & wrong,” Pelosi said in her tweet.

“Every life is precious,” she said.

“Each death is heartbreaking—for a family & for a community,” Pelosi said. “This is something we are all in together. #FamiliesFirst”
