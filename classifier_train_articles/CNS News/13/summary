All people have human rights because of human dignity, including those who identify as LGBT, but this report bypasses the treaty negotiation process to simply assert that beliefs about sexual orientation and gender should trump the internationally-recognized human right of religious freedom.
When a new right is asserted, it should be scrutinized to determine if it violates fundamental human rights.
It opens the door to criticism that human rights are just a pretext for imposing Western values.
By hosting two groundbreaking ministerial summits on protecting international religious freedom, the U.S. has also created important multilateral alliances.
But for this to happen, the U.S. and like-minded allies must hold UN bureaucrats accountable for protecting human rights according to the texts of treaties, rather than undermining their very purpose.
