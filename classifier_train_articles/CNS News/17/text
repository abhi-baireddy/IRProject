Christian leader Franklin Graham said that President Trump's plan to reopen America is "good news," but added that leftists and the liberal media seem to want to "further weaken the economy -- not to save lives -- but to try to use this to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election."

"They would like to go into this election, not with the strongest economy in 70 years, but with the weakest," he said. "What the impeachment didn’t do, they are hoping the coronavirus will."

In an Apr. 17 post on Facebook, Rev. Graham said, "It was encouraging to hear President Donald J. Trump announce guidelines yesterday for opening up America again. That is good news -- we thank God that it looks like we are past the peak of the coronavirus infection rate."

"We don’t want to delay opening up America," said the reverend. "We’ve got to get our country up and running before the economy and people’s lives are damaged even more."

"... I definitely agree that we all need to take precautions, wear masks, wash our hands, etc.," he said, "however, we also have to learn how to conduct business and keep production going during a pandemic."

"This is just my opinion," said Graham, "but in listening to the Democratic politicians and the liberal media, it seems that they would like to see this shut-down drag out into the summer months and further weaken the economy -- not to save lives -- but to try to use this to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election."

"They would like to go into this election, not with the strongest economy in 70 years, but with the weakest," he said. "What the impeachment didn’t do, they are hoping the coronavirus will."

"Pray for our country and for the President, that God will give Him wisdom," concluded Graham.
