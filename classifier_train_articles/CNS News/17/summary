Franklin Graham (Getty Images)(Getty Images)Christian leader Franklin Graham said that President Trump's plan to reopen America is "good news," but added that leftists and the liberal media seem to want to "further weaken the economy -- not to save lives -- but to try to use this to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election."
"They would like to go into this election, not with the strongest economy in 70 years, but with the weakest," he said.
Graham said, "It was encouraging to hear President Donald J. Trump announce guidelines yesterday for opening up America again.
"We’ve got to get our country up and running before the economy and people’s lives are damaged even more."
"Pray for our country and for the President, that God will give Him wisdom," concluded Graham.
