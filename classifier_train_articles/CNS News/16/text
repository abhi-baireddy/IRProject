(CNSNews.com) - Every crisis, including the current pandemic, presents an opportunity to "build back better than before," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told a Friday news conference.

"You take that moment, and you learn that lesson and you improve society. We have to do that here," he said:

What have we been talking about doing that we should be doing -- that this is now an opportunity to do? We've been talking about re-imagining the workforce and workplace. Does everybody actually have to drive into the office every day, or did we learn that there are ways to telecommute and work from home where it's actually more efficient, it's actually more effective? What do we do about a transit system and how do we make it safer, not just the way we've been talking about but also from a public health point of view. And how are we now smarter about the public interactions? I can't tell you how many doctors now have come to me and said, you know, I said for years we shouldn't be shaking hands, and it's a total way to transmit germs and viruses, et cetera. So how do we take this moment since we are paused anyway and actually come back smarter?

‘I was missing a lot’

Cuomo, a divorced father of three, then indulged in a "moment of personal reflection."
