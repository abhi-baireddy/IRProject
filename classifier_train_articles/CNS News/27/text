On the “Issues” page of her official congressional website, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D.-Minn.) says that there are “over 11 million undocumented immigrations [sic] living in the United States.”

The top issue listed on the page is: “Immigration.’

That heading is followed by a paragraph that says:

“In Congress, I am committed to doing all I can to help the over 11 million undocumented immigrations living in the United States come out of the shadows and get access to rights and privileges they deserve. Just as importantly, we cannot continue to ignore the plight of migrants and refugees, which is why I’m pushing for a return to our historical role as a leader in refugee resettlement and reform of our existing policies abroad that are causing people to flee their homes for a safer future. Learn about news and information related to Immigration.”

“Before running for office,” says a biography posted on Omar’s website, “she worked as a community educator at the University of Minnesota, was a Policy Fellow at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs and served as a Senior Policy Aide for the Minneapolis City Council.”
