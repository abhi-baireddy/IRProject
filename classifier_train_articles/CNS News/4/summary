Gas prices listed in Girard, Ohio.
It makes sense that when the demand for something is rising relative to the existing supply, prices get pushed higher.
Buyers prefer low prices, while sellers, hoping to earn profits, prefer higher prices.
The resulting glut exerted enormous downward pressure on gas prices.
As a consumer, of course, I prefer to pay lower prices than higher prices for the things I buy.
