Ralph Northam signed a slew of bills into law on Easter weekend, transitioning the Commonwealth into the liberal bastion that Democrats want it to be.
On Sunday, Northam signed legislation expanding early voting to 45 days before an election without a stated excuse; repealing the state's voter ID law; and making Election Day a holiday.
“Every Virginian deserves access to a fair and equitable criminal justice system,” said Governor Northam.
Northam said Confederate monuments "tell a particular version of history that doesn’t include everyone,” Governor Northam said.
Northam signed the Virginia Reproductive Health Protection Act, which repeals "medically-unnecessary restrictions on women’s healthcare," including ultrasound requirements and 24-hour waiting periods for abortion.
