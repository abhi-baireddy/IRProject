Hostile reporters had to face up to their past comments they’re now contradicting when President Donald Trump surprised them with a video montage at a White House coronavirus briefing on Monday.

As reporters were accusing him of not reacting quickly or strongly enough to the virus, Trump unveiled a video showing:

Clips of times when liberal media scoffed at both the severity of COVID-19 and Trump’s actions to protect Americans from it, A timeline of Trump’s efforts to combat the coronavirus threat, Democrat and Republican governors praising Pres. Trump for his assistance in their fight to keep their respective states safe from the virus

Trump was admonishing liberal media, particularly The New York Times, for printing fake news about his response to COVID-19 when he introduced the video clip, walking off stage and leaving reporters to eat their own words.

CNN, apparently, couldn't take the heat, cutting away from the briefing as the video began.
