But the herd immunity provided by a vaccine is at least 18 months away, the experts have estimated.
On Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News that COVID-19 is unlikely to go away on its own:I have to tell you the degree of efficiency of transmissibility in this is really unprecedented in anything I've seen.
Host Laura Ingraham noted that there is no vaccine for HIV/AIDS or even SARS, but "life did go on."
