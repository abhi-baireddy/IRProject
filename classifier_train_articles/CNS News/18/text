(CNSNews.com) - Former Vice President Joe Biden sent out a tweet on Tuesday stating that he had “read the Constitution.”

“I am not running for office to be King of America,” he said.

“I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution,” he said.

“I’ve sworn an oath to it many times,” he said. “I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors—Democratic and Republican—are doing under these horrific circumstances.”

Biden’s tweet included a tweet from CNN that focused on President Trump.

It said: “President Trump lashed out at criticism of his handling of the coronavirus crisis during a grievance-fueled appearance at the White House that featured a propaganda-like video he said was produced by his aides.”
