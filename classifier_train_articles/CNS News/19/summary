“In light of Taiwan’s efforts on coronavirus, Beijing’s opposition & its cover-up, the U.S. needs to consider again extending full diplomatic recognition to Taiwan,” Bolton tweeted.
Eight years later, President Jimmy Carter cut ties with Taiwan and recognized the PRC.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province that will ultimately be reincorporated into “one China” – by force if necessary.
It refuses to have diplomatic relations with the handful of small countries that still have diplomatic ties with the island democracy.
