Journalist and Political Analyst Geraldo Rivera says President Donald Trump’s plan to reopen the U.S. economy unveiled Thursday “seems reasonable” – though it does contain one item he’s personally disappointed by.

In a Friday tweet, Rivera noted a flaw in Trump’s otherwise “thoughtful, measured plan” to get the economy going:

“@realDonaldTrump yesterday presented his thoughtful, measured plan to reopen the nation state by state, step by step. “Plan seems reasonable even though bars will remain closed - a personal disappointment - but not a deal breaker.”

Indeed, the president’s plan to reopen the U.S. contains three phases, each of which affects the operation of bars. Phase One requires bars to remain closed, while Phase Two and Phase Three loosen restrictions:

Phase One: “BARS should remain closed.” Phase Two: “BARS may operate with diminished standing-room occupancy, where applicable and appropriate.” Phase Three: “BARS may operate with increased standing room occupancy, where applicable.”

To qualify for Phase One under the plan, states must meet a comprehensive list of work, social distancing and travel criteria. Phase Two is “For States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a second time,” while the Phase Three category is comprised of “States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a third time.”
