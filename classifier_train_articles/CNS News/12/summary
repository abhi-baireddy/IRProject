When she pulled open the freezer it turned out to be packed with packages of Jeni’s ice cream.
“I have a lot of energy and we just got it restocked, the ice cream, for Easter Sunday, because, shall we say, we were enjoying.
“I don’t know what I would have done were ice cream not invented,” said Pelosi.
“I just wonder.”On its website, Jeni’s advertises pints of multiple flavors of ice cream for $12 per pint.
