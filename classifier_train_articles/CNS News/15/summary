“Systemic racism has *been* killing Black and brown people in America and #COVID19 has only shined a light on the inequities in our country,” said Omar in her tweet.
“I won’t stop pushing for policies that actively dismantle racist institutions,” she said.
Her tweet forwarded a tweet by another individual that said: “Covid 19 does not disproportionately impact Black people.
American capitalism and our healthcare system target Black people, leading to Covid infection.
