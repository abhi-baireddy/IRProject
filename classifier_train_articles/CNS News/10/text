House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif.) has posted the entire text of a story about her that ran in the New York Times yesterday on her official congressional website.

The story is headlined: “Live From Her Kitchen, Pelosi Works to Counter Trump’s Coronavirus Show.”

“Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t bother watching President Trump’s lengthy daily televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic,” says the lead paragraph in the story Pelosi reposted. “‘I don’t watch his shows,’ she said in an interview Wednesday. ‘I don’t have time to watch him contradict himself from one day to the next.’”

“Still,” the New York Times’s story continues, “Ms. Pelosi, who is now deprived of the official trapping of the Capitol with Congress in an extended virus-instigated recess, is trying to counter the president’s White House sessions with her own media blitz from her kitchen in San Francisco.”

“Ms. Pelosi is conducting interviews in front of a laptop in her well-appointed kitchen, with her high-end appliances in the background,” says the Times.

“If he [Trump] tells more falsehoods, if he conveys more falsehoods again and again, they almost become factoids—not quite a fact,” Pelosi is quoted as saying in this Times story she reposted in full. “He is eclipsing the truth, and you cannot let somebody who is not telling the truth say it so often.”
