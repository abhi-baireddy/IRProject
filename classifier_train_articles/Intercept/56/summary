As the black market trade of its N95 respirator masks has continued to swell, pressure is mounting on 3M, which manufactures the masks and other protective gear, to crack down on price gouging among its distributors.
In a statement about both price gouging and the sale of counterfeit masks, which also appears to be a problem, 3M promised that it â€œwill aggressively pursue third-parties that seek to take advantage of this crisis.
The group has a history of working on issues such as jobs, criminal justice, education, and housing.
Among the suppliers they identified was a Canadian distributor who claimed last week to have millions of N95 masks, but demanded a minimum purchase of 20 million.
While it is still exploring how to help purchase managers find supplies, Metro IAF has pivoted since that and other deals fell through.
