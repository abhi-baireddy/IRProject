Two Florida poll workers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus since the March 17 primary, which was held contrary to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against large gatherings to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Both of the workers were stationed at polls in Broward County, in the southeast part of the state.
A spokesperson for the Broward County Supervisor of Elections said on Thursday that all 16 poll workers who worked alongside the workers who tested positive have been contacted by the supervisor’s office.
In Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county, 80 polling locations were eliminated because they didn’t have the supplies needed to keep them clean.
And nearly 50 housing facilities for low-income seniors were used as polling locations, putting a high-risk population at greater risk.
