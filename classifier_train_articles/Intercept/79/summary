In late March, she announced that she was mounting a bid for Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, aiming to unseat one of the oldest and most powerful Democratic members, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last month said it would cut off vendors that work with primary challengers.
Hoyer has not faced a serious primary challenger in years, and, in that sense, Wilkes is entering into unknown political territory.
Thomas Middleton, for example, lives in a majority-white district but one that’s majority black in the Democratic primary.
The newer folks don’t have that kind of allegiance to Hoyer or anyone.”The state’s increasingly younger electorate could also hurt Hoyer, McLaurin added.
