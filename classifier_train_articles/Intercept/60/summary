But a review of recent government contracts related to the coronavirus shows the response of federal agencies to the global pandemic is on a much slower timeline.
The president, who has previously predicted that new coronavirus infections will “miraculously” abate as the weather becomes warmer, explained that his aggressive schedule for reopening the country is in keeping with the nation’s character.
Without them, experts predict, the number of excess coronavirus infections could climb into the millions.
Many of the contracts they’ve recently issued for supplies related to the pandemic won’t be awarded until after Easter.
A federal contract between Veterans Affairs headquarters and the consulting firm McKinsey & Company also reflects a far slower pace than the president’s.
