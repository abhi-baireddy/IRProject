In Ohio, state lawmakers approved a plan to hold an extended, vote-by-mail primary election through April 28, while shutting down almost all in-person voting.
Now, out of necessity, Ohio has joined the handful of states that already primarily conduct elections by mail.
Instead, Ohio gave voters just over a month to apply for a ballot and mail it in.
“You can’t just blink your eyes and have an all vote-by-mail election, it doesn’t work that way,” Miller said.
Some grocery stores are also letting people pick up absentee ballot applications through an initiative from the secretary of state, Frank LaRose, and the Ohio Grocers Association.
