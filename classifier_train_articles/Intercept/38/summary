Prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, coordinator of the Car Wash task force, participates in a debate held at the headquarters of the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo, on Oct. 24, 2017.
On the same day that his group discussed Moro’s posture in the Queiroz and Flávio case, Dallagnol used a private chat to discuss the same topic with another Car Wash prosecutor, Roberson Pozzobon.
In the past, Car Wash prosecutors were never shy about forcefully denouncing the invocation of this congressional privilege when it came to other politicians charged with corruption.
Thus, we will also mention F. Bolsonaro’s case, that came up after we began working on the report.
The idea that Moro was eager to protect Jair Bolsonaro’s son, or at least eager to avoid his investigation, was expressed again in the prosecutors’ chat groups in mid-January.
