Gretchen Whitmer said that while convenience stores count as “essential,” their lottery sales should not, and suggested she would look “very seriously” at restricting them.
The many critics of state lotteries find their continued operation perverse.
(The Michigan Lottery says an estimated 9 percent of lottery sales go back to retailers as commission, a higher figure than in many other states.)
Instead, “we’re sitting here talking about how to maximize sales.”But as long as state lotteries are considered essential, at least some of their staffers will have to report to work.
State lotteries have also been accused of taking from the poor to fund programs that do not proportionately benefit them in return.
