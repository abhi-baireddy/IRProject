This time around, even as the candidates have launched new bids for office, the party committee is taking a hands-off approach.
In 2018, the DCCC similarly deemed a handful of races unwinnable, yet the candidates nearly won anyway.
In Omaha, Eastman is running again, but the DCCC, whose recruit lost to her in 2018, has its eye on several other potential candidates.
A DCCC spokesperson acknowledged that the party committee is not rallying behind candidates who fell just short in 2018 but said that they are not opposing them, either.
Despite the $300,000 the DCCC spent on the general election, Rhoades said she felt the party committee did not really support Eastman.
