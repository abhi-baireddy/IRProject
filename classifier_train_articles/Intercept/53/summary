In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, a House Intelligence Committee staffer named Diane Roark was assigned to handle the committee’s oversight of the National Security Agency.
Roark developed excellent contacts inside the NSA and soon discovered that in the weeks after 9/11, the agency had launched a secret, illegal program to spy on Americans.
Roark wrote a memo warning the committee’s leadership about the new domestic spying program.
She was certain that the chair and ranking member would order an investigation as soon as she told them about it.
Sitting in Burr’s congressional office, Roark and the others told Burr in detail what they knew about the NSA program.
