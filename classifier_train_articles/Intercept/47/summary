The California company that evicted a group of homeless mothers from a West Oakland, California, home this week is the force behind a sprawling national home-flipping operation.
Early Tuesday morning, sheriff’s deputies evicted the group Moms 4 Housing, who were occupying a foreclosed, investor-owned home in West Oakland.
But where housing activists once faced off against major banks, they’re increasingly coming up against faceless corporations operating with even less transparency.
Moms 4 Housing supporters protest in front of a vacant house in West Oakland, Calif., on Jan. 13, 2020.
Operating through a maze of subsidiaries, they flooded the housing market to buy up cheap, foreclosed homes nationwide.
