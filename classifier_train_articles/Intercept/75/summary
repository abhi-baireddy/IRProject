Republicans are outmaneuvering Democratic Party leaders with their plans to put cash directly into the pockets of working Americans in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
At a House Democratic caucus meeting last week, Pelosi opposed proposals to send immediate cash payments because she didn’t want them to go to rich people.
“Which is a strange opposition to it, because rich people don’t want $1,000,” said one House Democratic staffer, who asked for anonymity.
The chamber is working on another plan to pass additional measures to send immediate cash to families.
Cotton rolled out an official plan on Tuesday to immediately send $1,000 checks to every person making under $100,000.
