You had her fellow CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who’s normally pretty good on Trump, say this:Jim Acosta: This was a different Donald Trump tonight.
So I don’t know how you can imbue him with the sense of today, he’s got a somber tone, it’s just silly.
Everybody has written a book about President Trump, right?
But I think his tone is going to be fine because I don’t think people want the person who’s going to punch back.
I don’t think giving him more airtime necessarily is always going to be helpful for him.
