“In about two-thirds of the states, there already is no-excuse absentee balloting,” Hasen pointed out in a Skype interview on Monday.
Wyden’s home state of Oregon has conducted general elections entirely by mail since 2000 , when turnout spiked to 79 percent.
Every state that hasn't adopted universal voting by mail should do so immediately to ensure the coronavirus doesn't disrupt election operations.
“We’re going to need more federal funding because you’re going to need scanners, you’re going to need employees checking these ballots.
That will likely mean delays in mail delivery times, which should not disqualify votes cast by election day.
