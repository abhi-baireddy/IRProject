Morgan Harper, the 36-year-old progressive running for Congress in Ohio’s 3rd Congressional District raised a remarkable $323,000 during the first quarter of her campaign, setting her up for a potent primary challenge to 69-year-old Rep. Joyce Beatty, a four-term incumbent.

Harper’s campaign has raised the fourth-largest amount of money among any first-time congressional primary challenger in the initial quarter of their campaign, according to data provided by Data for Progress.
Harper’s campaign fundraising prowess was made possible by a strong ground operation, she told The Intercept.
“All those things just amplified awareness nationally and really increased the number of small donors,” Harper told The Intercept.
