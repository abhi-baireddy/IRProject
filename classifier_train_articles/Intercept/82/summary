Last Sunday, The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil published a series of exposés that has created a major political earthquake in Brazil that has only grown and intensified throughout the week.
In less than a week, the once-revered justice minister of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government, Sérgio Moro, now faces widespread calls to resign from the same large Brazilian media outlets that spent years transforming him into an untouchable icon of integrity and uncritically applauding his every move.
Even more grave, the improprieties revealed by our reporting have cast serious doubt on the validity of numerous guilty verdicts issued by Moro and the anti-corruption task force, beginning — most importantly — with the conviction and imprisonment of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last year at the exact same time that he was the overwhelming frontrunner to win the presidency in 2018.
That conviction by Moro, which we now know was the byproduct of highly improper and unethical conduct, is now scheduled to be reviewed by the Brazil Supreme Court as early as next week.
