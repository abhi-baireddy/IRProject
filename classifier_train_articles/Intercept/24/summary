Morales fled Bolivia after the commander in chief of the military asked for his resignation on November 10, 2019.
The crisis in Bolivia mirrors the 2009 coup in Honduras in many ways.
Morales and Zelaya both forged ties with Venezuela, raised the minimum wage, expanded social services, and opposed the privatization of major industries.
The lobbying firm, previously known as Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associates, provided remarkably similar work after Zelaya’s ouster, helping the interim Honduran government earn backing from American policymakers and media outlets as the country held new elections.
The Áñez government has retained the services of the same Washington, D.C., consultants hired by the Honduran interim government to build American support.
