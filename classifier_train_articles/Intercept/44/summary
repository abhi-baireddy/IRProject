On Sunday, Rep. Ro Khanna urged a massive increase in funding for the Defense Production Act.
But the act, as written, is modest, applying caps of $50 million to each individual contract and a fund of $750 million.
At $1,800 per, the cost could run to over $50 billion.
But as a $1.8 trillion bipartisan coronavirus stimulus bill races toward passage, it is unclear if the legislation will include any firm appropriations for the Defense Production Act.
There is a cap of $750 million on the Defense Production Act fund, and orders above $50 million must be approved by Congress.
