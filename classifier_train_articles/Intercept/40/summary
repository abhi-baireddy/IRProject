On February 28, Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez drove to Academia Avance, a small charter academy, to drop off two of his daughters at school.
After dropping off one daughter, Romulo was pulled over by ICE agents, who were unaware that 13-year-old Fatima was still in the backseat.
Over uncontrollable sobs, Fatima filmed the arrest with her cellphone.
He also purchased a used car nearly 20 years ago, without knowing it bore a registration sticker that had been stolen from another car.
Romulo’s story has received international media attention, probably because of the video Fatima shot from the backseat of her dad’s car.
