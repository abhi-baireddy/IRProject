On Monday afternoon, the Food and Drug Administration granted Gilead Sciences “orphan” drug status for its antiviral drug, remdesivir.
Hours later, the FDA gave the drug orphan status.
Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir was developed with at least $79 million in U.S. government funding, according to a paper published last week by KEI.
Although the Orphan Drug Act was designed to solve a real problem — a lack of treatments for uncommon illnesses — pharmaceutical companies have for years exploited it for gain.
And companies have extended their exclusive marketing rights by repurposing drugs that are already patented for other purposes to treat rare diseases.
