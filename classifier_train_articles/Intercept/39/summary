Until now, the only downturn of note in total worldwide CO2 emissions during the era of climate awareness — defined as the period beginning in 1995 with the first U.N.
Climate Change Conference — was in 2009, the onset of the Great Recession.
Is it cruel to point approvingly to the steep reduction in carbon emissions now unfolding, given the skyrocketing deaths, lost livelihoods, and widespread privation?

The contraction of the U.S. economy this year could purge 30 to 40 percent of carbon emissions we would otherwise spew.
