Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is in Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.
In February, Flávio’s direct and intimate ties to militias became even more glaring.
Since then, those militias have taken over huge swaths of Brazil’s most critical cities, including Rio.
But almost immediately after the police announced the identity of the two assassins they arrested, ties to Bolsonaro emerged.
Ronnie Lessa, lives on the same street as Bolsonaro’s Rio house, in an exclusive gated community: an extreme coincidence given how massive and sprawling of a city Rio de Janeiro is.
