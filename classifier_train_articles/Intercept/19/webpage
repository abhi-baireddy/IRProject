<p>Since the Centers for Disease Control <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/Chloroquine.pdf">says on its website</a> that the active ingredient in the antimalarial drug referred to as choloroquine is chloroquine phosphate, it is not hard to see how desperate, worried people with access to the internet but no medical knowledge could convince themselves to swallow a form of that chemical used to kill parasites on fish, even if it was labeled &#8220;not for human consumption.&#8221;</p></div><div class="img-wrap align-center width-fixed" style="width:1000px;" data-reactid="233"><div data-reactid="234"><a href="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-24-at-3.22.33-PM.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90"><img src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-24-at-3.22.33-PM-1000x609.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90" alt="" class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-297397" /></a>

<p>At the same news conference, Trump also downplayed <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/20/trump-disagrees-top-immunologist-untested-drug-treatment-covid-19/">warnings from Dr. Anthony Fauci</a>, the nation&#8217;s top immunologist, who said that even though the drug is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, without large scale, randomized clinical trials, it was not yet possible to be sure that chloroquine was effective or safe for people suffering from Covid-19, the pandemic respiratory illness. While chloroquine was only rarely dangerous for people with malaria, Fauci said, &#8220;what we don’t know, is when you put it in the context of another disease, whether it’s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re trying to strike a balance,&#8221; Fauci said, &#8220;between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump ignored that caution and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501">tweeted</a> that a combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, and the antibiotic azithromycin &#8212; which was administered to six patients who recovered from Covid-19 this month in France &#8212; has &#8220;a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The president is talking about hope for people,&#8221; Fauci said when asked about the tweet at a briefing on Saturday. &#8220;My job, as a scientist,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is to ultimately prove, without a doubt, that a drug is not only safe by that it actually works.&#8221; </p>
<p>The preliminary research touted by Trump was conducted by Professor Didier Raoult, a French virologist who directs the Mediterranean Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute in Marseille. According to a non-peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf">draft paper</a> posted online last week, Raoult and his colleagues began treating 26 Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine earlier this month. After six days, 14 of them &#8220;were virologicaly cured,&#8221; including six who were also treated with azithromycin, compared to just two of a control group of 16 patients who did not get the drugs. </p>
<p>Raoult&#8217;s claim that the study proves the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine on Covid-19 has been <a href="https://blogs.mediapart.fr/olivierbelli/blog/220320/pr-raoult-and-chloroquine-beware-lone-wolf">questioned</a> for its very small size and some odd choices in how it was conducted. Then there is the fact that six of the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had adverse reactions within three days: one died, three were removed from the study when they were transferred to intensive care, one tested negative for the virus and one stopped the treatment because of nausea. Those failures were simply dropped from the study&#8217;s statistics.</p></div><div class="VideoEmbed VideoEmbed--size-medium" data-reactid="242"><div class="VideoEmbedPlayer VideoEmbedPlayer--youtube" style="padding-bottom:56.25%;" data-reactid="243"><div class="VideoEmbedPlayer-container" data-reactid="244"><div class="VideoEmbedPlayer-player" data-reactid="245"></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="246"><p class='caption'>An English-language interview with Professor Didier Raoult, a French virologist who directs the Mediterranean Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute in Marseille, about his experimental use of hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html#r7">described</a> Raoult&#8217;s work as &#8220;a small study&#8221; that reported &#8220;hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin reduced detection of&#8221; the coronavirus &#8220;in upper respiratory tract specimens compared with a non-randomized control group but did not assess clinical benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Matthew Herper of Stat News <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/22/why-trump-at-odds-with-medical-experts-over-malaria-drugs-against-covid-19/">explained</a>, &#8220;three-quarters of the time, medicines against infectious disease that looked promising in small studies either were ineffective or had side effects that made them unusable&#8221; after larger clinical trials.</p>
<p>The results in France were contradicted by those of another small study in China, which indicated that hydroxychloroquine was no more effective than other treatments for Covid-19. As <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/antimalarial-drug-no-better-standard-coronavirus-care-study-172249597.html">AFP reported</a> on Wednesday, the Chinese study, <a href="http://subject.med.wanfangdata.com.cn/UpLoad/Files/202003/43f8625d4dc74e42bbcf24795de1c77c.pdf">published</a> in the Journal of Zhejiang University, involved treating half of a group of 30 Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine for seven days. After a week of treatment, 13 of the 15 patients given the malaria drug tested negative for the coronavirus; but so did 14 of the 15 Covid-19 patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>Raoult, <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?u=https%3A//www.nouvelobs.com/coronavirus-de-wuhan/20200323.OBS26473/qui-est-didier-raoult-le-medecin-qui-veut-imposer-la-chloroquine-pour-combattre-le-covid-19.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8">a self-described maverick</a> who bears a passing resemblance to Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump&#8217;s former personal physician, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/coronavirus-france-hoping-unorthodox-virologist-can-save-world-1.4210278">based his work</a> on research done in China earlier this year. </p>
<p>Researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0">reported</a> that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit infections of the novel coronavirus in lab conditions. As the CDC notes, the researchers in China &#8220;reported that chloroquine treatment of Covid-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group,&#8221; which led to the drug being recommended as an antiviral treatment there.</p>
<p>According to the French newsweekly <a href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/coronavirus-de-wuhan/20200323.OBS26473/qui-est-didier-raoult-le-medecin-qui-veut-imposer-la-chloroquine-pour-combattre-le-covid-19.html">Le Nouvel Observateur</a>, while he is the most influential microbiologist in France, Raoult&#8217;s outsized personality and love of a fight colors how his work is perceived by peers and public health officials. A climate change denier, he has scoffed at the global response to the pandemic, saying the virus &#8220;does not justify measures worthy of an atomic catastrophe.&#8221; </p>
<p>His scorn for this sort of approach to pandemics is not new. Epidemic modelers, like those whose work <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html">prompted</a> the current shutdown of public life in the United Kingdom and the United States, are &#8220;charlatans,&#8221; he <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/news-summaries">told Science magazine</a> in 2012. &#8220;There are zero examples in infectious diseases of something that has been predicted by a model,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Raoult even has a new book about the coronavirus out this week, &#8220;<a href="http://www.michel-lafon.fr/livre/2415-Epidemies_Vrais_dangers_et_fausses_alertes.html">Epidemics, Real Dangers and False Alarms</a>,&#8221; in which he argues that &#8220;this panic is largely due to the exaggerations of the press, which knows that fear &#8216;sells.'&#8221; Rather than universal confinement, Raoult suggests, a better response would be to emulate South Korea &#8212; <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c0755b30-69bb-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3?sharetype=blocked">and Germany</a> &#8212; by ramping up testing so much that infected individuals can be identified and isolated, cutting the death toll.</p>
<p>As the Irish Times correspondent Lara Marlowe <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/coronavirus-france-hoping-unorthodox-virologist-can-save-world-1.4210278">noted</a>, Raoult &#8220;shares a certain arrogance with Trump&#8221; and Brazil&#8217;s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/coronavirus-bolsonaro-accused-of-disinformation-over-possible-cure-1.4209267">ordered</a> the nation&#8217;s army to produce mass quantities of chloroquine on Saturday. &#8220;In my field, I am a star, worldwide,&#8221; he told the newspaper La Provence. &#8220;I don’t give a damn what others think. I am not an outsider. I&#8217;m streaks ahead of the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Trump and Bolsonaro, Raoult&#8217;s contrarianism also extends to <a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/invites-du-point/didier_raoult/les-predictions-climatiques-sont-absurdes-08-10-2013-1740365_445.php">scoffing at</a> predictions of climate catastrophe and is a less-than-stellar boss. A dozen subordinates in the institute he runs signed <a href="https://sntrscgt.vjf.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/courrier_ita_unite_raoult_marseille.pdf">a letter of complaint</a> in 2017 saying they were &#8220;frequently belittled, mocked, humiliated, subjected to macho talk, inappropriate attitudes and verbal altercations.&#8221; A <a href="https://youtu.be/mJl2nPHAo2g">video interview</a> posted on his institute&#8217;s YouTube channel begins with Raoult boasting of his high-ranking on a website called <a href="https://przen.com/pr/prof-didier-raoult-discusses-coronavirus-and-chloroquine-przen-33336577">Expertscape</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Trump and Bolsonaro are not the only people anxious to find out if chloroquine might work.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-accepts">announced</a> that the state had obtained 750,000 doses of chloroquine, 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine and 10,000 doses of azithromycin and would undertake its own drug trial.</p>
<p>Amid reports that the drug is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/23/820228658/why-hoarding-of-hydroxychloroquine-needs-to-stop">already being hoarded</a>, Cuomo issued <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20210-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency">an executive order</a> on Monday barring any experimental use of the drug outside state-approved trials. &#8220;No pharmacist shall dispense hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine except when written as prescribed for an FDA-approved indication; or as part of a state approved clinical trial related to Covid-19 for a patient who has tested positive for Covid-19, with such test result documented as part of the prescription,&#8221; the order said. &#8220;No other experimental or prophylactic use shall be permitted, and any permitted prescription is limited to one fourteen day prescription with no refills.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is studying possible drug treatments for Covid-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/science/coronavirus-drugs-chloroquine.html">told The New York Times</a> that doctors &#8220;need to be careful&#8221; with chloroquine because the drug seems to target many human cellular proteins and could have many toxic side effects.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Fauci, the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, gave <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/i-m-going-keep-pushing-anthony-fauci-tries-make-white-house-listen-facts-pandemic">an interview</a> to Science magazine in which he described the difficulty of keeping Trump from saying things that are not true during briefings. &#8220;I can&#8217;t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,&#8221; Fauci said.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, the government&#8217;s most senior immunologist was attacked on Fox News by Steve Hilton, a former adviser to David Cameron, the British prime minister who introduced sweeping austerity measures. Hilton, who supported massive cuts to social programs in Britain when he was in government, accused Fauci and other public health officials of &#8220;pushing us towards another Great Depression.&#8221;</p></div><div data-reactid="247"><div data-reactid="248"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I suspect that Trump all-caps tweet is a livetweet of Fox from tonight (though obviously <a href="https://twitter.com/MattGertz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MattGertz</a> would know for sure).

Before you go</span><span class="InlineDonationPromo-text" data-reactid="258"> on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it?

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat?

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That’s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</span><a class="InlineDonationPromo-link InlineDonationPromo-link--en" href="https://join.theintercept.com/donate/now?referrer_post_id=296721&amp;source=web_intercept_in-article-long-2020-03-09" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-reactid="259"><span data-reactid="260">Become&nbsp;a&nbsp;Member&nbsp;</span><span class="Icon Icon--Arrow_02_Right icon-TI_Arrow_02_Right" data-reactid="261"></span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="Post-contact Post-contact--1" data-reactid="262"><h4 class="Post-contact-header" data-reactid="263"><!-- react-text: 264 -->Contact the author<!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="265">:</span></h4><div class="Post-contact-author" data-reactid="266"><a class="" href="/staff/robertmackey/" data-reactid="267"><img class="Post-contact-author-image" src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/04/r_3eMQ-M_400x400-1523651274.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90" data-reactid="268"/></a><p class="Post-contact-details" data-reactid="269"><a class="Post-contact-link Post-contact-link--name" href="/staff/robertmackey/" data-reactid="270">Robert Mackey</a><a class="Post-contact-link" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e99b868b8c9b9dc784888a828c90a99d818c80879d8c9b8a8c999dc78a8684" data-reactid="271"><span class="Icon Icon--Envelope icon-TI_Envelope" data-reactid="272"></span><!-- react-text: 273 --><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="72001d101700065c1f131119170b32">[email&#160;protected]</span>​theintercept.com<!-- /react-text --></a><a class="Post-contact-link" href="//twitter.com/@RobertMackey" target="_blank" data-reactid="274"><span class="Icon Icon--Twitter icon-TI_Twitter" data-reactid="275"></span><!-- react-text: 276 -->@RobertMackey<!-- /react-text --></a></p></div></div><!-- react-empty: 277 --><div class="RelatedPosts" data-reactid="278"><h4 class="RelatedPosts-header" data-reactid="279"><span data-reactid="280">Related</span></h4><div class="RelatedPosts-promo" data-reactid="281"><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-treatment-orphan-drug-status/" data-reactid="282"><div class="RelatedPosts-promo-link-thumbnail" data-reactid="283"><img height="440" src="https://theintercept-static.imgix.net/usq/a375c2d1-f7f5-4cfb-a747-6edc9de395a8/a375c2d1-f7f5-4cfb-a747-6edc9de395a8.bin?auto=compress,format&amp;cs=srgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=440&amp;w=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Cedges&amp;_=7a38cc5df80e9acd9f0f86999cff3429" width="440" data-reactid="284"/></div><h4 class="RelatedPosts-promo-link-title" data-reactid="285">Coronavirus Treatment Developed by Gilead Sciences Granted “Rare Disease” Status, Potentially Limiting Affordability</h4></a></div><div class="RelatedPosts-promo" data-reactid="286"><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/richard-burr-coronavirus-stocks/" data-reactid="287"><div class="RelatedPosts-promo-link-thumbnail" data-reactid="288"><img height="440" src="https://theintercept-static.imgix.net/usq/fb3fa9d9-afa7-4f26-a84f-8c03f2c086eb/fb3fa9d9-afa7-4f26-a84f-8c03f2c086eb.bin?auto=compress,format&amp;cs=srgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=440&amp;w=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Cedges&amp;_=a9dbb97a26e2ead6f54bbf0c135295bc" width="440" data-reactid="289"/></div><h4 class="RelatedPosts-promo-link-title" data-reactid="290">After 9/11, Richard Burr Selfishly Ignored a Tip About Domestic Spying.
