The following dispatch was sent by a nurse who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect their job.
The first I heard any communication from anyone about precautions for coronavirus were small, colored signs asking patients and visitors to â€œStop!
We are thanked for our hard work and are assured that we are fully prepared to handle patients with Covid-19.
As we receive these patients, their information and diagnosis will remain confidential; we will not be making any public statement about COVID-19 to protect patient privacy.
This is NOT about patient privacy.
