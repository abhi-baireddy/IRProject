A dramatic, multi-level, and increasingly dark scandal has been engulfing the Brazilian presidency of Jair Bolsonaro for the last month.
It began just weeks after his stunning November victory but before he was inaugurated on January 1, and has completely paralyzed his presidency ever since.
The scandal began with the discovery of highly suspicious payments into and out of the account of Flávio’s driver, a former police officer and long-time friend of the president’s.
But two recent events have converted what looked to be a classic scandal of money laundering and kickbacks into something much more ominous and terrifying.
Prior to Wyllys’s stunning announcement, we began work on a short video documenting the key facts of this genuinely shocking scandal that has paralyzed the Bolsonaro presidency before it could even begin and, today, drove the country’s only LGBT Congress member not only from office, but from the country.
