On Friday, the two figures behind CNN Brasil — Menin and Tavolaro — met with Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo at the presidential palace.
CNN Brasil said it plans to hire 400 journalists and begin operations during the second half of 2019.

Menin, who will fund CNN Brasil, has been repeatedly accused of profiting off workers in situations analogous to slave labor.
(A spokesperson for CNN Brasil told The Intercept that Macedo has no connection to the new network.)
