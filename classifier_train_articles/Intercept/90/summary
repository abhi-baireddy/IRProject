Activists are calling for ecocide to be recognized as an international crime, on a par with war crimes and genocide, prosecutable by the International Criminal Court.
Efforts to see ecocide recognized by the ICC are two-fold: either that ecocide be included under crimes against humanity, or established as its own separate Crime Against Peace.
The moral grounds are clear for enumerating ecocide among the most serious international crimes.
The idea that ecocide be recognized as an international crime predates the formation of the ICC itself.
