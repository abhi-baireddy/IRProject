Without mitigation, the new coronavirus pandemic could kill as many as 2.2 million people in the U.S., according to a report from the Imperial College of London Covid-19 Response Team.
Ironically, as economies shut down in response to the global spread of the virus, air quality is actually improving during the pandemic.
Nitrogen dioxide also harms the heart, driving up rates of heart attack, stroke, acute heart failure, and death from heart disease overall.
But the recent dips in air pollution levels come too late to help those already sick with Covid-19.
Communities that usually have high levels of air pollution also have high levels of health problems that put them at particular risk of dying from the virus.
