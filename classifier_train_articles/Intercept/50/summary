Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, has been “appreciative,” Trump said.
“We’ve had a big problem with the young, a woman governor from — you know who I’m talking about — from Michigan,” Trump told Hannity.
“Now she wants a declaration of emergency and, you know, we’ll have to make a decision on that,” Trump said.
Before calling it a day on Friday, Trump approved major disaster declarations for South Carolina and Puerto Rico, but not Michigan.
