On January 3, 2020, Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC's) elite Quds Force, was targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike.
The Quds Force played a significant role in training the Taliban, Hizballah of Lebanon, as well as Shi’ite militias in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hussein and Soleimani, an Identical PairSoleimani’s death rattled Iran for a number of cultural and religious reasons related to the country’s Shi’ite Muslim history.
Some of the imagery that quickly began circulating online depicted Soleimani as a shahid (martyr).
In another Twitter statement, Khamenei asserted “Martyrdom was the reward for [Soleimani’s] ceaseless efforts in all these years,” and declared three days of mourning following his death.
