In New York City, a city that has largely lost its white working class, the white multigenerational numbers are far lower.
That is a group that is far less vulnerable to the coronavirus than the older multigenerational black families living in the Bronx.
But the coronavirus is also killing the remaining multigenerational white communities in the area.
