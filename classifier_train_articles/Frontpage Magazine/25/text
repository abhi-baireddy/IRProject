Good news.

Joe Biden will run on a unity theme that half the country is a bunch of racists and he doesn't expect to win their votes.

Asked at a virtual fundraiser Wednesday evening if he was hopeful he could reach the commander in chief’s staunchest backers, the former vice president remarked with a laugh, “His base? Probably not.” “There are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of division. They really support the notion that, you know, all Mexicans are rapists and all Muslims are bad and…dividing this nation based on ethnicity, race,” the 2020 hopeful continued, “This is the one of the few presidents who succeeded by deliberately trying to divide the country not unite the country.”

A guy named Obama springs to mind. Perhaps Biden has heard of him.

Also does, "they gonna put y'all back in chains" ring any faint and distant bells in the dusty halls of Biden's memories?

The Democrats invented " deliberately trying to divide the country" back in the 19th century. They've just changed whose emotions and passions they play on.

Biden playing identity politics hits while complaining that President Trump is dividing the country is the embodiment of the political hypocrisy of a radical movement that keeps accusing half the country of racism and their opponents of disiveness.
