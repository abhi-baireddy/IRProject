The official reason for the unprecedented closure of much of the United States in response to COVID-19 is that lives matter.
Consider the three leading causes of preventable deaths in the US: about 480,000 Americans die from smoking (some from secondhand), 300,000 die from obesity, and 88,000 die from alcohol, every single year.
But then COVID-19 came, and suddenly our elected officials have seen the light; suddenly no sacrifice is too great if it can save lives.
After all, doing so would save millions of American lives each and every year—as opposed to just 240,000 “potential” lives from COVID-19; and that, of course, is the whole point of the current clampdown, right?
So what’s a few billion dollars in lost tax revenues compared to saving millions of American lives every year?
