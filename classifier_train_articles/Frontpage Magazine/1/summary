How do you solve a problem like Joe Biden?
So, how do you solve a problem like Joe Biden?
Here’s my simple but elegant solution: replace Biden with an Audio-Animatronics version of himself, and call it Robo-Joe.
If he’s elected, they may decide to install him in the White House and put the Real Joe out to pasture.
If they create a set that looks like the Oval Office, Real Joe will never know the difference.
