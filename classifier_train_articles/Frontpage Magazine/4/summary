Queen Margrethe of Denmark turns 80 today, and to commemorate the occasion she gave an interview that appeared in the newspaper Politiken on Saturday.
In a 2016 interview with Der Spiegel, Margrethe rued the fact that EU enthusiasts “forget that Europe is a conglomerate of different entities – in other words, countries.
Surely no living monarch has been remotely as honest and gutsy as Margrethe has been on the topic of Islam.
I’m no monarchist, but I know that if Margrethe actually wielded executive power, things would be different.
Happy birthday to her; long may she reign.
