Senility or evil plan?

The tipoff is that Biden mentions "global warming". Contemporary lefties like to call the old scam, "climate change." Lefty politics, like any scam, requires changing the name every decade or so to shake up the brand and convince the public that this is a new scam.

On the one hand, this is a CNN panel pushing the injection of radical socialist policies under the guise of fighting the coronavirus. On the other hand, Biden gets easily confused when putting on his pants.

And so the game, "evil or senile" goes on.
