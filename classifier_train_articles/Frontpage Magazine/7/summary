Let's first let's examine what might be the root of academic corruption, suggested by the title of a recent study, "Academic Grievance Studies and the Corruption of Scholarship."
They call these fields "grievance studies," where scholarship is not so much based upon finding truth but upon attending to social grievances.
Grievance studies consist of disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, gender studies, queer, sexuality and critical race studies.
All of this is being taught to college students, many of whom become primary and secondary school teachers who then indoctrinate our young people.
Another helpful tool would be to give careful consideration to eliminating all classes/majors/minors containing the word "studies," such as women, Asian, black or queer studies.
