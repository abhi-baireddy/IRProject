CDC mouthpiece Dr. Nancy Messonnier dodges questions from the media.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), fielded questions from the media.
None of the reporters asked if any of the “information from China” had been gathered by the CDC itself.
As the CDC explains, Dr. Messonnier received her BA from the University of Pennsylvania and MD from the University of Chicago School of Medicine.
Craig of KNX radio might wonder if the CDC is leveling with the people about the Wuhan virus the CDC failed to prevent from hitting American soil.
