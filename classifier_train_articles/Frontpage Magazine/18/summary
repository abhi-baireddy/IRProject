In the war against the Wuhan virus, Democrats’ have had a laser focus.
It’s not because of anything the World Health Organization did.
Democrat donor Bill Gates piled on: “Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.” Actually not.
Although China knew the virus was intensely contagious, its officials assured the world that it was not transmittable from human to human.
Just as they have made the World Health Organization a strategic bridge in their designs on the rest of the world.
