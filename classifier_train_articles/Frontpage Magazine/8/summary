While Americans were dying, the Senate Terror Caucus was hard at work… for Iran.
Murphy has spoken at NIAC events and the Iran Lobby group had described the Democrat as a “fearless ally” of its cause.
The Terror Caucus consists of many of the same members who put the interests of terrorists ahead of Americans.
The Democrat Terror Caucus isn’t just selling out this country it’s putting terrorists ahead of Americans.
If this is what the Terror Caucus does during a pandemic, imagine what it will do afterward.
