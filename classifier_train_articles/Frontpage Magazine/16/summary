Leftist DNA runs deep in Venezuela's political culture.
Venezuela's beleaguered president-in-waiting, a leftist at heart, has received considerable support from the Trump administration to achieve a major U.S. policy goal: ease out Venezuela's socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, a stooge of Cuba and Russia.
Guaidó's fruitless quest to assume Venezuela's presidency also has gotten steadfast support from some 60 countries.
Now, Naím enjoys the good life in Washington, D.C. while taking potshots at President Trump.
Unfortunately, Venezuela's mess won't end anytime soon – not with the amount of leftist DNA running through Venezuela's political culture.
