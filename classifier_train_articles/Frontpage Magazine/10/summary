China’s official tally of deaths attributable to the coronavirus stands at 3,341 as of April 14, 2020.
The Chinese government announced on March 19th that over 21 million cell phone accounts in China were canceled in the past three months, according to the News NT article.
Cooper did admit that other sources were reporting the existence of an intelligence report in early April, which concluded that China had deliberately underreported the number of coronavirus cases and related deaths.
Chinese officials manipulated the data from the start, using a variety of definitions as to what constitutes a COVID-19 infection.
The U.S. intelligence report’s explanation buttressing the estimate of millions of coronavirus-related Chinese deaths is far more plausible: “Cell phones are an indispensable part of life in China and its only closed when the user is dead.”
