We’ve reached that point in the Wuhan pandemic when we start talking about how the world will change after the crisis passes.
The media’s performance during the virus crisis has been par for the course in their unhinged zeal to damage the Trump administration, which has made the president’s attempt to handle the crisis even more difficult.

We’ve had over a century of empirical evidence that the foundational assumptions of the “rules-based international order” are flawed.
But either way, the “new world order,” as George Bush senior called it, will not go gently into that good night.
