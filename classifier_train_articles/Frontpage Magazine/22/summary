Coronavirus is an excuse for the pro-crime lobby to do what it had been doing all along, freeing criminals and legalizing crime.
A Florida inmate who was among those released last month in an effort to contain the coronavirus has been arrested on a murder charge, sheriff’s officials said.
Joseph Edward Williams, 26, was arrested Monday on a second-degree murder charge in connection with a fatal shooting March 20, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.
Williams was among a group of inmates released from the jail in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus throughout the facility.
Williams was released to protect him.
