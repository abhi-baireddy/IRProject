The coronavirus jailbreak is underway. Coronavirus is an excuse for the pro-crime lobby to do what it had been doing all along, freeing criminals and legalizing crime. Meanwhile the price is being paid by the victims of the freed criminals.

A Florida inmate who was among those released last month in an effort to contain the coronavirus has been arrested on a murder charge, sheriff’s officials said. Joseph Edward Williams, 26, was arrested Monday on a second-degree murder charge in connection with a fatal shooting March 20, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. He’s also charged with resisting an officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession of heroin, records show. Williams was among a group of inmates released from the jail in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus throughout the facility.

It didn't take much time for Williams, a perfectly wonderful criminal, to commit more crimes. We have jails so that people like Williams can't do that. If you release folks like Williams from prison, crimes will happen. Williams was released to protect him.

The question is, who's protecting us?
