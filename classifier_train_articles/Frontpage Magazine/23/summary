It had been nearly 14 years since Fariz’s conviction for providing material support to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), of which he was a member.
Question: Why would Israel allow such an individual – a convicted terrorist – into her country, especially when Israel had just warred with PIJ?
The mosque was named after Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, the man who was the inspiration for the founding of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Hammoudeh had co-founded the PIJ mosque and children’s school in Temple Terrace.
Permitting Hatem Fariz into Israel is a danger to Israel and her surrounding areas.
