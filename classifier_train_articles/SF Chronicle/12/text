Bay Area hospitals — which are running low on masks, gowns, face shields and other protective equipment needed by health care workers to safely treat coronavirus patients — are accepting donations from manufacturers, companies and the public.

The need for protective gear at hospitals is dire. Some hospitals have only enough supplies for the next two to three weeks, and a surge of COVID-19 patients is expected in the coming weeks.

Nurses have been instructed to reuse masks by disinfecting them with alcohol or Lysol between uses, which makes them less effective. Doctors are preparing to make their own masks from T-shirts and pillowcases.

Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that as a last resort, health care workers could use bandannas and scarves — a guidance that angered many physicians asking why the federal government has not moved faster to increase manufacturing, as is done during wartime and after natural disasters.

Some Bay Area companies, including Facebook and Flexport, have donated stocks of masks and other supplies to local governments for distribution to hospitals.

Experts emphasize that the best thing the public can do to help health care workers is to stay home and not hoard medical supplies.
