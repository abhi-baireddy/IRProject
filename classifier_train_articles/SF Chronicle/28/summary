The Bay Area is not in danger of running out of food, industry members and experts say, and the food supply chain is as healthy as ever.
But despite the rush, the supply chain for food products like fruits, vegetables and meat has not yet been disrupted — even if it’s taking some stores a little longer to restock the shelves.
“Food is not going to run out,” said Karan Girotra, a professor of operations and technology and an expert in supply chain management at Cornell Tech in New York City.
“We’re not seeing any current disruptions in the pork supply chain,” he said.
“But we’re trying to get ahead of it and seeing if we can find solutions to keep workers in plants.”If there is a holdup in the supply chain, it’s due to increased demand, not decreased supply.
