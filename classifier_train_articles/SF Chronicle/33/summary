The coronavirus has made people cook at home more than ever before â€” a fitting time for the Impossible Burger to debut at Bay Area grocery stores.
Redwood City food-tech company Impossible Foods will roll out its incredibly beef-like soy burgers to all Northern California Safeway stores on Friday.
Impossible Foods first entered grocery stores in Los Angeles last fall, and has slowly added outlets on the East Coast.
Plant-based burger rival Beyond Meat in Southern California has had its Beyond Burger in grocery stores for several years, where they usually retail for $5.99 for two 4-ounce patties.
Impossible Foods added a second production line at its Oakland factory specifically for retail, with plans to eventually bring multiple Impossible Foods products to grocery stores.
