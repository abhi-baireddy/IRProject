Corporate leadership is setting aside 47 of its motels in 19 counties to house homeless residents, with a total of 5,025 rooms, Newsom said.
Yet among the most concerning issues is the increasing number of positive cases at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, Newsom said.
The California Department of Public Health released the number of coronavirus cases at the state’s skilled nursing facilities for the first time Saturday — and several Bay Area locations were prominent on the list.
Of the 1,224 skilled nursing facilities in California, 261 reported one or more coronavirus cases as of Friday.
Breakouts at three skilled nursing facilities in Tulare County, for example, “would break your heart when you learn more about them,” Newsom said.
