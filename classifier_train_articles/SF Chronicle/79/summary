But the mayor’s strategy for moving the homeless indoors kept changing, and the supervisors weren’t getting what they wanted.
As mayor, Breed has been the face of the city’s response, while Aragón has largely stayed out of the public eye.
While the board has mostly stepped aside, that has begun to shift as the crisis deepens and supervisors assert their independence.
At issue is how many hotel rooms the city should lease to house the city’s 8,000-plus homeless population, and frontline workers who need a place to quarantine.
When asked Wednesday if the supervisors’ plan was realistic, Breed swiftly answered: “No.”“We all want the same things,” she said.
