But Finney’s hero had a choice: The government had another secret mission in mind for San Francisco in 1901, and had a plan to use a location in Marin County to slip back into the early 20th century.
He was born in San Francisco, too, and I bet he had a lot of stories, but he died before I could hear too many.
And besides, I’m a 21st century San Franciscan, and a lot of the attitudes of 1901 would make me uncomfortable.
San Francisco used to be a great dining town, but by the fall, there were half as many restaurants as there had been a year ago.
