Chefs and restaurant owners across the country have voiced their frustration this week about the makeup of an economic council assembled by the White House to address the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on businesses.
A recent announcement by Yountville chef Thomas Keller that he was “proud” to be part of the group spurred outcry on social media, which led the chef to hit back at his “haters” online.
So when Keller said that he was “honored” to be tapped for the White House council on Twitter, he was immediately hit with blowback.
“The lack of women is really painful,” wrote Kat Kinsman, a senior editor at Food & Wine magazine, on Twitter.
In response to the backlash, Keller, who normally isn’t known for engaging in online back-and-forth, spoke up on Twitter.
