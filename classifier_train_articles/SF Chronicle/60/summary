To enforce the special hours, Albertsons is asking other customers to not infringe on the set-aside hours.
Canyon Market in San Francisco’s Glen Park neighborhood has announced seniors-only shopping hours from 7 to 8 a.m. daily.
Piedmont Grocery in Oakland will begin setting aside hours for customers older than 65 from 9 to 10 a.m. Sunday.
Seniors are at more risk being with younger people than with other seniors, assuming the other seniors aren’t sick already, Siegel added.
