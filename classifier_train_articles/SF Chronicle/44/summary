Yountville chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller has been tapped to serve on the food and beverage arm of President Trump’s newly announced Great American Economic Revival Industry Group.
In March, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 60% of the jobs lost that month were positions at restaurants and bars.
This announcement comes as the federal Small Business Administration closed applications for its small business relief program Thursday, with the nearly $350 billion in forgivable loans earmarked by the federal Cares Act already spoken for.
The Small Business Administration’s website includes this message: “The SBA is currently unable to accept new applications for the Paycheck Protection Program based on available appropriations funding.
Similarly, we are unable to enroll new PPP lenders at this time.”Soleil Ho is The San Francisco Chronicle’s restaurant critic.
