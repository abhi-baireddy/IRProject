Yountville chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller has been tapped to serve on the food and beverage arm of President Trump’s newly announced Great American Economic Revival Industry Group. The chef/owner of Michelin-starred The French Laundry, Ad Hoc, Bouchon Bakery and other restaurants around the country will work alongside fellow restaurateurs Daniel Boulud, Wolfgang Puck, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and the CEOs of major food corporations like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Chick-fil-A.

The group, which also includes the CEOs of the National Restaurant Association and International Franchise Association, will reportedly focus on addressing the needs of the food and beverage industry, with the ultimate goal of rebuilding the economy, hit hard by the fallout of the novel coronavirus. In March, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 60% of the jobs lost that month were positions at restaurants and bars.

In his announcement of the appointment via Twitter on Wednesday, Keller wrote, “Proud to work together towards a strategy where the safety of Americans is top of mind in conjunction towards economic revitalization.” Keller did not respond to a request for comment.

This announcement comes as the federal Small Business Administration closed applications for its small business relief program Thursday, with the nearly $350 billion in forgivable loans earmarked by the federal Cares Act already spoken for. The Small Business Administration’s website includes this message: “The SBA is currently unable to accept new applications for the Paycheck Protection Program based on available appropriations funding. Similarly, we are unable to enroll new PPP lenders at this time.”
