Gavin Newsom will consult with four ex-governors, recent Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, and dozens of other politicians and business leaders to guide California out of the “pandemic-induced recession” that has gripped the state.
Newsom said Friday that Ann O’Leary, his chief of staff, and Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist who ended his presidential campaign in February, would lead a task force on business and job recovery from the coronavirus crash.
“We want to make this meaningful,” Newsom said during a news conference.
While restarting the economy as fast as possible is a goal of the task force, Newsom said it would be guided first by health and safety considerations.
The recommendations of the task force also will aim to advance California’s environmental and racial equity goals.
