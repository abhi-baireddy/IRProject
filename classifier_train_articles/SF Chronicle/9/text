San Francisco Mayor London Breed has picked two high-profile attorneys to fill vacant slots on the Police Commission, a board that sets law enforcement policy for the city and conducts hearings for officers accused of misconduct.

The mayor’s nominees, former district attorney candidate Nancy Tung and business law attorney Geoffrey Gordon-Creed, would serve four-year terms in place of outgoing commissioners Robert Hirsch and Thomas Mazzucco, respectively.

Tung, a prosecutor in Alameda County since 2017, established herself as a tough-on-crime candidate in last year’s San Francisco district attorney contest, ultimately clinched by a progressive reformist, Chesa Boudin. Gordon-Creed, who works in private practice, represented police officers in his prior role as a deputy city attorney for San Francisco.

“Both are well-respected not only in the legal community, but also for their work within San Francisco,” Breed said of the two nominees, who have to be confirmed by the Board of Supervisors before joining the seven-member commission.

She added: “I am confident that Nancy and Geoffrey will help us build on the progress we have made to continue reforming our Police Department while ensuring that all of our communities are safe and well-represented.”
