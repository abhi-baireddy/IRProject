But fundraising isn’t everything in the campaigns, said Torunn Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee.
It’s much closer in the Central Valley rematch between former GOP Rep. David Valadao and Democratic Rep. TJ Cox of Fresno, who took Valadao’s seat in 2018.
The GOP challenger has $1.2 million in campaign cash, only about $1,700 more than Cox.
In another rematch of a 2018 race, Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros has $1.1 million cash on hand, compared with $970,420 for Republican Young Kim of Fullerton.
One of the most hotly contested California races is for a Los Angeles-area seat left open by last year’s resignation of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill.
