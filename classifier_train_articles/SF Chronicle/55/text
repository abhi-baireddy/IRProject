A man was struck by a northbound Caltrain in San Francisco late Friday and survived with unknown injuries, a spokesman said.

Northbound train 197 hit the man, identified only as a trespasser, at the Mission Bay Drive crossing just south of the main San Francisco Caltrain station at about 11:15 p.m., according to SamTrans spokesman Alex Eisenhart.

None of the eight passengers on the train was injured. Service was delayed for about 50 minutes.

The extent of injuries and circumstances of the collision were not known. The injured man was being treated at a nearby hospital, Eisenhart said.
