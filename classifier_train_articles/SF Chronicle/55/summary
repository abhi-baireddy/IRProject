A man was struck by a northbound Caltrain in San Francisco late Friday and survived with unknown injuries, a spokesman said.
Northbound train 197 hit the man, identified only as a trespasser, at the Mission Bay Drive crossing just south of the main San Francisco Caltrain station at about 11:15 p.m., according to SamTrans spokesman Alex Eisenhart.
None of the eight passengers on the train was injured.
The injured man was being treated at a nearby hospital, Eisenhart said.
