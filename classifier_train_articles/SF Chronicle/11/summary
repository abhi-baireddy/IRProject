A suspected thief swinging a bat at police inside a San Leandro Walmart store was shot dead Saturday afternoon by one of the officers, officials said.
Officers were called to the store around 3 p.m. to investigate reports of a man trying to steal something, San Leandro Police Lt. Ted Henderson said at press briefing outside the store.
When they approached, the man he grabbed a nearby bat and allegedly threatened the officers.
One of the officers, a 20-year police veteran, then fired a shot and fatally struck the man in the upper torso, Henderson said.
The store, which sits on busy Hesperian Boulevard in the south part of town, was evacuated during the confrontation and quickly closed.
