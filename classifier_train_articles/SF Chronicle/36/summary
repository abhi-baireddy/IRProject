Three Twins ice cream, the Petaluma company that carved out a market for mass-market organic ice cream, is ceasing operations because of financial problems related to the coronavirus.
In posts on Facebook and the company website Friday, Three Twins CEO Neal Gottlieb announced that the company would cease operations immediately.
The reason, he stated, was that the business had required an infusion of capital even before the pandemic and that option was no longer available.
An expansion of sales into grocery stores, where profit margins are often low for suppliers, was a particular challenge.
The company had licenses with additional scoop shops at San Francisco International Airport and Berkeley as well as in Korea and Japan, and its ice cream was sold at major grocery stores in the Bay Area.
