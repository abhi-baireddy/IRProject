There is another springtime ritual that is unique to San Francisco, and that is the annual commemoration of the great earthquake that nearly destroyed San Francisco on April 18, 1906.
But, in a sense, the city itself is a survivor of that great disaster, and the ceremony at Lottaâ€™s Fountain went on.
There were not many black people in San Francisco in 1906, but they had a presence.
Only a few years earlier San Francisco had seen an outbreak of bubonic plague, spread mostly by rats.
Richard Torney, a Marin historian, likes to remind people about his great great grandfather, especially around the earthquake anniversary.
