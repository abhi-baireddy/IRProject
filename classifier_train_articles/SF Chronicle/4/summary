Yes, everyone is staying home right now, but people with any symptoms should be especially cautious.
Symptoms of COVID-19 — the illness caused by the new coronavirus — can be difficult if not impossible to distinguish from influenza, or even a really bad cold or allergies.
The main symptoms are fever and cough, and shortness of breath as the illness progresses.
That said, there have been cases of COVID-19 where patients had all of those symptoms.
Also, anyone who has recently traveled overseas, especially to areas with known coronavirus outbreaks, or who has been in contact with someone diagnosed with the virus should immediately contact a health care provider if they have symptoms.
