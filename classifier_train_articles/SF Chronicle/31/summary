Top health officials in the Bay Area and nearby counties are working on plans to relax shelter-in-place orders next month for 7 million people stretching from Napa to Monterey, but the new order would probably apply only to outdoor activities, officials said Wednesday.
The plan, being hashed out by the Association of Bay Area Health Officers, an organization of county and city health directors, is to loosen restrictions on May 4 on lower-risk activities in 13 jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose.
“We are working together as a region on the next shelter-in-place order,” said Gail Newel, the health officer for Santa Cruz County.
The order, which was quickly expanded, was the first in the nation and helped inspire Gov.
There are glimmers of hope, but however long this lasts, we are going to need the public’s help and understanding, because we might have to reverse some of our decisions.”Peter Fimrite is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
