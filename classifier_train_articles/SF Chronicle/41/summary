The famous blues musician is a longtime friend of Simmons’, who co-owns the 52-year-old bar Specs’ Twelve Adler Museum Cafe, better known as Specs’, in San Francisco’s North Beach.
“He loves City Lights, and he’d always come to our bar afterward.” He understands the uniquely quirky charm of Specs’, named for its founder Richard “Specs” Simmons (Elly Simmons’ father): Its wall-to-wall exhibits of tchotchkes.
Countless Bay Area bars have launched fundraisers since shelter-in-place orders began, including many in North Beach like Vesuvio, Gino & Carlo and Comstock Saloon.
(One longtime North Beach bar and restaurant, Tosca Cafe, surprisingly reopened under new ownership during shelter in place, for takeout only.)
“The government response is so anemic,” says Janet Clyde, co-owner of the 72-year-old bar Vesuvio, which has a GoFundMe page to raise money for its employees’ living expenses.
