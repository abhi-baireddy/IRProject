The coronavirus pandemic has blown a multibillion-dollar hole in California’s budget, one that is likely to force Gov.
The shortfall is likely to total roughly $35 billion in 2020-21 alone, the nonpartisan state legislative analyst told senators who convened a special budget hearing on the coronavirus Thursday in Sacramento.
“If budget problems of this magnitude were to emerge, they would exceed the state’s reserves,” Petek said, in something of an understatement.
Jerry Brown accumulated over the past decade totals about $21 billion, about $4 billion of which will probably be needed this year to meet the constitutional requirement of a balanced state budget.
He suggested lawmakers pass a “baseline budget” that doesn’t add nonmandatory expenses and assumes the state continues existing service levels.
