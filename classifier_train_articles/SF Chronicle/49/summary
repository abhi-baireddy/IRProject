One Medical, a primary care provider based in San Francisco, has begun offering coronavirus testing for people without symptoms, becoming what experts say is one of the first medical providers to expand diagnostic testing beyond those who are sick.
The company has a major presence in the Bay Area, with 32 medical offices in the region.
Testing for the coronavirus is done at some but not all locations, and tests are by appointment only, though patients must first undergo a virtual assessment by One Medical.
