Coronavirus: How you can help Bay Area’s most vulnerable

With the coronavirus shelter-in-place order in effect in the Bay Area, readers are asking how they can help. Many nonprofits, community groups, charities, food banks and other organizations are anticipating a strain on their resources and requesting financial donations to help them continue to provide services while other organizations still need healthy volunteers.

Here are organizations, by category, that need your donations and volunteer time. The Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund is also taking donations: 100% of the money raised goes directly to help the families and communities served.
