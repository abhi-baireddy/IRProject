“Those sequences belong in the same cluster as the infection in Washington state,” Chiu said.
“All of them were mapped to the Washington state strain,” known to scientists as the WA1 strain, Chiu said.
“I’m now investigating a cluster in Santa Clara,” in which four people in a single building tested positive, Chiu said.
During the past week, the Washington strain has spread into California counties, he said.
“It concerns me that the Washington strain appears to be infiltrating California,” he said.
