Coronavirus: How long does it stay on surfaces? And in...

We know the coronavirus primarily spreads through person-to-person contact when an infected person coughs or sneezes. But live particles that cause COVID-19 can survive on some surfaces for days or weeks, and remain in the air for hours.

That’s cause for concern.

“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While the lifespan of the virus on surfaces varies depending on the material, here are some basic guidelines to staying safe during the coronavirus pandemic:

Q: How long does the coronavirus survive on surfaces? In the air?

A: The virus can linger as droplets in the air for up to three hours, according to the New England Journal of Medicine; and it can travel at least 13 feet by aerosols that are emitted by breathing or speaking — twice as far as established phsycial distancing guidelines, based on a report by the CDC.

Here's a rundown to how long coronaviruses can live on some common surfaces, as stated in their findings, as well as a more recent study by the medical journal The Lancet.

• Aluminum: 2-8 hours

• Paper: 3 hours

• Copper: 4 hours

• Cardboard: 24 hours

• Cloth: 2 days

• Wood: 2-4 days

• Plastic: 3-6 days

• Stainless steel: 3-6 days

• Glass: 4 days

• Paper money: 4 days

• Metal: 5 days

• Surgical mask (exterior): 7 days

Traces of the virus were additionally found in the cabins of infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 days after they left the cabins. The rooms that were tested had not been disinfected, the CDC said.

There is not enough clear evidence yet to suggest how the virus behaves under different conditions, such as exposure to direct sunlight, extreme heat or cold.

Q: Why are infected surfaces dangerous?

A: It may be possible that a person can get the coronavirus by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes, according to the CDC.

Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after touching surfaces that anyone else might have touched. The organization adds it doesn’t make a difference whether you use cold or hot water, as "temperature does not appear to affect microbe removal."

Q: How should you keep surfaces clean during the outbreak?

A: Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces using soap and water, including tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.

A list of cleaning products that are most effective against the coronavirus can be found on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website. The American Chemistry Council also has a list of commercial products that are effective in fighting pathogens.

Q: What about food and groceries?

A: There is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated or frozen temperatures, according to the CDC.

There is currently no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food. A detailed FAQ on food safety is available here.

All produce should be soaked in warm water before consumption, including vegetables and fruits that you peel (such as bananas). Avoid using chemicals like bleach or rubbing alcohol directly on food you’re going to consume but you should either dispose of or sanitize any packaging, especially areas that were most likely handled by other people. You should also wash canned goods, plastic or glass containers with warm water and soap before handling.

Always wash your hands before preparing or eating food. In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces.

Q: Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?

A: Yes. There is no evidence to support transmission of the coronavirus associated with imported goods because of poor survivability of the coronavirus on surfaces over time, based on the CDC’s findings.

It is not necessary to disinfect packages, but if possible open them and dispose of packaging outside your home. And sanitize your hands after handling them.

Q: Can the virus travel on your shoes?

A: Yes. Samples taken from the soles of the medical staff working in intensive care units at a hospital in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak started, tested positive for coronavirus on the soles of their shoes.

“Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers,” according to the study, which was published in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.

Outside a hospital setting, the CDC does not offer advice on handling footwear but some good general guidelines to follow are to leave your shoes at the door when entering your home, minimize handling them and be sure to thoroughly wash your hands and disinfect any surfaces they come into contact with after touching them.

If your shoes are machine washable, follow the laundry guidelines below to sanitize them.

Q: How should you clean surfaces on electronics?

A: To clean electronic devices such as phones, tablets, remote controls and keyboards, the CDC recommends following manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfecting. If no guidance is available, use alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol, and dry surfaces thoroughly.

Q: How do you treat surfaces if someone in your home is sick?

A: There are several recommended steps to take if someone in your home is sick with with COVID-19:

• Close off areas used by the sick person.

• Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect surfaces.

• Clean surfaces using soap and water.

• Disinfect using one of the following methods: diluted household bleach solutions if appropriate for the surface; alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol; household cleaners and disinfectants. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.

• For soft surfaces such as carpeted floors, rugs and drapes, clean using soap and water or launder.

Q: What about laundry?

A: When handling clothing, towels, linens and other items in an area where infection is suspected, the CDC recommends wearing disposable gloves. Do not shake dirty laundry. Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely before handling. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance, listed above, for surfaces.

Wash your hands thoroughly after handling dirty laundry.
