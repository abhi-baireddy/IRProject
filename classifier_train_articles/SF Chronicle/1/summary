Despite the omnipresent threat of the coronavirus and firm orders from San Francisco Mayor London Breed to stop all gatherings, firefighters and history buffs were determined to commemorate the 114th anniversary of the 1906 earthquake.
The tremors of 1906 ripped gas mains throughout the city, causing flames to lash through its neighborhoods.
Traditionally, dozens of people come out each year to remember the earthquake and fire that nearly destroyed the city.
Houskeeper cited a quote from Chronicle columnist Carl Nolte — that San Francisco “is the real survivor” of the 1906 disasters.
