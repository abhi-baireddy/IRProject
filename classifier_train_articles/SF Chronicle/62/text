Two computer programs that can predict whether, and when, doctors and hospitals will be flooded with COVID-19 patients have been created at Stanford University.

The programs, designed in weeks by computer engineers, use demographic information to predict when a given county will see surges in infected persons and when a given hospital will run out of hospital beds and supplies.

Engineering professor Peter Glynn said existing computer models were inadequate to address the COVID-19 crisis and that the Stanford programs have been made available to any hospital or health official that wants it.

Analyzing data about the age, health and preexisting medical conditions of a county’s population, the first program can predict infection rates for individual counties even without infection test results.

And the second program can tell hospitals when they are likely to run low on space, supplies and staff.

Another feature of the programs, already being used at two Stanford hospitals, makes predictions about upcoming needs for such supplies as face masks and gloves.

Three Stanford professors and about a dozen graduate students, all working remotely, developed the programs by teleconference. The group that developed the programs, known as Systems Utilization for Stanford Medicine, has also produced computer tools to help hospitals make more efficient use of operating rooms and surgical staffs.

The computer programs, Glynn said, “really gave the sense of how quickly the COVID-19 cases could impact a hospital. When you run the numbers in the model, you see how fast things can change.”
