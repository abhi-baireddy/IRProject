Two computer programs that can predict whether, and when, doctors and hospitals will be flooded with COVID-19 patients have been created at Stanford University.
Engineering professor Peter Glynn said existing computer models were inadequate to address the COVID-19 crisis and that the Stanford programs have been made available to any hospital or health official that wants it.
And the second program can tell hospitals when they are likely to run low on space, supplies and staff.
Another feature of the programs, already being used at two Stanford hospitals, makes predictions about upcoming needs for such supplies as face masks and gloves.
The computer programs, Glynn said, â€œreally gave the sense of how quickly the COVID-19 cases could impact a hospital.
