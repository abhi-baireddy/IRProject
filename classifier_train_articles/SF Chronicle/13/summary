The opening day for the sport salmon season, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, has been tentatively set for May 1 for the Bay Area and Monterey Bay coasts.
“You go salmon fishing and get a big salmon, who’s going to net it?” Mattusch said.
It’s likely Bonham wouldn’t act to open salmon fishing without approval from the governor’s office, according to a source close to the situation.
State and federal scientists forecast 473,200 adult salmon off the Bay Area coast.
The PFMC set the season to run through Nov. 8 on the Bay Area coast and through Oct. 4 in Monterey Bay.
