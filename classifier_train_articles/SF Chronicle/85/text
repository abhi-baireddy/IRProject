California Republicans hold four of the seven places on a GOP list of candidates across the country who are in strongly competitive races against House Democrats and deserve national fundraising support.

Orange County Republicans Young Kim and Michelle Steel, along with Mike Garcia of Santa Clarita (Los Angeles County) and David Valadao of Hanford (Kings County), are part of the first 2020 group of “Young Guns,” a program by the National Republican Congressional Committee to focus attention —and outside money — on candidates with a shot at taking Democratic House seats.

“These candidates are running extraordinarily competitive, top-of-the-line campaign operations,” Bakersfield Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, said in a statement. “Their hard work has put the (House) majority well within our reach.”

The GOP program is designed to identify its most competitive candidates and provide them with support. That early focus on the California candidates shows just how important the state races are to Republican hopes to take back the House.

All four candidates are seeking seats that Democrats grabbed from the GOP two years ago. For Valadao, who faces Fresno Rep. TJ Cox, and Kim, who is challenging Rep. Gil Cisneros, the November election will be a rematch of 2018.

While part of the GOP program is designed to help candidates making an early move into congressional politics, that really doesn’t apply to Valadao, who can use the support, but probably not the mentoring. He’s looking to win back a seat he held for six years.
