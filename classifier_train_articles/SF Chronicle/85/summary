California Republicans hold four of the seven places on a GOP list of candidates across the country who are in strongly competitive races against House Democrats and deserve national fundraising support.
“These candidates are running extraordinarily competitive, top-of-the-line campaign operations,” Bakersfield Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, said in a statement.
“Their hard work has put the (House) majority well within our reach.”The GOP program is designed to identify its most competitive candidates and provide them with support.
That early focus on the California candidates shows just how important the state races are to Republican hopes to take back the House.
All four candidates are seeking seats that Democrats grabbed from the GOP two years ago.
