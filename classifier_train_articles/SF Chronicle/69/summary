“People who are infected are shedding large amounts of virus, baseball players are touching their faces constantly, they’re constantly spitting.
You’re going to get tagged, you’re going to breathe, you’re going to get up.
“I think baseball does a good job — every hotel we go to, every clubhouse, is really clean,” Bassitt said.
“I think this ordeal will definitely make players think twice, create a whole different perspective on that,” Melvin said.
