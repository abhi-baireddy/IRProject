A one-year-old child in Oakley was transported to the hospital with second degree burns after hot tea spilled on the child’s arms Friday night, fire officials said.

The spill appeared to be an accident, but because of the child’s age first responders “treated it seriously,” said Steve Aubert, spokesman for the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.

The child was airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center in stable condition.
