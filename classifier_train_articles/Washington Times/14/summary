President Trump on Saturday said some governors have gotten carried away with the lockdown orders they’ve signed off on in response to the coronavirus outbreak, as some states try to chart a path forward toward reopening parts of their economy next month.
“I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away,” Mr. Trump said at the White House.
“That’s not even politics — we’re entitled to a Second Amendment,” Mr. Trump said.
“To me, that’s liberty — when I say liberate Virginia, I would say liberate Virginia when that kind of thing happens,” he said.
The president on Friday had tweeted that Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia should “liberate” amid various stay-at-home orders.
