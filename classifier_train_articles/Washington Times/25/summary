Federal agents nabbed a Mexican man just before he was to fly back home this week, and charged him with smuggling drugs through a 2,000-foot cross-border tunnel discovered last month running between Tijuana and San Diego.
The bust of the tunnel made headlines, and Thursdayâ€™s arrest gives prosecutors a scalp to go along with shutting down the smuggling route.
Rogelio Flores Guzman was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport as he was boarding a plane to Guadalajara.
Mr. Flores Guzman was released at that time, but agents picked him up again just before he tried to board the plane.
When agents busted the tunnel, they found 575 packages of drugs with a street value estimated at nearly $30 million.
