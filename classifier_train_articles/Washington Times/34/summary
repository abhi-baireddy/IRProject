Plans to commemorate the 75th anniversary of a slew of world-shaping events have become collateral damage in the effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commemorations for Iwo Jima and the taking of Okinawa already have been called off.
For some, the 75th anniversary events would have been their last opportunities to see their old comrades.
About 70,000 U.S. Marines and 18,000 Japanese soldiers were pitted against each other on Iwo Jima.
According to the National World War II Museum, the government awarded 27 Medals of Honor for actions there.
