Stephen A. Moore, a member of President Trump’s council to reopen the U.S. economy, likened demonstrators protesting coronavirus mitigation efforts to civil rights icon Rosa Parks.
“I think there’s a boiling point that has been reached and exceeded,” said Mr. Moore, The Washington Post reported.
We need to be the Rosa Parks here and protest against these government injustices,” Mr. Moore said on the Freedom on Tap show.
More recently, Mr. Trump sympathized with protesters rallying against the mitigation efforts during a White House press briefing Friday evening.
They all wanna open – nobody wants to stay shut, but they wanna open safely,” Mr. Trump added.
