NEW YORK - Sabrina Ionescu was the No.
1 pick in the WNBA draft Friday night, going to the New York Liberty in an Oregon sweep of the top two picks.
The Princeton star was only the second Ivy League player to be drafted that high.
It was a WNBA draft like no other because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I think it was a very beautiful thing the WNBA did to be able to draft those three girls,” Ionescu said.
