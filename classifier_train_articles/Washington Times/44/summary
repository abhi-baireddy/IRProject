The arsonists had managed to latch onto one of the more bizarre conspiracy theories about how and why the world is fighting a pandemic they don’t understand and just want to go away.
Although the attacks on the British cell towers was fueled by multiple tweets from people as goofy as U.S. actor Woody Harrelson and a British rap artist, others have been promulgated by people one would assume should be more level-headed.
Some fundamentalist Christian leaders have claimed the pandemic may be God’s way of letting mankind know that we have been misbehaving.
In the process, they too are coming up with theories as to where the virus actually originated and why.
But it would be safe to lay odds that cell towers and climate change are going to escape blame.
