NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) â€” A Tennessee mayor is reversing course to allow drive-in church services during the coronavirus pandemic after the city was sued over its ban.
The conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom recently filed a federal lawsuit over the drive-in church ban on behalf of Chattanooga-based Metropolitan Tabernacle Church.
More than 400 inmates at Bledsoe County Correctional Complex are scheduled to be tested for COVID-19 after 12 inmates there tested positive.
At least seven other inmates across the state prison system have tested positive, according to the state corrections department.
The widespread testing came in reaction to six workers previously testing positive at the facilities.
