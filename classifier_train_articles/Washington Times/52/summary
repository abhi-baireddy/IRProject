The federal government will start buying meat, vegetables and milk from the nation’s farmers and distribute the surplus to the nation’s food banks, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Thursday, a plan welcomed by the agricultural sector.
While the details and the amount of money that will be spent on the program were not clear, Mr. Perdue said President Trump has approved the plan to help the nation’s farmers during the coronavirus outbreak.
“Yes — that’s directly we’ll take dairy products,” Mr. Perdue said.
“We’ll take meat, protein products, both beef and pork off the their produce as well.
“We do have an adequate supply — we just have to make sure the supply gets connected with the demand.”Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage NewslettersCopyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.
