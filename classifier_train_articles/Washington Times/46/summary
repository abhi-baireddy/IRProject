The Steele Dossier — key evidence the FBI used to justify spying on a Trump campaign figure in 2016 — was based in part on Russian disinformation, two top senators revealed, citing newly declassified footnotes from an inspector general’s report.
“These footnotes confirm that there was a direct Russian disinformation campaign in 2016, and there were ties between Russian intelligence and a presidential campaign — the Clinton campaign, not Trump’s,” Mr. Grassley and Mr. Johnson said.
Mr. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which was being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to gather dirt on Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump, enraged by the FBI investigation, would fire then-Director James Comey in spring 2017, spurring the Justice Department to name a special counsel to investigate.
Robert Mueller’s team found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but did ding Mr. Trump for trying to interfere with the probe.
