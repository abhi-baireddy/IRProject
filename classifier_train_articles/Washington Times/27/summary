Cook County, home of Chicago, released hundreds of inmates from its jails during the coronavirus crisis.
The Cook County Sheriff’s Office that runs the jail says it doesn’t know who was released because of the coronavirus.
Even the Chicago Police Department says it’s in the dark about inmates who have been released.
“The greatest fear people have is the fear of the unknown,” Kevin Graham, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, told The Washington Times.
‘A right to be concerned’Roughly 1,000 detainees have been released from the Cook County Jail over the past month, although not only because of the coronavirus.
