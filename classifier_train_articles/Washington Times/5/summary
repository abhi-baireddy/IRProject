The FBI learned in February 2017 that Russian intelligence managed to infiltrate a source into the network of informants Mr. Steele used.
Indeed, Russian intelligence was aware of Mr. Steele’s anti-Trump efforts as far back as early July 2016, even before the FBI opened its investigation, the inspector general’s report says.
That Russian disinformation found its way into Mr. Steele’s work had long been suspected, but the declassified information from Mr. Horowitz’s report is the first official confirmation.
The information released Wednesday comes from still more declassified information from the footnotes of Mr. Horowitz’s report.
Based on the new information from Mr. Horowitz, it now appears that it was the Clinton campaign that injected Russian disinformation into American politics.
