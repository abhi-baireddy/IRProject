Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin properly followed department protocols when he refused to turn over President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, the Treasury Department’s Inspector General’s Office said Friday.
Mr. Delmar said that Mr. Mnuchin’s actions correctly followed an opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.
In April 2019, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, Massachusetts Democrat, demanded the IRS turn over six years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns.
The Treasury and IRS rebuffed the request as well as repeated subpoenas sent by Mr. Neal.
Mr. Neal responded by filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration last year.
