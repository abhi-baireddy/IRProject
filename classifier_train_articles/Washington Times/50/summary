One America News lashed out Friday at the White House Correspondents Association in light of the right-wing cable network falling out of favor among President Trump’s press corps.
Days since being stripped of its seat in the White House briefing room, the blatantly pro-Trump outlet fired back in a video touted by OAN’s founder and chief executive officer.
“The White House Correspondents Association is holding free speech hostage,” OAN CEO Robert Herring said on Twitter where he shared the video from his personal account.
OAN’s White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, repeatedly defied that policy before the board voted to remove the outlet from rotation and has continued to do so in the days since.
Ms. Rion has continued to attend White House press room briefings despite losing her seat, which Mr. Sharp attributed to being personally invited by the president’s press office.
