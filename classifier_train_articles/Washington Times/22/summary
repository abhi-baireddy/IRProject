Twitter on Thursday permanently suspended multiple social media accounts associated with Infowars, the controversial outlet helmed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
More recently, Infowars and Mr. Jones have come under fire over their response to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people worldwide.
New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a cease-and-desist order to Mr. Jones last month after he falsely claimed that products sold through Infowars can treat the virus.
Mr. Shroyer has since announced he will be hosting a “You Can’t Close America” rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin this Saturday in defiance of the state’s stay-at-home order.
Mr. Jones subsequently claimed during his program Friday that Twitter suspended accounts including Mr. Shroyer’s because they had promoted the protest.
