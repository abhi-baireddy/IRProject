The 57-year-old mayor brushed off the backlash Monday, saying the people of Chicago are more concerned with the public health crisis than her haircut.
“This is a public health matter and leadership comes from the top.
The fact that she’s saying one thing and doing another, I just think it’s really despicable, in fact.
I was really, really surprised at this from the mayor of Chicago.
Really, really disappointed.”Co-hosts Joy Behar and Meghan McCain agreed.
