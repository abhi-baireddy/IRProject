President Trump on Saturday hinted that he’s looking at unspecified “consequences” for China if it’s proven that the country was knowingly responsible for the global spread of the coronavirus.
“If they were knowingly responsible, certainly.
But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences,” Mr. Trump said at the White House.
Mr. Trump had said in January that China was working “very hard” to contain the coronavirus.
In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!” Mr. Trump tweeted on Jan. 24.
