“The president calls me once a week just to see how I’m doing,” Mr. Limbaugh said while hosting the latest episode of his syndicated radio program.
Mr. Limbaugh, 69, announced in early February that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and would be broadcasting less frequently while undergoing treatment.
“And how do we know they’re even health experts?” Mr. Limbaugh asked during an episode of his radio program late last month.
“I can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these people and we’ve done very well,” Mr. Trump answered.
I’m never saying bad about these people.”The White House did not immediately return a message over the weekend inquiring about the president’s conversations with Mr. Limbaugh.
