President Trump singled out Virginia’s latest gun-control measure as an example of Democratic governors doing “too much” with their authority during the coronavirus pandemic.
“I think elements of what they’ve done is too much,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the governors of Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota.
Mr. Northam has issued a stay-at-home order until June 10.
The president tweeted earlier Friday that Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia should “liberate,” after conservatives protested stay-at-home orders.
Jay Inslee’s criticism that Mr. Trump was fomenting “rebellion,” the president disagreed and said the crisis was “too tough” for some leaders such as Mr. Inslee, another Democrat.
