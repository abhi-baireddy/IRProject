Actress Patricia Heaton questioned Wednesday why any “civilized person” would support the Democratic Party given its “barbaric” stance on abortion.
“I don’t understand why pro-life people want to know if they are ‘welcome’ to join the Democrat party,” Ms. Heaton tweeted to her 427,000 followers.
“Why would any civilized person want to support a barbaric platform that champions abortion for any reason through all nine months funded by taxpayers?”Ms. Heaton, an outspoken conservative, said she walked away from the Democratic Party decades ago because of her pro-life views.
I don’t like Trump but I don’t have an apocalyptic view of him.”Democrats appear to be at odds at whether it’s still acceptable to be a pro-life Democrat.
“I support the position of my party,” the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, responded.
