Dr. Anthony Fauci says that human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 diseases erupted in China in mid-December, yet the communist regime told the U.S. and the world that the virus was only transmitted animal-to-human.
“Early on we did not get correct information, and the incorrect information was propagated right from the beginning,” Dr. Fauci said.
Republicans have accused the Chinese Communist Party, the dictatorship ruling the country, of deliberately concealing the virus’ spread.
The White House says that while China was hiding disease facts, it was also buying up lots of medical equipment around the world.
Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had himself relied on the Chinese disinformation to downplay COVID-19’s threat to America.
