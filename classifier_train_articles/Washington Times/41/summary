Celebrity psychologist Phil McGraw is facing a wave of criticism after he claimed on Fox News that the statewide shutdowns due to the coronavirus are more deadly than the virus itself.
Mr. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, appeared on “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday to discuss how anxiety and depression are affecting Americans as they isolate themselves in their homes.
“The fallout is going to last for years because people’s lives are being destroyed,” he said.

If 4% of people who routinely went swimming would die & 15% would end up in the hospital, I guarantee Dr. Phil would not go swimming.
