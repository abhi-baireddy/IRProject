ANALYSIS/OPINION:The biggest threat to the United States today is not a virus, but rather “virus-shaming.” The greatest challenge the American experiment faces in this dark hour is not our need for safety but our loss of liberty.
If anything is clear in the history of civilization, as well as that of the church, it is this: When you sacrifice human freedom for the sake of human safety, you almost always diminish the human being.
As the old axiom goes, “A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are for,” and so it is with human beings.
Michael Ramsden (from the Oxford Center for Christian Apologetics) recently argued that the greatest threat to human beings in the 21st century could, in fact, be a misguided concept of human safety.
At the end of the day, we must decide if liberty is an assumed predicate to the definition of what it means to be human.
