President Trump said Friday that he is hopeful about returning to the campaign trail and holding “bigger than ever rallies” in spite of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic.
It’s great for a lot of things,” Mr. Trump said during a White House press briefing.
“I think they’re going to be bigger than ever,” Mr. Trump continued, adding: “I hope we can resume rallies because I think they’re an important part of politics.”Mr. Trump made the comments after a member of his reelection team was reported earlier Friday to have indicated that the president is optimistic about holding campaign rallies before the White House race ends November 3.
“This coronavirus will pass and the president is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail and holding rallies,” said Tim Murtaugh, a communications director for the Trump campaign, ABC News reported.
Public health officials, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, have advised that Americans avoid large gatherings to prevent the pandemic from worsening.
