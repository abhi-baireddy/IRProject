The Defense Department inspector general found no evidence of White House interference in the contract award process.
The contract, potentially worth $10 billion, was awarded to Microsoft last October, prompting tech rival Amazon to cry foul.
The review also sought to determine whether the White House influenced the Pentagon’s decision, as Amazon has alleged.
The report said that although it appears there was no such White House pressure, the reviewers could not definitely determine the full extent of White House interactions with the Pentagon’s decision makers.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Robert Carver, said the inspector general’s report shows that the contract award process was fair and legal.
