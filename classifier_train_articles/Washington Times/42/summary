Michael Avenatti, a convicted lawyer who gained fame taking on President Trump, was granted a reprieve Friday by a federal court judge who approved his temporary release from jail.
U.S. District Judge James V. Selna agreed to free Avenatti for 90 days after a lawyer for the disgraced celebrity attorney argued he was at high risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.
Under the judgeâ€™s order issued late Friday, Avenatti will be freed for 90 days on a $1 million bond.
Marshals once the 90 days are over, the judge ruled.
Avenatti was later charged last May in Manhattan with allegedly defrauding Ms. Clifford out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
