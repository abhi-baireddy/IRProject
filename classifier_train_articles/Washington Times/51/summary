A media research group on Friday released the transcript of a China-produced Arabic-language news report to show how Beijing’s propaganda machine is blaming the coronavirus on America.
“China View’s” unfounded, and inaccurate reports, are repeated by Chinese propagandists on social media, including Twitter, reaching millions, analysts say.
As for the U.S. military planting or transferring the virus while at the Military World Games in Wuhan in October, the World Health Organization (WHO) told The Washington Times there is no evidence.
Mr. Boxwell points out that conspiracies promoted by China’s Arabic TV are repeated by various Chinese media accounts on Twitter and other platforms, gaining millions of views.
Chinese media enjoy free run of the U.S., including on Twitter,” he wrote.
