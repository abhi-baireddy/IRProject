"When [Republican governor Brad Little] signed a law to ban trans athletes, he sent a message that trans people do not deserve the benefits of sports available to their peers," ACLU of Idaho wrote on Twitter.
When @GovernorLittle signed a law to ban trans athletes, he sent a message that trans people do not deserve the benefits of sports available to their peers.
"Inclusive teams support all athletes and encourage participation, this should be the standard for all school sports."
Little said his decision to pass the law was to protect the rights of female athletes.
Female students in Connecticut filed federal lawsuits seeking to prevent schools in the state from allowing transgender people to compete in women's sports after the students lost competitions to athletes born male.
