Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I., Vt.) endorsement of former vice president Joe Biden marks the second straight election in which the Vermont senator took on the Democratic establishment before throwing his support behind the establishment candidate.
Sanders repeatedly boasted during the 2020 primary that his campaign was "taking on the Democratic establishment."
He declared Biden's candidacy the "same old, same old establishment politics" and said the establishment was "freaking out" over his early success in the primaries.
Sanders officially capitulated on Monday after Biden gained an insurmountable lead in the primary fight.
He told his supporters to back Biden, whom he has attacked for voting for the Iraq war, having ties to Wall Street, opposing Medicare for All, supporting free trade agreements, and their differences on entitlements.
