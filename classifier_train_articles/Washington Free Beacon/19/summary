The United States Congress, under the bold leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.)—aka "Midnight Mitch," "Cocaine Mitch," "Moscow Mitch," etc.—has achieved its highest approval rating in more than a decade, according to a Gallup survey published this week.
A solid 30 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing on McConnell's watch.
According to Gallup, the last time Congress had an approval rating this high was September 2009.
The current figure might be even higher if not for the fact that Congress has two chambers.
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives—the lower, angrier chamber—has been flailing haphazardly under the so-called leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), who recently celebrated her 80th birthday.
