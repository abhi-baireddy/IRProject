The federal program backstopping small businesses during the coronavirus crisis is set to run out of funds Wednesday evening, thanks in part to a Senate stalemate over refilling its coffers.
That, Small Business Committee chairman Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) wrote Wednesday, will leave 700,000 small business applications in "limbo."
Now 700000 small business applications are in limbo & no new loans will be made until the game of chicken in Congress ends & additional $ approved.
Now, that legislative stalemate leaves many small businesses floundering without a lifeline.
The PPP works by guaranteeing loans to small businesses which can be forgiven if the loans are spent on payrolls.
