The New York Times edited a controversial passage in an article about a sexual assault allegation against former vice president Joe Biden after his campaign complained, the paper's executive editor said Monday.
Baquet failed to muster a coherent response beyond noting that the standard for reporting on such allegations is "very subjective."
Kavanaugh vehemently denied Ford's allegation, and the Times did not interview anyone who recalled Ford telling them about the alleged incident at the time.
Baquet, in the interview with Smith, cited the importance of "contemporaneous" conversations in determining the credibility and newsworthiness of sexual assault allegations.
Swetnick, a client of former attorney and convicted felon Michael Avenatti, accused Kavanaugh of gang rape at frat parties.
