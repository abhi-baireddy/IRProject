Idaho governor Brad Little (R.) on Monday signed the Fairness in Women's Sports Act to prohibit biologically male students from participating in all-female sports.
"Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex," the bill states.
The law cites differences in male and female physiology that results in distinct athletic capabilities.
Chelsea Mitchell, one of the athletes challenging the state of Connecticut, said she was happy about Idaho's new legislation.
I have watched this happen over and over again in my sport in Connecticut, as so many girls have been impacted."
