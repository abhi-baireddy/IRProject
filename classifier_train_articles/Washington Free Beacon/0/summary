By Idrees AliWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Eleven vessels from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) came dangerously close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, the U.S. military said on Wednesday, calling the moves "dangerous and provocative."
According to the statement, the Iranian vessels approached six U.S. military ships while they were conducting integration operations with Army helicopters in international waters.
At one point, the Iranian vessels came within 10 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui.
The Iranian ships left after about an hour, the statement added.
The sources said the SC Taipei chemical tanker had been sailing in international waters on Tuesday when it was stopped.
