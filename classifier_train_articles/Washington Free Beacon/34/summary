A collection of Second Amendment activists filed a pair of federal lawsuits on Friday targeting sheriffs in California and North Carolina over mandatory coronavirus-related shutdowns of gun stores and permit-purchase systems, respectively.
A separate suit was filed in North Carolina after Wake County sheriff Gerald Baker (D.) refused to process new pistol-purchase and gun-carry permits starting on Tuesday.
SAF founder Alan Gottlieb called the shutdowns in Los Angeles County an "attack on fundamental rights."
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told the Washington Free Beacon it "has not been served with this lawsuit and has no comment at this time."
Local officials have argued that gun stores are not "essential" and are thus subject to a statewide lockdown.
