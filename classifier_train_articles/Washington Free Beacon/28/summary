Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on Sunday accused President Donald Trump of costing American lives through his response to the spread of the coronavirus.
"Are you saying [Trump's] downplaying ultimately cost American lives?"
I'm saying that," Pelosi said.
Former vice president Joe Biden, also a critic of Trump's coronavirus response, said during an interview on Sunday's Meet the Press that it would be a stretch to blame Trump for lives lost due to the virus.
During his campaign for president, Biden has said Trump should be held accountable for "failures" in the virus response, although he has also denied that he is trying to criticize the president.
