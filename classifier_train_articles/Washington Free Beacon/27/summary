Joe Biden has been asked 81 questions in over two hours worth of media interviews since a former staffer in his U.S. Senate office accused him of sexual assault three weeks ago.
Democrats have made clear that the the sexual assault allegation against Biden will not affect their willingness to rally around him.
In the weeks since Reade's allegation, Biden has cemented his status as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and secured the endorsements of his fiercest primary opponents and former president Barack Obama.
The New York Times did not, however, report that there was no corroboration.
Though his campaign has flatly denied Reade's allegation, Biden himself argued less than two years ago during the 2018 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced an accusation of sexual assault that nearly derailed his nomination, that you should believe all claims of sexual assault, especially in high-profile situations.
