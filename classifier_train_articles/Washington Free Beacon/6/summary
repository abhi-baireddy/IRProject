Marcotte's interview included a number of false claims about Reade—who filed a police report Thursday—sparking pushback from fellow progressive journalist Katie Halper.
Halper's criticism came a day after the New York Times deleted a controversial line in a Sunday article detailing Reade's allegations.
In her interview with Vietor, Marcotte claimed Reade worked in Biden's Senate office "like, for a few months in 1993, basically."
According to Reade, Biden explained away his advances by saying, "Come on, man, I heard you liked me," before telling Reade, "You're nothing to me."
Two former interns who worked with Reade told the Times Reade "abruptly stopped supervising them in April."
