Times executive editor Dean Baquet recently explained that the journalistic standard for assessing the credibility and newsworthiness of sexual assault allegations against political figures is "very subjective."
Baquet is right, but he should have said what everyone knows: Accusations of sexual assault against Democrats simply aren't as credible as accusations against Republicans.
The paper published its findings under an innocuous headline—"Examining Tara Reade's Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden"—more than two weeks after Reade made her accusation.
The paper referred to Ford as a "sexual assault survivor" who "delivered a harrowing tale of casual teenage violence that … captured the attention of the nation in the throes of a profound reckoning with the realities of sexual assault."
Which is just another way of saying "shut up" without having to admit what we all know to be true: Accusations of sexual assault against Democrats simply aren't as credible as accusations against Republicans.
