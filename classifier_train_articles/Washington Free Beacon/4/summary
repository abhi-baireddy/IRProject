On Monday, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden welcomed the endorsement of an unelectable socialist without a record of accomplishment aside from the "150 million" gun deaths he caused.
Biden warned in February that Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I., Vt.) influence would allow President Donald Trump to tar all Democrats as socialists.
He now says Sanders will play a key role in governing if the former vice president returns to the White House.
