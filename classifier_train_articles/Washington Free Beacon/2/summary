Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) defended blocking small business aid one day after the Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money and the Senate adjourned for the weekend.
You would still have more than half of the businesses left out and getting no money," Schumer said on Morning Joe Friday morning.
Schumer also pushed back on claims that Democrats were blocking funding, saying the claims weren't true and the program should be funded.
Senate Democrats Tina Smith (Minn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) called for immediate small business funding after their colleagues resisted Republican efforts to fund the program.
Other Senate Democrats denounced Republican efforts to fund the program.
