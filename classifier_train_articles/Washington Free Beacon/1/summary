Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) said in a new interview she is "thankful" people see the "fragility of our system" in light of the coronavirus pandemic and are thus more receptive to government remedies.
I cannot believe I didn't see this before,' and I'm just thankful that people are seeing it now."
Ocasio-Cortez pointed to increased support for Medicare for All, the single-payer health care system championed by fellow democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.).
House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D., S.C.) said the coronavirus gave Democrats a "tremendous opportunity" to advance their policy goals.
She previously said if she lived in a different country, she and Biden wouldn't belong to the same political party.
