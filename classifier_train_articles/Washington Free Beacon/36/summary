Scores of Iranian assets are currently frozen in many European bank accounts due to the Trump administration's tough sanctions regime on Iran.
The State Department slapped down these reports as false when asked by the Free Beacon to address the matter.
"These reports are inaccurate," a State Department official told the Free Beacon.
Iran has been seeking for years to gain access to frozen assets that have been held in escrow across Europe.
Those arguing for sanctions relief, including some European allies, want to see Iran granted access to these funds.
