A coalition of gun-rights groups filed a federal suit against Georgia officials on Thursday demanding that the state reopen its gun-carry permitting process or eliminate the permit altogether.
The Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) and Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) are challenging a Cherokee County decision to suspend its gun-carry permitting process as part of a broader effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Most state and local officials have allowed gun sales and permitting processes to continue, albeit at a slowed pace due to social distancing efforts.
Lawsuits focusing on the permitting process have enjoyed more legal success than those centering on stores.
Short of that, they are hoping to force officials to turn the permitting process back on.
