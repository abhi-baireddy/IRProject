China and Iran have both reported a tiny number of coronavirus cases compared to other affected nations, and on Saturday President Trump asked if anyone actually believes the rosy situations both those dictatorships are describing.

"You see what's going on over there," Trump said about the outbreak in Iran, gesturing at a bar graph showing different countries' affected populations. "Does anyone believe [Iran's] number? Does anyone believe [China's] number?"

"We saw more bags on television than that," he added.

Dr. Deborah Birx, who is on Trump's coronavirus task force, said she placed China on the graph to show how its rate, which is 0.33 per 100,000 deaths, is "unrealistic."

Birx said the U.S. fatality rate being below many other developed nations demonstrates the superior care being given to Americans hospitalized by coronavirus. She also said the fight is being won due to Americans' willingness to strictly adhere to social distancing.
