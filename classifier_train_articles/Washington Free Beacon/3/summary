China and Iran have both reported a tiny number of coronavirus cases compared to other affected nations, and on Saturday President Trump asked if anyone actually believes the rosy situations both those dictatorships are describing.
"You see what's going on over there," Trump said about the outbreak in Iran, gesturing at a bar graph showing different countries' affected populations.
"Does anyone believe [Iran's] number?
Does anyone believe [China's] number?"
Birx said the U.S. fatality rate being below many other developed nations demonstrates the superior care being given to Americans hospitalized by coronavirus.
