HOUSTON (AP) â€” A detained immigrant who said he tested positive for COVID-19 was required to call in for a court hearing even after a guard said he was too weak to talk, his attorney said.
Alonzo was hospitalized later that day, Semino said, and by Friday, she had not received an update on his condition.
The jail where he was detained went from two confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Thursday to 20 by Friday night.
Alonzo said officials at Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, where he's held, have told him that he tested positive for COVID-19.
Semino, his attorney, said she requested Tuesday that the hearing be delayed and followed up with the court the next day.
