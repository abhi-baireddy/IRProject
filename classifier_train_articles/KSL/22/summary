PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” Morgan Weaver laughed it off when her agent told her she was going to be the second pick in the National Women's Soccer League draft.
A four-year starter at Washington State, Weaver wasn't among the names getting a lot of buzz heading into the January draft.
First, she helped lead Washington State to the semifinals of the NCAA College Cup for the first time in school history.
The run came to an end in the Final Four, when Washington State fell 2-1 to North Carolina.
The Thorns traded up to the second pick to select Weaver.
