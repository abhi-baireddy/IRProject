The Navajo Nation, which includes parts of Utah's San Juan County, announced Friday that it will require all individuals to wear protective masks while in public.

That comes as the Nation announced 85 new COVID-19 cases Friday and three new deaths from the disease. Fourteen Navajo Nation cases have been confirmed in San Juan County so far.

"Even before the Center for Disease Control and Prevention officially recommended using masks in public, we were encouraging our Navajo people to wear masks and gloves and now we're putting it in writing," said Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez in a news release. "Some may not like it, but with the number of positive COVID-19 cases increasing, we have to be proactive in addressing the pandemic. We will continue to consider even more aggressive requirements to help bring the numbers down."

The Nation is under a weekend curfew until Monday, April 20 at 5 a.m., and is enforcing the curfew with road checkpoints. The Navajo Nation has been disproportionately impacted by the novel coronavirus.
