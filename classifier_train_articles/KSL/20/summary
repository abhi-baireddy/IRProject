SALT LAKE CITY â€” Meeting virtually on the second day of its emergency special session, the Utah Legislature passed a bill that creates a commission to advise Gov.
Hours after the bill passed, Herbert announced the "Utah Leads Together 2.0" plan to move to the next phase of the state's coronavirus response.
Some legislators expressed concern that SB3004 will create an overly aggressive and unsafe timetable for reopening Utah businesses, while others worried it will duplicate existing efforts on the governor's coronavirus task force.
The special session will continue next Thursday, April 23; Adams said he anticipates that will be the last day of the session, though he expects the governor to call more.
