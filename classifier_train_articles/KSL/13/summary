LONDON (AP) — A leading public health expert said Friday that Britain likely has the highest coronavirus death rate in Europe due to what he described as “system errors,” while the government defended its record in responding to the pandemic.
The British government reported that as of Thursday, 13,729 people had died in U.K. hospitals after testing positive for the coronavirus.
The number does not include hundreds, and maybe thousands, of virus-related deaths in nursing homes and other settings.
“What were the system errors that led us to have probably the highest death rates in Europe?” he said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the government’s record, saying “test, track and trace” was part of its strategy.
