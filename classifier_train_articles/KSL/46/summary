SALT LAKE CITY — Despite the statewide dismissal of schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, school crossing guards are still manning crosswalks as students shuffle in and out to collect homework packets and school meals.
Schools are closed due to COVID-19, but crossing guards still help students if they need to walk to school to get homework supplies or lunch.
In addition to increased potential exposure, Gray said that coronavirus’ spread across the state has made crossing guards’ schedules unpredictable.
We need to be watching for them, and that’s what these crossing guards are doing.
We need the community’s help to keep students and crossing guards safe.
