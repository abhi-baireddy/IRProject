WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is asserting that deaths from COVID-19 are much higher in China than in the U.S., when the opposite is true.
China has more than four times the population of the U.S. yet reported far fewer deaths: about 4,600 vs. more than 32,000 in the United States as of late afternoon Friday.
Trump routinely manipulates numbers and information to make the U.S response to the coronavirus pandemic look better than it is.
It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!”THE FACTS: It's the reverse.
China on Friday reported 4,632 deaths in total, up from 3,342, a spike due largely to previously uncounted deaths in Wuhan, the city where human infection by the coronavirus is believed to have started.
