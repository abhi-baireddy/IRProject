WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday he’s enlisting advisers from business, the medical field and elected office to join a new council that will help shape his plans to reopen the coronavirus-battered economy.
Trump said he would announce members of the panel later Tuesday at a White House briefing on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Fauci said Tuesday the U.S. does not yet have the critical testing and tracing procedures needed to begin reopening the economy.
Some ethics experts and participants in past councils created by Trump voiced concerns that the president may not be open to using the new panel to explore diverse viewpoints and hard truths about the best path forward.
New White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is expected to chair the effort.
