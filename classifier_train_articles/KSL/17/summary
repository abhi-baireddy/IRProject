SALT LAKE CITY — Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson announced on Friday that the stay-home portion of the county’s health order was being rescinded starting at 5 p.m.
However, social distancing guidelines are still in place and social and other gatherings are still prohibited in the order.
The order's name was also changed to "Stay Smart, Stay Safe," instead of the original "Stay Safe, Stay Home."
The mayor also addressed the rally some Utah business owners plan to hold Saturday in Salt Lake City, saying it was absolutely a violation of the order.
“As always, we continue to make evidence-based decisions here at Salt Lake County," Wilson said.
