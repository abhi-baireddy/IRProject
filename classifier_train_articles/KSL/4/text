THE HOME — Staying home and away from others isn’t all bad.

For most introverts, it’s almost like living life as normal (almost). But extraverts probably started dreaming of getting back into very public activities after about two days.

No matter where you fall on the spectrum, it’s fair to say that virtually all of us have come down with a little cabin fever and felt more than a little stir crazy. We’re all dreaming of travel and concerts and even just a simple trip to the library. But most of all, we’re likely dreaming about seeing and hugging our friends and loved ones who reside outside our personal isolation groups.

This video is a little gift and glimpse into our futures. It features two golden retrievers named Fiona and Winston that are BFFs. One is coming to visit the other, and neither can contain themselves even a little.

Even though she’s leashed on her way to the front door, Fiona breaks free when she sees Winston and rushes inside. Winston, on the other hand, is behind a child gate. But that doesn’t stop his excitement either. In fact, they are so excited that if the gate wasn’t there, a doggy body mosh pit may have punched some holes in the drywall.

And that is what is in our future, dear friends. Rushing to loved ones with our hearts on our sleeves and our tails a-wagging.
