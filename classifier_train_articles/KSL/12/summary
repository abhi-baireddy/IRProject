At least 100 epidemiologists, virologists, chemical engineers, toxicologists, biologists and military medical expert — all schooled in intelligence trade craft — work at the medical intelligence unit, located at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland.
“You feel like you’re looking for needles in a stack of needles," said Denis Kaufman, who worked in the medical intelligence unit from 1990 to 2005 and again later before retiring.
But unlike organizations such as the WHO, the medical intelligence team, part of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also has access to classified intelligence collected by the 17 U.S. spy agencies.
The medical unit can dig into signals intelligence and intercepts of communications collected by the National Security Agency.
But because the country is run by an authoritarian government, the medical intelligence researchers glean information from the local level, not Beijing.
