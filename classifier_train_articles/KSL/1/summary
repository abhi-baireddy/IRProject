This particular test drive didn’t turn out as I hoped, but it had nothing to do with the 2020 Honda Pilot.
I wish we’d been able to take the Honda Pilot for the 15-hour trip.
The 2020 Honda Pilot also earned a five-star crash-test rating from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Nice ride and handlingI would have loved to test the Pilot on my original route that included some gravel roads.
For Beehive State families who need room for kids, safety and reliability, the Honda Pilot certainly deserves consideration.
