SALT LAKE CITY — One of Utah’s top lawmakers will have a hand in reopening the American economy.
Sen. Mike Lee has been named to the Congressional Economic Task Force by President Donald Trump, the Republican senator's office announced Thursday.
“It is an honor to be chosen by President Trump to serve on the Congressional Economic Task Force,” Lee said in a news release.
Twenty-two Democrats are also on the task force.
None of the Democrats named to the committee voted to impeach Trump in recent senate hearings.
