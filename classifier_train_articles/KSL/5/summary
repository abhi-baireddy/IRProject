SALT LAKE CITY — Controversy over plans for a large rally has created a divide among some business owners — those that want to reopen the economy now, and those who say it’s still not safe.
KSL spoke with business owners on both sides.
The organizers behind Utah Business Revival argued that the state can open the economy now and maintain social distancing, even inside those establishments, to stay safe.
At first, St. Clair said business for him was way up, and then way down, in light of stay at home directives.
St. Clair said he supported the Utah Business Revival, and will be at what organizers have called a socially-distanced rally and picnic Saturday at 5 p.m.Not all business owners have been onboard with this thinking.
