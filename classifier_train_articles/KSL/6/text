Ninety-four men at a Salt Lake County homeless resource center have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a press release from the county.

Two cases of the disease were detected last week at the center, which was housing 205 men, according to the release. Precautions were put in place to prevent further spread of the disease, but the disease spread to 94 total residents of the facility.

The men who were diagnosed with the disease have been moved to a county isolation facility where they can be monitored for symptoms and be provided with three meals a day, the release said.

"The nature of a congregant living facility like a Homeless Resource Center creates unique challenges in the effort to slow the spread of the virus," the release said. "Social distancing is one of the most effective methods for slowing the spread of COVID-19, but that is especially challenging in a building that houses 300 people. Despite the significant efforts made by service providers and health officials, we have reached an unfortunate situation like that seen in other similar facilities across the country."

Men who did not test positive for the disease are still staying at the resource center and are getting health screenings twice a day, officials said.

The center is not receiving new residents, and no visitors are being admitted at this time, the release said.

County officials also have taken precautions at other homeless resource centers.
