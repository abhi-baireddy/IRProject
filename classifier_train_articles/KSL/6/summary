Ninety-four men at a Salt Lake County homeless resource center have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a press release from the county.
Two cases of the disease were detected last week at the center, which was housing 205 men, according to the release.
Precautions were put in place to prevent further spread of the disease, but the disease spread to 94 total residents of the facility.
"The nature of a congregant living facility like a Homeless Resource Center creates unique challenges in the effort to slow the spread of the virus," the release said.
County officials also have taken precautions at other homeless resource centers.
