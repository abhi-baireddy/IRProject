SALT LAKE CITY — Shelter the Homeless, which owns Salt Lake County’s three homeless resource centers, on Thursday announced the appointment of a new executive director.
“I am privileged to have the opportunity to serve as the new Shelter the Homeless executive director.
“The Shelter the Homeless board looks forward to working with Laurie as we support homeless resource center operators and other service providers in working to minimize homelessness and serve those in need.
The transition from the downtown Salt Lake City Road Home shelter to three smaller centers represented a major adjustment in how Utah seeks to serve its homeless community through targeted resources.
Shelter the Homeless was integral to that shift from one emergency shelter to three new homeless resource centers.
