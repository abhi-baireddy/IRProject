GRANTSVILLE — A man with a history of drunk driving was arrested again after police say he hit a pedestrian and drove off.

Daniel Vincent, 68, of Grantsville, was arrested Thursday for investigation of DUI, failing to remain at the scene of an injury accident, fleeing from police and reckless driving.

About 9:40 a.m. Thursday, a man was hit near Worthington and Durfee Streets in Grantsville and suffered a broken arm, according to a police affidavit. The driver side mirror from the suspect’s vehicle broke off and was still at the scene when police arrived.

Just before 12:30 p.m., police received a call of a reckless driver on I-80. Police said the description of the vehicle matched the one from the earlier incident.

“The reckless vehicle came down state Route 138 and I witnessed it at approximately Sheep Lane. The vehicle matched the description provided by the victim and had damage to the rear end and driver mirror, as described to me by the victim of the accident,” a Grantsville officer wrote in the affidavit.

The vehicle swerved into oncoming traffic multiple times as well as into the shoulder of the road, the affidavit says. The driver eventually stopped at Lamb Lane after the officer gave chase.

Vincent, who police say showed multiple signs of impairment, was arrested.

According to court records, Vincent was twice convicted of DUI in 2005 as well as a third case of intoxication, and has convictions for DUI in 2007, 2009 and reckless driving in 2019.
