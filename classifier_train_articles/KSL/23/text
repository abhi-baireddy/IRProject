SALT LAKE CITY — Saturday's numbers from the Utah Department of Health show 126 new cases of COVID-19 and two new coronavirus-related deaths.

That brings the Utah totals to 2,931 confirmed cases, with 25 total deaths from the disease. Previously, there were 2,805 cases in the state.

The total number of cases reported by the health department includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah’s outbreak began, including those who are infected now, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died.

Health department spokeswoman Charla Haney said both deaths were Utahns older than 60. One was a female Utah County resident, and the other was a male Salt Lake County resident.

The health department reports 4,173 new tests overnight. The new numbers indicate a 4.5% increase in positive cases since Friday. Of the 59,944 people tested in Utah so far, 4.9% tested positive for COVID-19.

Salt Lake County has more than half of the state's coronavirus cases at 1,547 total; Utah County has had 417, and Summit County has 316.

Seven Utahns were newly admitted to the hospital, according to the health department figures. There have now been 251 total hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 in the state. The health department estimates that at least 565 Utahns have recovered from the coronavirus.

The numbers come as government officials have begun the process of easing restrictions imposed after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Many state parks are now open to all visitors, and Salt Lake County's stay-at-home order has been rescinded.
