Spencer Cox is optimistic that the stateâ€™s economy may reopen sooner than officials previously estimated.
The COVID-19 numbers are promising in Utah, Cox said.
An early model from the National Guard estimated that by this week, Utah would have 9,600 total cases of COVID-19, with 1,200 hospitalizations, according to Cox.
"This is called flattening the curve and it shows that everything we are doing really is working," said Cox, who leads the Utah COVID-19 Community Task Force.
In an effort to increase testing, Utah expanded guidelines for who should get tested earlier this week.
