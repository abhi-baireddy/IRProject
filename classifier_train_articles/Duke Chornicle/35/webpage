<h3><strong>Update | 9:32 p.m. — Duke emails parents that students should get out of Durham</strong></h3>
<p>In a Monday night email sent from the Office of Parent and Family Programs, Duke parents were told that students living in off-campus residences should return home if they are able because Durham restaurants and resources were likely to be "severely curtailed or shut down fully as soon as today." The email noted that nothing about Durham had been issued yet. If students are unable to leave their apartments, the email advised, they should stock up on groceries and supplies.</p>
<p>The email also let parents know that if students are on campus and domestic air travel becomes impossible, then the student just needs to email keeplearning@duke.edu to arrange to remain on campus. It reminded parents that students should avoid campus if at all possible, and all events with more than 50 people are canceled until May 7. That includes off-campus events as well as on-campus ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Off-campus students are advised not to host parties or large gatherings and to practice social distancing.</p>

<p>In an email to The Chronicle, Mary Pat McMahon laid out the results of the Keep Learning Team's vetting process for students who requested to remain on campus for the semester or come to campus to gather belongings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the article, <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/03/duke-university-social-distancing-international-students-response-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">As Duke weighs students’ needs with social distancing, international students describe 'chaotic' response</a>:</p>
<p>"In total, the Keep Learning team received 4,400 total requests, and around 3,500 were unique individual students, McMahon wrote in an email Sunday night. She wrote that 463 students were approved to stay, 568 &nbsp;were denied, and another 195 were approved to stay on campus later than March 16 until they can arrange to leave. Around 2,200 wanted to access their dorms this weekend to take home their belongings.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 students initially requested to stay on campus, she said—too many people to allow for proper social distancing to slow the spread of the virus. This number included winter and spring athletes, she noted, but athletics is <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/03/duke-suspends-all-athletic-activities-due-to-coronavirus-concerns" target="_blank">no longer a reason</a> to stay since Duke suspended athletics activities March 12...&nbsp;</p>
<p>... McMahon wrote in an email that financial aid had worked with 250 students to book travel. She wrote that those 250 were presumably included in the 568 total rejections."</p>
