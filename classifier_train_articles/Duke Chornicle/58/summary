The students who would one day become the school’s first undergraduate class were in primary school when the idea was first formed.
When the idea of launching an undergraduate program with Duke’s degrees was brought before Duke’s faculty, they poked holes in the project for years before it went to a vote.
Under the agreement, Duke-NUS is modeled after the Duke University Medical School’s curriculum but is a part of the National University of Singapore System.
“A moment when nations and cultures are beginning to divest from the idea of the international order seems to me the time that needs something like the DKU undergraduate program more than ever,” Brodhead said.
The school aims to recruit 50 to 65 percent of each undergraduate class from China, and the rest from across the world.
