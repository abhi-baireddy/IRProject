The 6-foot-9 forward announced he would be returning to Duke for his sophomore year via Instagram Thursday evening.
Last season, Hurt recorded 9.7 points and 3.8 rebounds per game while hitting a team-high 42 long-range buckets on a 39.3-percent mark.
Just a day after Hurt's announcement, forward Wendell Moore Jr. also announced his return to the Blue Devils for his sophomore campaign via a similar Instagram post.
Of course, due to the coronavirus, we didn't get to see Hurt or Moore show off their growth in the ACC or NCAA tournaments.
Cassius Stanley had mentioned Hurt and Moore returning to Durham in his press conference last Friday, but no official announcements from Hurt or Moore themselves had been made until now.
