The Chronicle published a story March 6 detailing DKU students’ reactions to their university going online.
In three weeks, an entire campus moved its classes online.
Pickus described two key decisions that guided the transition: the online classes had to be of the highest quality, and they had to be equally accessible to all DKU students.
“This really gives me an opportunity to see what online learning and teaching is like,” she said.
And that in and of itself is valuable.”Pickus views the transition to online classes as purely an extension of DKU’s larger mission.
