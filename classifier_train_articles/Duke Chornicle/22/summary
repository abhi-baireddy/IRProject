It's the end of an era for Duke track and field and cross country.
According to a release sent by the team Thursday morning, director of track and field Norm Ogilvie has retired after 30 seasons on the Blue Devil coaching staff.
Ogilvie has been the head men's track and head men's cross country coach since 2000 while simultaneously holding the director of track and field position since 2003.
Duke's cross country and track and field programs have both seen major turnarounds under the direction of Ogilvie.
The release stated that associate head coach Shawn Wilbourn will be named interim head coach for track and field, while assistant coach Rhonda Riley will be named interim head coach for cross country.
