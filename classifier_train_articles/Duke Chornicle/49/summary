Tre Jones won't be winning any individual defensive awards, but the freshman is the reason Duke's man-to-man has gone to a new level this year.
Some coaches have hesitated to give credit to the Blue Devils’ floor general, instead attributing their players’ struggles to little more than an “off night.” But the Tre Jones Experience is real.

Jones is also not in the top 10 of any of the advanced defensive metrics, such as defensive win shares, defensive rating and defensive box plus-minus.
And all the while, Jones has helped to develop another young defender for the Blue Devils in sophomore Jordan Goldwire.
