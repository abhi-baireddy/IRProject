For some Duke students, leaving campus entails only of venturing to cafes on Ninth Street and exploring Main Street’s offerings downtown.
Oftentimes students fall into the Duke bubble and do not seek out the opportunity to engage with Durham’s rich history.
Geer Cemetery, located just three miles from Duke’s East Campus, was established in the 1870’s to lay more than 1,500 African Americans to rest.
Despite Geer’s proximity and ties to Duke, many students are unaware of its existence and much of the history that shaped its present state.
Seeing the damage firsthand allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the racism and neglect that led to Geer’s present state, a lesson that every Duke community member should absorb.
