During the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding social-distancing measures, student groups and university departments are making a concerted effort to ensure access to mental health resources and keep students socially connected.
Blue Devils Care has a feature called TalkNow, which allows students to speak with mental health providers at any time.
Students and student groups have also helped distribute mental health resources.
The Duke Student Government Academic Affairs committee compiled a guide to remote mental-health resources designed for use by Duke students, faculty and staff.
The 13-page document lists hotlines, tips for maintaining general wellness, Duke-specific resources, productivity and academic resources, and resources geared toward specific populations.
