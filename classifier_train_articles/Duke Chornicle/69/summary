However, the change in seasons seemed to bring good luck to the Blue Devils, who finished in the top-five in consecutive tournaments in March.
Webring Intercollegiate in Illinois, the Blue Devils shot even-par in the final two rounds to commandingly win the title over Wisconsin by 15 strokes.
However, a 2-under opening round left the Blue Devils in ninth and at risk of potentially missing the tournament.
Nonetheless, once again, a strong second round of 12-under pushed Duke into the top-five, after which it held on to finish in fifth.
However, the senior shut the door on the first try, canning a 25-foot eagle putt to put the Blue Devils over 3-2.
