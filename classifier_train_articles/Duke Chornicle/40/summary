Undergraduate students will now have a few more days to decide whether they'd like to be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale or receive a letter grade.
The University extended the deadline to April 27 at noon, five days later than the April 22 date outlined in the original post-COVID-19 grading policy shift.
The default grading option is S/U, so students have to opt in to a letter grade.
Bennett added that academic deans and college advisers will be available during reading period to discuss grading options with students.
