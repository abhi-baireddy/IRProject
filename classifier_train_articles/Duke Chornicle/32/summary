Editor's Note: This story contains discussion of mental health and suicide that readers may find triggering.
Over the course of my three years at Duke, I have struggled deeply with my mental health.
As a first-year, I spent my fair share of time at CAPS, where I was diagnosed for the first time with various mental health disorders.
It bears repeating: You really never know who is struggling with their mental health or who is suicidal.
They listened to me talk about how hard things were getting and let me detail every aspect of my mental health, even when it made them uncomfortable or overwhelmed.
