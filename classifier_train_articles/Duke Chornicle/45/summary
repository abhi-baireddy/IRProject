2 seed Tar Heels in pursuit of its first ACC championship in program history Sunday afternoon at MUSC Health Stadium.
North Carolina forward Zoe Redei found the back of the net just 47 seconds into the second half to score the lone goal of the contest.
Duke didn't have an opportunity in front of the net until Imani Dorsey's chance 10 minutes after the Tar Heels’ goal.
In the fourth minute, North Carolina defender Julia Ashley got a head on a long ball sent into the 18-yard box.
“We didn’t play very well in the first half, especially in the early part of the first half,” Church said.
