Senior Kate Rodgers said she’s thankful for the calming effect that Finnegan’s Intermediate Yoga class brings.
Similar to Finnegan, instructor Janis Hampton uses both recorded and live sessions to teach her fitness and sports classes, including Fusion Fitness, Fusion Fitness for Women, Beginning Tennis, Intermediate Tennis and Fitness for First Years.
In lieu of practicing tennis on a court, Hampton has her tennis students practice body movements for tennis techniques.
First-year Sophie Johnson, a student in Hampton’s Fitness for Women class, said the class has helped motivate her to continue exercising.
In addition to AIkido: Japanese Sword and Staff, he teaches Tai Chi and another Aikido class.
