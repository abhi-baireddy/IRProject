President Vincent Price has appointed two committees tasked with guiding Duke's short- and long-term plans as the COVID-19 pandemic poses logistical and financial challenges to the University.
The two groups—dubbed Team 2021 and Team 2030—will focus on pressing difficulties and big-picture problems, respectively.
The committees will collaborate with and consult many governing bodies within and outside of Duke, including Academic Council and Price's cabinet.
Price directed Team 2021 to "seek and mitigate impact on low-income students," according to the release.
Team 2030 will be chaired by Provost Sally Kornbluth and include the deans from Duke's 10 schools, among other administrators.
