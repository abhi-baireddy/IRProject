What does it mean to be a house course when students are now in different houses all over the world?
House courses are half-credit courses on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading scheme on a variety of subjects that interest students.
They are typically taught by student instructors under the supervision of a faculty adviser and meet once a week.
Most student instructors have elected to move to Zoom.
Summers hopes that house course instructors continue to find creative and exciting ways to adapt and overcome those difficulties.
