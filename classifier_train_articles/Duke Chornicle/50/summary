North Carolina State University runs its entire dining operation using university employees, with no outside vendors at all.
The one exception is the food trucks they started bringing to campus about six or seven years ago.
They have two main residential dining halls along with retail-type vendors like Subway and Einstein Bros. Bagels, which are franchised by the dining operator.
On Fridays, some food trucks visit campus, which Wise said serves as a “monotony breaker.”The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill combines in-house food with local vendors.
To that end, Duke Dining is continuously working to give students the best food it can.
