Haley Gorecki is officially taking her talents to the next level.

The former Blue Devil was taken by the Seattle Storm with the seventh pick of the third round in Friday's WNBA Draft.

Gorecki had a Duke career that will not be forgotten. The All-American came back from not one, but three serious injuries to earn back-to-back All-ACC First Team selections over the past two seasons. Although she never got to play in an NCAA tournament, she used these last two years to go from an unknown player to the person who opposing coaches construct their entire game plan around.

The Blue Devils will have big shoes to fill, as Gorecki led Duke in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals this past year. It is not set in stone that she will be on a WNBA roster after training camp, but she undoubtedly has the potential to be in the league for years to come. Her diverse skill set and seemingly tireless motor should set her up nicely with a spot in Seattle's backcourt.

Gorecki will likely take on a backup role for the time being, as the Storm have WNBA legend Sue Bird and rising star Jordin Canada filling both of their guard spots. Like many others, Gorecki is projected to spend some time overseas sharpening her skills before she makes a splash in Seattle.
