The former Blue Devil was taken by the Seattle Storm with the seventh pick of the third round in Friday's WNBA Draft.
Gorecki had a Duke career that will not be forgotten.
The Blue Devils will have big shoes to fill, as Gorecki led Duke in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals this past year.
Her diverse skill set and seemingly tireless motor should set her up nicely with a spot in Seattle's backcourt.
Like many others, Gorecki is projected to spend some time overseas sharpening her skills before she makes a splash in Seattle.
