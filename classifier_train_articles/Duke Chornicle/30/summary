This is part three of a three-part series about the raucous history of Duke students burning benches after major basketball victories, in the lead up to the North Carolina game Feb. 8.
Bench burning at Duke used to be defined by violence, chaos and impromptu fires.
Our goal is to support student safety and facilitate a campus-wide community event.‚ÄùFaculty, staff and students can serve on A-Team.
A-Team training covers the logistics of the bonfire, A-Team roles and fire safety expectations, Adams explained.
Later, A-Team members are invited to watch the game in the UCAE office in Few where they are provided dinner, she added.
