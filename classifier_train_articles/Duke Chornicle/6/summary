A Duke player hasn't been drafted since 2018, but two Blue Devils could be selected this year.
Haley Gorecki and Leaonna Odom both find their names on most mock drafts, with DraftSite projecting Gorecki as an early third-round pick and Odom as a late second-round pick.
Really fun and interesting chemistry they shared between them.
There is no doubt that Odom and Gorecki both have their work cut out for them to make a roster and succeed in the WNBA, but Gorecki did put the entire situation into perspective.
â€œJust keep on having fun," Gorecki said.
