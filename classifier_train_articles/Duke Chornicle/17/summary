After the nation focused its attention to the Wisconsin elections last week—which were held after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a delayed Election Day or mail-in ballots—Jill Karofsky emerged victorious in the hotly contested State Supreme Court race.
A circuit court judge since 2017, Karofsky, Trinity '88, was the liberal challenger to conservative incumbent Dan Kelly, whom President Donald Trump had endorsed.
In an upset victory, she won by more than 160,000 votes, a significant margin in a purple state that Trump narrowly carried in 2016.
When the governor postponed the election to June, the State Supreme Court overturned his ruling.
Karofsky's victory could carry major implications for voting procedures in November, as a Kelly win would have cemented the Court's conservative majority.
