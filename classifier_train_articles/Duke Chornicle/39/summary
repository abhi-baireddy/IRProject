Professor of Chemistry Steven Baldwin is a 50-year veteran at Duke whose teaching style depends on in-person lectures.
Thus, although there have been bumps along the way, many Duke professors have been successful moving their classes online.
For Roizen, online teaching was already part of her repertoire.
Even with her experience in online teaching, it’s difficult to know what students need when she can’t see their faces in a classroom.
Senior Brandon Bui, one of Baldwin’s teaching assistants, suggested they use the site to streamline all the students’ questions.
