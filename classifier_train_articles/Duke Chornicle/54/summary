Leaonna Odom was one of just three Blue Devils to put the ball in the basket Sunday.
The Blue Devils could not locate spot-up shooter Miela Goodchild, who was held scoreless for the first time this season.
Only a combination of a red-hot Gorecki and Florida State’s inability to hit a three kept Duke in the game.
But the Blue Devils stormed back in the third quarter, with Gorecki’s layup at the end of the period slimming the deficit to just six.
Simply put, the Blue Devils were outplayed in transition and on the glass, but neither of those aspects rely on skill alone—a concerning thought.
