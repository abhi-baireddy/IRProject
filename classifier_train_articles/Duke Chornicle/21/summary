If you watched Raj dance, it was unquestionably clear how much talent he possessed.
Out of all the people on the stage, your eyes followed Raj because of the gracefully powerful confidence he exuded while dancing.
Raj, thank you for sharing your smile that flashed from ear to ear and never failed to reach your eyes.
But most importantly, thank you for showing us what it means to live passionately and to love what you do.
Happy Birthday, Raj.
