Yet, with most college students in quarantine, this is one of the only methods we have to interact with other students.
Now that quarantine has forced most of our social interactions online, some Duke students have found unique ways of strengthening connections during this period of isolation.
Yes, bingo cards and the “see a dog, send a dog,” challenge cycled through my Instagram timeline, but I was particularly struck by a few Duke students who created social media accounts and series dedicated to staying connected during this disheartening crisis.
Several students have utilized the Duke Memes for Gothicc Teens Facebook group to laugh and lament with others about being away from the Duke community and transitioning to online classes.
His memes, whether about the unexpected end of senior spring or watching Netflix during class, remind us that even when we’re not physically together, we are still connected as Duke students.
