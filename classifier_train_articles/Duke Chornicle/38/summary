From the friends who had watched this play out for me a month earlier on social media, I was flooded with questions about how online classes work.
Other similar joint ventures like NYU Shanghai have already made the commonsense decision to allow students to Pass/Fail classes.
Our online classes began February 24, picking up about halfway through DKUâ€™s unique 7-week course schedule.
Does expecting a pass/fail option make me lazy?
Though the administration has dug in its heels, DKU students lack the strong advocacy network of an established institution to make their voices heard.
