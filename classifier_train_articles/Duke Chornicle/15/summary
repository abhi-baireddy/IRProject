With the third pick of the second round in the 2020 WNBA draft, Leaonna Odom becomes a Liberty.
New York had already drafted Sabrina Ionescu, Megan Walker, Jazmine Jones and Kylee Shook in this year's draft alone, leaving quite a crunch for bench minutes.
This has been a historically-loaded draft in terms of available talent, and in most years, Odom likely would’ve heard her name called quite a bit earlier in the evening.
Given her raw talent and the perceived gulf between her potential and her production, it’s been speculated that Odom may elect to go overseas.
For now, Kia Nurse, Rebecca Allen and Walker will likely sit above Odom on the depth chart.
