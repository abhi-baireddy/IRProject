With the cancellation of in-person classes since March 10, Bass Connections has been forced to change the format of their end-of-year events and, for some teams, the structure of field research, both domestically and internationally.
End-of-year events will now be held in a virtual format, Bass Connections Director Laura Howes said.
She explained that teams will be able to submit their research posters—which are presented at a public event—until the last day of classes.
However, projects that rely on field research or community partnerships have seen changes to their overall structures.
The team’s field research in Kenya has also been postponed, but the virtual showcase this year has allowed the team to explore different mediums of presentation.
