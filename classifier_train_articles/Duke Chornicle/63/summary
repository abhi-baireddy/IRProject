ATHENS, Ga.—When the lightning came, Duke trailed 8-1 and could not produce any offense against Fighting Camel ace Allan Winans.
"It probably looked like I should have been playing him a lot more," Pollard said.
"We had a couple of soft contact hits fall in, and once our guys kind of saw that, I think everybody sort of relaxed, took a collective deep breath and said, 'Okay, let’s just go play.'"
"We were still in the game, and it was just a matter of time before we got our break."
Duke will face the loser of Sunday's noon game between Georgia and Troy at 6 Sunday evening, needing a win to extend its season once again.
