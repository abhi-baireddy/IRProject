Other peer institutions, such as Cornell University and George Washington University, are also looking for presidents.
At the time, Columbia University, Yale University and the University of Chicago were all looking for new presidents as well.
Cornell's search process could impact how soon Duke selects its president, Burness said.
Public university systems looking for presidents include the State University of New York, the University of Missouri and Utah State University.
As a private university, Duke also has the advantage of dictating confidentiality under the search committeeâ€™s discretion.
