After a decade and a half in Congress, Duke alumnus Dan Lipinski has lost his seat.
Newman had challenged Lipinski in the 2018 primary but fell by just more than 2,000 votes.
“I am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition that helped bring about much needed change in our district,” Newman tweeted late Tuesday night.
Lipinski currently is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, which aims to bring Democrats and Republicans together for bipartisan solutions.
This will mark the first time since the early 1980s that a member of the Lipinski family hasn’t been the 3rd District’s representative.
