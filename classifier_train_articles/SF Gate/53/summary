Most Americans will be receiving checks from the federal government after President Donald Trump and Congress agreed to a $2 trillion coronavirus relief deal Wednesday.
Although the final legislative language is still being hammered out, here is what was proposed in regards to stimulus checks:— Individual taxpayers with incomes up to $75,000 will receive a one-time $1,200 direct payment.
Combined incomes of up to $150,000 will receive $2,400; the cap is a combined income of $198,000.
If you received an SSA-1099 form, you'll receive a stimulus check the same way you receive your Social Security payments.
The last time Americans got stimulus checks — in 2008 under George W. Bush — it took about three months for checks to arrive.
