The Oakland Hills home where former Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant lived is now listed off-market for $5,998,888.

First reported by the Mercury News, the 9,100 square foot home has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and includes two separate apartments. Amenities abound, including an in-home theater, a sprawling backyard and an expansive deck with sweeping Bay views.

You don't need to be out on the deck to enjoy the views, though. Floor to ceiling windows allow you to take advantage of the view from nearly every spot in the home.

And obviously, there's a basketball half court.

Andrea Gordon with Compass is the listing agent.

In 2017, this video of Kevin Durant livestreaming a tour of the home showcases the basketball court.

Durant spent three years in the Bay Area, winning two NBA titles and two Finals MVPâ€™s during his tenure with the Warriors. After tearing his Achilles tendon in the 2019 Finals, he departed for Brooklyn on a max deal.
