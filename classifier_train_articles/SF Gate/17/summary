In 12 states that did a better job reporting on whether patients worked in medicine, around 11% of cases were health care workers.
Compared with U.S. cases overall, larger proportions of diagnosed health care workers were women, were white, and were young or middle-aged adults.
That's consistent with the demographics of who works in health care, researchers said.
About 10% of the health care workers were hospitalized with symptoms, compared with 21% to 31% of overall cases.
That may reflect the younger age of the workers, as well as prioritization of testing for health care employees, the report said.
