Is California's internal coronavirus model showing a mid-to-late May peak realistic?
SFGATE reached out to California's Office of Emergency Services for information on the science behind the state's internal model but did not receive a response.
In addition to the emphasis on case doubling time, others have questioned the infection numbers the internal state model uses.
â€œThe IHME model is a blended model, it reflects what's going on in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, the Central Valley and it's not pulled apart," he said.
Rutherford agrees, and says he understands why California's internal model was geared towards a potential worst-case scenario.
