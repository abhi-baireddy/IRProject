What does "structurally deficient" mean, exactly?
California, as a state, ranked roughly in the middle of the pack in percentage of "structurally deficient" bridges.
Rhode Island, with its nation-leading 23.1 percent of its bridges considered structurally deficient, actually backslid from last year's numbers.
San Francisco's rate of structurally deficient bridges is actually lower than California's overall, with just seven total bridges in California's 12th congressional district (encompassing the vast majority of S.F.)
In the slideshow above, you can see the San Francisco bridges deemed "structurally deficient," as well as a handful of highly trafficked Bay Area-wide bridges in need of repair.
