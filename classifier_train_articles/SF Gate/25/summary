Economist Stephen Moore, who is on President Donald Trump’s task force to reopen the country, compared people protesting states’ stay-at-home orders to Rosa Parks.
In a YouTube video for “Freedom on Tap With Jon Caldara,” Moore says he’s helping plan a “drive-in” protest in Wisconsin against Gov.
We need to be the Rosa Parks here and protest against these government injustices,” Moore said.
“I call these people the modern-day Rosa Parks — they are protesting against injustice and a loss of liberties.”Sign up for Variety’s Newsletter.
