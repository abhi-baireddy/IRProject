San Francisco's Muni transportation agency is operating with skeleton service as San Francisco residents stay home under a shelter-in-place order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While ridership is down significantly, bus operators still serve approximately 100,000 passengers a day, Muni said in a statement.

This week, Muni is temporarily suspending some lines to prioritize "routes in most critical need during the pandemic." On Tuesday the following seven routes with low ridership will be discontinued: 2 Clement, 3 Jackson, 5 Fulton, 7 Haight, 10 Townsend, 21 Hayes and 31 Balboa.

On Wednesday, service will be further reduced and only the following 17 lines will continue to operate:

N Judah Bus

L Taraval Bus

T Third Bus

1 California

8 Bayshore

9 San Bruno

14 Mission

14R Mission Rapid

19 Polk

22 Fillmore

24 Divisadero

25 Treasure Island

29 Sunset

38 Geary

38R Geary Rapid

44 Oâ€™Shaughnessy

49 Van Ness/Mission

Muni has already cut all underground trains and replaced them with buses and eliminated many other bus lines including the usually-busy routes 5R, 9R, 28R and 38R.
