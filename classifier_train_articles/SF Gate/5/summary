Oakland officers lose discipline hearing over fatal shootingOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Five Oakland police officers facing termination over the fatal shooting of a homeless man lost an important step in their disciplinary process when a hearing officer affirmed a recommendation that they be fired, according to a news report Thursday.
The hearing officer, Michael Gennaco, agreed with the Oakland Police Commission's finding that the officers should lose their jobs because of their actions on March 11, 2018, when they shot and killed Joshua Pawlik.
Gennaco’s report is not the final step in the disciplinary process, the Bay Area News Group reported.
The Pawlik family’s attorney disputed the officers’ interpretation that Pawlik was about to fire his gun.
The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, which reviews all fatal shootings by police, concluded no crime was committed.
