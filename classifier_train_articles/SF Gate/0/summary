The childhood friends and co-creators of "The Last Black Man in San Francisco" joined State Sen. candidate Jackie Fielder for a virtual discussion on Thursday, where they talked about the current crisis and their plans for a new film set in San Francisco.
The childhood friends and co-creators of “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” have been sheltering in place together in the Mission District: cooking, watching movies, reading books and generally trying to stay sane as their lives are put on hold.
They’re also using their time in isolation to work on a new film set in San Francisco.
It’s been almost a year since “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” was released in theaters: a critically acclaimed love letter to the rapidly changing city they grew up in.
Inspired by Fails' own upbringing, it's an odyssey-like journey through a San Francisco he strives to belong to as he faces the ongoing threat of being priced out.
