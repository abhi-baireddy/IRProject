Johnsonâ€™s Port & Provisions already existed, but primarily as a resource for organizing events.
For $18, you can get a Port & Provisions dinner delivered to your house.
Port & Provisions has set up a "No Neighbor Left Behind" service that provides free meals to those in need, funded by contributions from the community.
They even see a future for the Port & Provisions delivery service beyond the pandemic.
