One obvious standout is "Parasite," the South Korean film that took the Oscars by surprise, sweeping the categories for best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best foreign film. The movie was released on Hulu last week, quickly becoming the second most-streamed film in the history of the service. Viewers should know that it is subtitled, but some have found this a nice reprieve during shelter-in-place, as it forces to put down your phone and concentrate fully on the film.

Other standouts include locals like "The Last Black Man in San Francisco" and "Sorry to Bother You," perplexing sci-fi like "Annihilation" and "Under the Skin," and heartwarming comedies like "Lady Bird and "The Big Sick."
