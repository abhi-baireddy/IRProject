PG&E to plead guilty to lethal crimes in 2018 wildfiresFILE - In this Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, file photo, sheriff's deputies recover the body of a Camp Fire victim in Paradise, Calif. Pacific Gas & Electric said Monday, March 23, 2020, it will plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the 2018 fire in Northern California that killed 84 people and decimated three towns.
Investors seemed pleased with the PG&E's plea as the company's shares surged more than 12% to close at $8.12 while the overall stock market tanked.
The Nov. 8, 2018, Camp Fire was fanned by strong winds, forcing thousands of people to quickly flee in their cars as flames ripped through the narrow canyon communities.
Newsom backpedaled in a Friday bankruptcy court filing, saying he now believes PG&E's plan qualifies it for the coverage.
Gavin Newsom has dropped all his objections to PG&E's bankruptcy plan.
