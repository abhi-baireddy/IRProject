Last night, I compiled a list of the most inspiring moments from the crisis. Whether it’s football coaches stepping up or Kendra Lust feeding hospital workers, I think I’ve put together a pretty cool list of the best moments.

Let’s dive right into the thread.

We’re going through some tough times during the coronavirus pandemic, and I’m going to shine a light on some people stepping up in the fight.

I think all the way around that’s one hell of a solid list of people stepping up across the country to help those in need.

We’re Americans, and we’ll always look out for each other in this country. Right now, we’re down and in a dogfight.

I have no doubt we’re going to eventually beat the hell out of this virus. That’s what Americans are all about.

Keep your family close, say a prayer if that’s your thing and do what you can to help others during this crisis.

Together, we will win.
