Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are facing criticism for traveling from Washington D.C. to New Jersey in violation of federal guidelines and her own instruction to Americans to stay home.

The New York Times first reported on Ivanka and Jared‘s travel from D.C. and noted her previous statement in a video where she told Americans, “Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so.”

“Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a senior White House adviser, traveled with their three children to the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey to celebrate the first night of Passover this month, according to two people with knowledge of their travel plans, even as seders across the country were canceled and families gathered remotely over apps like Zoom,” the Times reported.

The White House defended her travel amid coronavirus, saying, “Ivanka — with her immediate family — celebrated Passover at a closed down facility considered to be a family home.”

“Her travel was no different than had she been traveling to/from work and the location was less populated than the surrounding area near her home in D.C.,” the White House said, adding that it was “not commercial.” (RELATED: Trump Says He’ll Announce New Guidelines Thursday For Reopening The Country)

However, many in the media and political world are attacking the president’s daughter, accusing her of hypocrisy.

“THEY TOLD US not to leave our houses — stay home to stop the spread. Holidays are hard – they said they knew that – but do it for the common good,” Politico Playbook writer Jake Sherman wrote.

“There is not a single rule that applies to Ivanka and Jared. They are the chosen ones and it’s only the rest of us that have to follow the rules,” former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.

Author and reporter Kate Bennett called the travelling “Unreal.”

. @IvankaTrump posted videos saying “we’re all in this together.” Yet while so many Jews celebrated Passover alone or via video, Ivanka took her family to Bedminster. During a pandemic. After telling everyone else to stay home. Unreal. via @anniekarni https://t.co/trOcFdyzb5 — Kate Bennett (@KateBennett_DC) April 16, 2020

“In the absence of a compelling explanation of why this trip was necessary, it is hard not to recall the proclamation in George Orwell’s Animal Farm that ‘All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,'” New York Times reporter William K. Rashbaum said.

Wow. Do as they say, not as they do. As other Americans tried to flatten the curve by staying home or Zooming with their loved ones, Ivanka and Jared bypassed federal guidelines and went to Bedminster for Passover, @anniekarni reports. https://t.co/PHk6flKJcc — Katie Rogers (@katierogers) April 16, 2020

I am so late to this and can’t believe i missed it. Exhibition # 1 million of why Javanka is just the worst. The arrogance, the cluelessness, the entitlement, the total lack of self awareness. They are both just truly detestable. https://t.co/RXuTqabybh — Ilan Goldenberg (@ilangoldenberg) April 16, 2020
