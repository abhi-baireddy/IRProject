President Donald Trump says China should face “consequences” if it was knowingly responsible for the coronavirus becoming a pandemic.
Trump made the comments at a White House press briefing Saturday, further escalating his criticism of China and the World Health Organization.
He softened his critique by saying that if China had assisted the pandemic by “mistake,” then it was less punishable.
He said the U.S. would conduct a review of China’s handling of the virus after the pandemic has passed.
Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley has gone out ahead of the president, placing blame for the global pandemic directly on the Chinese government.
