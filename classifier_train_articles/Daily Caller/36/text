Countries around the world are taking vast measures to stave off the coronavirus, which has continued its spread from China and infected over 150,000 people internationally.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday, freeing up $50 billion in federal resources to combat the outbreaks domestically. The U.S. is also banning travel from Europe, most recently with the inclusion of the U.K., bringing the total of European countries affected by the ban to 28.
