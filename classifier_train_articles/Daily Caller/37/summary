A company run by U.S. military veterans has released a product that kills the coronavirus and could be available for small-quantity purchase within weeks.
Arteco Specialty Services introduced the Disinfect & Shield spray that kills the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, upon contact.
“If you have a high traffic room like a stadium or doctors office, spray it once, and it kills everything,” he said.
While it’s only available to purchase in mass bulk quantities currently, Haddad said the product is expected to roll out in 16 ounce containers for consumers in about 2 to 3 weeks.
“We’re bringing this to the mainstream because this has become top priority for every company in America, whereas 6 months ago it was priority number 50,” he said.
