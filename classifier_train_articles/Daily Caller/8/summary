An advocacy group that helps to confirm and defend President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees is railing against what it said is The New York Times’ lack of objectivity and conservative bias.
TheNYT’s work downplaying the allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden is a black mark on the paper’s legacy, according to The Article III Project, an advocacy group that works to support Trump’s judicial nominees.
The group lashed out at NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet in a letter Friday obtained exclusively by the Daily Caller News Foundation.
We found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Biden, beyond hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable,” TheNYT noted.
The group asked why the paper treated the accusations against Biden differently.
