WATCH:

Selina Soule, a high school track and field athlete, is speaking out after losing a spot in the girl’s track championship to two biological males who were allowed to compete as women thanks to the transgender policies in the state.

Soule explained:

When I was in the indoor season I was in the 8th place of the state open and only the top six qualify for the New England regional meet– because there were two transgender athletes that put me into 8th place, if they weren’t there I would have been in 6th and I would have made it into the finals and I would have qualified for the New England meet — instead of watching my own event from the sidelines.
