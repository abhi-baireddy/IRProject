WATCH:

Highly-decorated Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher is facing trial at the end of May for alleged war crimes.

The Daily Caller sat down with Sean Gallagher, Edward’s brother, to discuss the case. We also caught up with Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who has been leading the charge to help the SEAL.

Norman explained:

I’ve had some people tell me that you’re taking the side of someone who is a killer and I said, one, you don’t really know what you’re talking about, give me the evidence that you have that I don’t have. Two, who is against a fair trial? Who is against a man who has a family, a man who served this country? This was his last tour. Let’s have a fair trial and put him in a condition, living condition, so he can prepare the defense for his life.
