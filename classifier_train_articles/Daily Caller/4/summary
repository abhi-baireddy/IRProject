Kristi Noem and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working to put a meat processing plant ravaged by coronavirus back online after a worker died of the virus.
CDC staff canvassed the Sioux Falls Smithfield Foods plant Thursday weeks after the first COVID-19 case was discovered in March.
One infected worker died Tuesday while nearly 600 employees have tested positive for the virus, which has killed 100,000 people worldwide.
Smithfield Foods noted that it intends to open as soon as officials give it the good-to-go.
The wife of one worker who died from the virus said the plantâ€™s managers worked her husband to death.
