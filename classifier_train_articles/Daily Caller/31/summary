President Donald Trump announced at Wednesday’s coronavirus press briefing that he plans to unveil on Thursday a new set of guidelines for reopening the country.
The president has expressed his desire to reopen the economy on May 1, immediately following the conclusion of the current social distancing guidelines issued by the White House coronavirus task force.
“All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy,” he told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden.
“They gave us a lot of good ideas.”WATCH:In recent days, Trump has clashed with state governors over the timeline, and who ultimately holds the authority, for reopening communities.
On Monday, he insinuated that the president has “total” authority on such matters, prompting widespread criticism from governors, constitutional scholars and others.
