Roger Stone is one of the most infamous political fixers in American history.
The perpetually well-dressed former Nixon aide was arrested this week by the FBI in an early-morning raid of his residence in Florida last week.
Stone was indicted by a grand jury on charges brought by former FBI Director Robert Muellerâ€™s special counsel.
The charges included allegedly making false statements to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing a government investigation.
Stone pleaded not guilty to seven charges and was arraigned in federal court in Washington, D.C., Tuesday morning.
