Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that he was easing some of the state’s coronavirus restrictions a day after the White House released new public health guidelines, and just minutes after President Donald Trump called for the state to be liberated.

The new restrictions will allow outdoor activities, including hunting, fishing, and golfing to resume as long as social distancing protocols are followed. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Jan.21: Fauci Says Coronavirus ‘Not A Major Threat’ To U.S.)

“It’s important for us to stay active and enjoy the outdoors while preventing the spread of COVID-19,” Walz said, according to KEYC News. “This measure will allow Minnesotans to take advantage of more opportunities to get outside, while still doing their part to keep their neighbors healthy.”
