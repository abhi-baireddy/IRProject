Federal authorities arrested hundreds of individuals in connection to a Mexican drug cartel, the result of “phase one” in an ongoing operation to dismantle the organization.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) announced the results of the first phase of “Project Python” in a joint press conference on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the Justice Department repeatedly stressed how dangerous CJNG‘s presence is within the United States.
Project Python is an initiative spearheaded by the DEA that is targeting members of the CJNG.
“And with Project Python, we are delivering results in the face of that threat for the American people,” Benczkowski said.
