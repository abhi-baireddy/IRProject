Seeing as how the NFL draft is the only sports action going on, you have to bet on it. You just have to. You don’t have a choice.

If you’re a degenerate like I am, then call your bookie, fire up your app or however you bet, and start putting money on the line.

I’ve been missing that adrenaline rush. Not having stuff to gamble on might honestly be worse than contracting coronavirus.

Now, we’re less than a week away from the picks getting underway, and I can’t wait. Where will Tua go? Who will the Lions pick? Where will Justin Herbert land?

There are so many options on the table, and it’s going to be the injection of energy sports fans and gamblers need right now.
