The U.S. economy continues to screech to a halt as American industry saw a stark collapse in March.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing dropped 6.3% last month, while overall industrial production (factories, mining, utilities) sank 5.4%, according to the Federal Reserve.
These declines are the biggest the country has seen since 1946, when large-scale industrial production was slowed after the conclusion World War II.
More specifically, output from utilities dropped 3.9% and mines 2%.
Further, manufacturing in New York state saw its index bottom out, declining 57 points in April to an overall of -78.2, its lowest level since 2001.
