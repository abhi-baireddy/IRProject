On Saturday August 19, one week after the events of Charlottesville, Virginia, 40,000 people marched and rallied against an alt-right “free speech” protest in the Boston Common.
The anti-racist counter demonstration was announced less than a week prior and, according to Boston Police, drew over 40,000 people, a ration of 1600 to 1.
A few days before the march, Boston Socialist Alternative proposed to the International Socialist Organization that we form a Socialist Contingent for the march.
It was clear that 40,000 Bostonians didn’t just come out to stand against the 25 neo-nazis in the Boston Common Bandstand, but also against Trump, the racist billionaire who is helping to empower the alt-right.
Boston Mayor Walsh initially came out strongly against the white supremacists coming to Boston and in support of the counter demonstration.
