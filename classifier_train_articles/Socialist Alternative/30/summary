We have no job security year to year.
We are calling for job security after 4 years of working in the district, and a starting salary of at least $25,000.
We are proposing job security after 4 years, and the School Committee came back with a counter-proposal for 15 years.
We need all Somerville paras to get involved and all Somerville teachers.
The starting salary should be $25,000 and paras should have the right to job security after 4 years.
