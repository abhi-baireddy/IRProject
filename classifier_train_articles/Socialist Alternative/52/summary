In January, over 200 people participated in a stand out, followed by marching into the Somerville School Committee meeting.
Even after our packing of the School Committee meeting, which has never happened before in Somerville, the School Committee came back at the next bargaining session not offering one cent more!
Leading up to the School Committee meeting, paraprofessionals and teachers held successful walk-ins at schools across the district.
By standing together we can let the School Committee know that paras deserve full time wages for a full time job!
Weâ€™re going to keep this fight going and are leaving all options open to win a contract paras deserve!
