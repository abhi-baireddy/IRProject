The Stalinist system across Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union proved incapable of solving the national question.
Just a year later, in April 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to organize a new “Union of Sovereign States” comprised of 10 former Soviet republics.
It took less than a week for the new Soviet government to recognize Finland’s right to independence.
Today the region consists of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as eight Russian Republics, the best known of which is Chechnya.
National wars, inter-ethnic conflicts are clear examples of how the capitalists use the principle of divide and rule.
