In a lot of ways I think I’m one of the ”lucky” ones.
I don’t think it’s fair that kids are being asked to assume the risks of going out and keeping society running, keeping the shelves stocked, manning the cash-registers.
So I concentrate on things I think are important, or, things I am told are important, which are often aesthetic and not safety-related.
I’m really scared.
Because a better world really is just around the corner if we actually work towards it.
