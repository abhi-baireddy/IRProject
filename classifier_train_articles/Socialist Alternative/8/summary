Mike Brown’s death and the Ferguson rebellion was the spark of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.
The black working class of Ferguson sparked the rebellion that took aim not just at racist policing but at rampant inequality.
The American NightmareBlack Lives Matter began as President Obama declared a “post-racial” America.
The failure to achieve more decisive change on the core issues of policing and criminal justice generally was a serious setback for the Black Lives Matter movement.
