The Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs and Indigenous and non-Indigenous supporters are under siege.
The RCMP sealed off the area, refusing access to the Wet’suwet’en chiefs, land defenders and media.
The Wet’suwet’en’s allies include those who oppose more pipelines as well as those who support the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination.
Indigenous peoples have used the land in a sustainable way for millennia so it, in turn, can sustain future generations.
We stand in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en and other Indigenous peoples who are struggling for their future and the future of generations to come.
