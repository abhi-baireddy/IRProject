What started out as student survivors in Florida speaking out against Congressâ€™ inaction on gun control turned into a mass youth revolt.
The Democrats like to talk about gun control and opposing the NRA but their record of accomplishing anything on this front is fairly pathetic.
In order to win the demands of the student movement against gun violence, we certainly need to drive out the NRA-funded Republicans.
We support basic gun control demands like many of those being raised by the students leading this movement but we do not in any way see that as a fundamental solution to the many forms of gun violence.
You cannot separate the crisis of gun violence from the relentless violence promoted by the ruling class abroad in endless wars to protect corporate profits and at home to enforce segregation and crush any serious opposition to its rule.
