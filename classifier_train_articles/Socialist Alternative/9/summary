January 15 marked the 101st anniversary of the murder of the outstanding revolutionary socialist leader, Rosa Luxemburg.
[3] For Luxemburg such a strike movement was a “a partial manifestation of our general socialist class struggle”.
The essential role of a distinct revolutionary socialist party in the struggle for socialism was not demonstrated in practice until the 1917 Russian Revolution.
The lessons that must be learned from the ideas of Rosa Luxemburg, and also from the events that defined her life and death, are many.
Tomorrow the revolution will ‘rise up again, clashing its weapons,’ and to your horror it will proclaim with trumpets blazing: I was, I am, I shall be!”[4]Notes1 Leon Trotsky, 1919, “Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg”, www.marxists.org2 Rosa Luxemburg, 1900, Reform or Revolution, www.marxists.org3 Rosa Luxemburg, 1910, “The Next Step”, www.marxists.org4 Rosa Luxemburg, 1919, “Order Prevails in Berlin”, www.marxists.org
