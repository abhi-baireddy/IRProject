For the last 100 years, the auto industry has driven many of the technological development of capitalism.
Temporary workers, a growing feature of the world auto industry, were hit especially hard.
The big automakers demanded of their governments financial support, arguing that the collapse of the auto industry would have a knock-on effect, dragging other industries into the abyss.
In order to revive profits in the auto industry, a number of countries introduced “scrapping premiums” in 2009.
Through these measures, as well as increasingly long-term car loans and further cutting labour costs, the auto industry somewhat recovered from 2008.
