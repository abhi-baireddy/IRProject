Today marks the launch of the new website of our sister organization in Mexico, Alternativa Socialista!
We recognize that international class struggle is necessary to fight back against the capitalist system, which organizes on the global stage to steal profits from workers and accumulate exhorbitant resources.
In an attempt to undermine class struggle, the ruling class uses nationalism to redirect anger toward other workers and weaken our movements.
Meanwhile, far-right demagogues like Donald Trump blame immigrant workers for what in actuality are failures of the capitalist system, sowing tensions between native-born and foreign workers.
Struggle in the United States and in Mexico is intimately linked â€“ geographically, economically, and for many, personally.
