They built alliances with sectors of the old oligarchy and right wing, like the corrupt ex-President Arnoldo Alem√°n.
In the case of Nicaragua there can be no question of siding with Ortega in the face of this massacre.
It certainly does not mean that the Left should defend Ortega because of the reactionary intentions of sections of the right and imperialism.
The movement must reject any alliance with the bosses, right wing, imperialism or the Church.
Only on this basis can a real alternative to Ortega, the traditional right and imperialism be built.
