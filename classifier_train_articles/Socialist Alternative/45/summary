BOSTON — Grocery workers from across the city and their supporters gathered outside a Boston Whole Foods to demand that frontline workers receive the protections they need during the coronavirus crisis.
Workers and customers maintained social distancing guidelines while protesting, staying at least six feet apart from each other at all times.
Earlier this month, a worker from a grocery store near Boston died after contracting the virus.
The changes made by Shaw’s are good, but much more is needed and all companies need to step up.
The coalition hopes their organizing can serve as inspiration to grocery workers across the country to come together, figure out what they need to stay safe, and demand it of their companies.
