The Little Rock School District (LRSD) has been under state control since 2015, and teachers want the city to regain power over both public schools and charter schools.
In retaliation, the state reminded teachers that they could be fired and rallied substitute teachers as strike breakers.
While the one-day strike was a step forward in the fight against state control, teachers have shown that they are committed to a long battle to win their demands.
The Walton Family Foundation founded the Arkansas State Teachers Association (ASTA), an anti-union organization that opposes the LREA.
The fight against the privatization of the education system must be coupled with demands for fully-funded public education.
