Militant Côte d’Ivoire (CWI group in CI)Militant Côte d’Ivoire is calling for solidarity with workers at the SCCI (Société pour le Compoundage en Côte d’Ivoire), a chemical factory in Vridi industrial zone (in Abidjan, the country’s capital) in their struggle over a bonus that was owed by their boss but never got paid – and against the reprisals they have suffered as a result of their strike action.
This includes some workers who had been working there for more than 20 years.
The workers called on Militant Côte d’Ivoire and the CWI for assistance.
A series of meetings already happened in Vridi, and a thousand leaflets have been distributed by our group, not counting those shared by the workers themselves.
I have also been informed that you are now demanding that these workers pay you a fine of 6 months’ wages, allegedly to reimburse you for the profits you lost during this one day strike.
