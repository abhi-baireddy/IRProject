Youth fighting for their futureThe atmosphere reflects the enormous confidence which the student movement has won following the historic defeat of the right wing and election of AMLO in the elections on 1 July.
The student movement shows, yet again, not only the anger but also the revolutionary potential of the youth.
Trained and controlled by high-ranking functionaries and politicians, they have played a historic role in violence to dismantle the student movement and its most important leaders.
If we do not remove all of these instigators of violence, the “porros” will regroup sooner or later.
The structural violence we suffer under capitalism can only be stopped through mass, conscious and organised struggle!
