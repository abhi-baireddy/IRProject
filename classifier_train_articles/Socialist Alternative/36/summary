The movement behind Bernie Sanders is viewed as an existential threat by the Democratic Party establishment.
Here’s why the Democratic Party is not a tool we can easily morph to our liking and wield to advance our cause:1.

The next step in this process needs to be a decisive break from the Democratic Party elite and the formation of a new political party of, by, and for working people.
