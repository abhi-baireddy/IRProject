On March 12th the legislative session ended with no ban even coming up for vote- a big blow to big business and a big sigh of relief for the affordable housing movement.
However, the legislature also failed to pass any new progressive taxes on big business to fund urgently needed housing or public health measures to combat the COVID19 epidemic.
With a series of bills in Olympia, big business had been ready to agree to grant King County the authority to tax big business up to roughly $150 million in exchange for inserting the poison pill of a ban on Seattle raising any taxes on big business.
However, we donâ€™t have illusions in Mayor Durkan or the majority of the City Council who clearly see no urgency in taxing big business.
Our movement to tax big business to provide relief to workers during this crisis could spread across the country like our fight for $15 an hour.
