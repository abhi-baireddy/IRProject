Educators who are members of St. Paul Federation of Educators (SPFE) were on strike for four days, reaching a tentative agreement with the St. Paul school district on March 13.
St. Paul educators entered the struggle for better public schools as the latest in the #RedForEd strike wave with picket lines at each school during the day and mega rallies in the afternoons during the course of the three day strike.
Why did St. Paul educators take the step to go on strike?
The Chicago Teacherâ€™s Strike won literally every demand they put on the bargaining table over their three week strike, very similar demands to our own.
Educators from Chicago were able to send members with their valuable experiences in organizing to help out in St Paul.
