Many people new to the socialist movement may wonder: What are the differences between Socialist Alternative and Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)?
Socialist Alternative and DSA are two of the best known socialist organizations in the country.
The socialist movement has to be world-wide and internationally coordinated, which is why Socialist Alternative is in political solidarity with a recently renamed worldwide organization called International Socialist Alternative, along with revolutionary socialist parties in over 30 countries across the world.
Though many DSA members would consider themselves internationalists, DSA is not part of an international socialist organization or network of socialist parties.
Recently, Socialist Alternative and our worldwide organization, International Socialist Alternative, have gone through major debates.
