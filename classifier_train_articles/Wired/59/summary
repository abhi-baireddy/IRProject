Wil Wheaton has a new enterprise.
Wheaton, who played Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation, is now hosting a The Ready Room, a new aftershow for the CBS All Access series Star Trek: Picard.
While geek culture now dominates Hollywood, Wheaton realizes that not everyone shares his passion for Star Trek.
He notes that his own wife, Anne Wheaton, does not enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation.
“Because everything triggers a memory.”He’s optimistic, though, that Picard may be the show that finally converts his wife to Star Trek fandom, based on her reaction to the early episodes.
