Veronica Roth is the bestselling author of the Divergent novels, which were adapted into a series of popular films.
She says that the story of the series’ hero, Tris Prior, was influenced by some of her favorite books.
“It made me curious about what the psychological repercussions of saving the world would be,” she says.
“For every murderous creep that exists, there are a bunch of people who think he’s cool,” Roth says.
I find those folk tales to be particularly dark and weird, and that was where I found a lot of stuff.
