Wouldn’t it be cool if you could do physics experiments on your phone, without needing a lab full of special instruments?
You might not know it, but your phone contains a bunch of awesome sensors, like an accelerometer and a magnetometer.
They also have a whole list of experiments you can do at home, like turning your phone into a sonar to measure the speed of sound.
I decided to try this one, using the phone’s barometer to study pressure.
The idea is that the weight increases the air pressure inside the bag, and you can measure the difference with the phone.
