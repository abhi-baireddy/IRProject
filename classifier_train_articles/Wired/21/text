Wouldn’t it be cool if you could do physics experiments on your phone, without needing a lab full of special instruments? Actually you can, with a free app called PhyPhox. It records data using the sensors in your smartphone. You might not know it, but your phone contains a bunch of awesome sensors, like an accelerometer and a magnetometer.

Honestly, this is a great tool. It was created by some people at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. They also have a whole list of experiments you can do at home, like turning your phone into a sonar to measure the speed of sound. Or putting it in a salad spinner to study circular motion. Or swinging it on a string to derive the gravitational constant.

I decided to try this one, using the phone’s barometer to study pressure. Here’s the setup:

Set your phone to display the atmospheric pressure.

Put it in a sealed plastic bag with some extra air in there.

Place a square of cardboard on top, and an apple on top of that.

Record the pressure reading.

Here's what this might look like. Instead of an apple, I put 55 grams of weights on top of some Lego bricks. The idea is that the weight increases the air pressure inside the bag, and you can measure the difference with the phone. Nice!

A Homemade Pressure Gauge

Now for a question: Suppose you used a smaller cardboard square (or fewer Lego blocks), so that the weight is pushing down on a smaller area. Would the pressure in the bag be: (a) the same, (b) greater than, or (c) less than with the large square?

Go ahead and think about this. Discuss your prediction with your friends. It will be fun. OK, ready? Let’s go over some physics. What is pressure, actually? We can define it like this:
