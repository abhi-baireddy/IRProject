Evil cults, like the one that appeared in last year’s Midsommar, are among the most popular movie villains.
Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley notes that horror movie cults tend to fall into four main categories—pagan (The Wicker Man), Satanic (Rosemary’s Baby), cosmic monster (The Void), and Manson-style (Martha Marcy May Marlene).
Horror author Paul Tremblay says he’s much more frightened by cults that might actually exist.
“What I thought was really interesting about The Endless, and what really stuck with me, wasn’t any of the weird Lovecraftian stuff,” she says.
People will try to escape, but they’ll miss being in it so much that they’ll go crawling back.
