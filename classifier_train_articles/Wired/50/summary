The Apple-Google proposal, announced Friday, is designed to record when two people come near one another without revealing their identities or location.
Apps that use the contact tracing scheme could automatically alert public health authorities and provide users with information regarding testing and self-quarantine.
Before the Apple-Google announcement, dozens of research groups and cybersecurity professionals had proposed similar digital contact tracing efforts, some of which also used combinations of Bluetooth and cryptography to guard user privacy.
The scale and nature of the coronavirus pandemic make digital tracing appealing.
The effectiveness of contact tracing relies on identifying people who appear healthy but are carrying the virus; if those people aren’t tested, their contacts won’t be recorded.
