Science fiction editor John Joseph Adams says he didn’t even hear about it until it started showing up on lists of the best TV shows of 2019.
Science fiction professor Lisa Yaszek likes that the show focuses on a large, diverse family.
I mean, their world is kind of a crappy world, but the world we live in now is kind of a crappy world.
I’ve never seen that in a science fiction show.
Before I even knew anything about science fiction, I read this book called The Millennial Project, which was basically a science fiction nonfiction book teaching you how to build a science fictional future.
