Security researcher Trammell Hudson analyzed the AirSense 10—the world’s most widely used CPAP—and made a startling discovery.
Although its manufacturer says the AirSense 10 would require “significant rework to function as a ventilator,” many ventilator functions were already built into the device firmware.
Its manufacturer, ResMed, says the $700 device solely functions as a continuous positive airway pressure machine used to treat sleep apnea.
The researchers are clear that Airbreak shouldn’t be used on any device treating a patient suffering from Covid-19—at least not yet.
Additionally, a patch from ResMed could be installed much more quickly and reliably on more recent devices that have over-the-air update capabilities.
