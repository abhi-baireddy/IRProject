Since Covid-19 began its spread across the world, technologists have proposed using so-called contact-tracing apps to track infections via smartphones.
Now, Google and Apple are teaming up to give contact-tracers the ingredients to make that system possible—while in theory still preserving the privacy of those who use it.
On Friday, the two companies announced a rare joint project to create the groundwork for Bluetooth-based contact-tracing apps that can work across both iOS and Android phones.
Google and Apple declined to say which specific groups or government agencies they’ve been working with.
In the version of the system set to roll out next month, the operating-system-level Bluetooth tracing would allow users to opt in to a Bluetooth-based proximity-detection scheme when they download a contact-tracing app.
