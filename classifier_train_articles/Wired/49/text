Long before I was forced to stay indoors, I spent most of my time ... indoors. I built a PC back in college (with the help of some friends), and ever since then I've continued perfecting my home office setup—switching desks, keyboards, monitors, and more.

When many of my friends and colleagues were forced to quarantine because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, I realized most people don't have home workstations like mine. So, my fellow folks privileged enough to be able to work from home during this crisis, below are some picks that might make working from home more bearable. Most have been tested by WIRED's Gear team and we're recommending others based on customer reviews across retailers, what other sites have to say, and our experience with the brand.
