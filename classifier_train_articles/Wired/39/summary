That is, Krammer was building a blood test for Covid-19.
Survivors of a disease keep antibodies to that pathogen in their blood; they’ve “seroconverted,” which is to say their blood and immune system have changed.
A blood test can’t—at least, not until the infection is far enough along that the immune system has kicked into gear.
But a blood test can tell if someone has already been infected and gotten better.
“Some people get asymptomatic infections or mild infections and never get detected, but they become, most likely, immune,” Krammer says.
