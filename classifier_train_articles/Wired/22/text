We're still stuck at home, but despite the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, there are still some good deals out there. This week we've seen great price cuts on a slew of Android phones, as well as half off PopSockets pop-up phone grips.

This weekend we've got even more deals for you on everything from tablets to telescopes. Note that some of these items have shipping delays due to high demand during the pandemic, but if you don't mind waiting for your stuff, you can score a deal today.
