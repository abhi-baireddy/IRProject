The new Lovecraftian horror movie Color Out of Space is the first major project from director Richard Stanley since he was fired from The Island of Dr. Moreau back in 1996.
Horror author Paul Tremblay thinks it’s likely that the documentary played a key role in rehabilitating Stanley’s reputation.
'”Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley says that Color Out of Space is an enjoyable horror movie that reminds him a lot of Annihilation, one of his all-time favorite films.
I really, really love it.
And [Color Out of Space] is—I don’t want to say it’s the poor man’s Annihilation, but it is sort of a goofier version of Annihilation.
