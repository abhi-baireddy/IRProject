First, a seemingly controversial opinion: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a good movie.
There are films that qualify as movies and movies that qualify as films, but Rise of Skywalker is definitely a movie.
It was built, by someone who knows how to make a paint-by-numbers blockbuster under the auspices of the Disney juggernaut, to win.
as many folks as possibleâ€”lifelong Star Wars fans, movie critics, people who loved The Last Jedi, people who hated The Last Jedi, ReyLo shippers, the gays.
What unspools after that is a series of quests and fake-outs leading up to one epic battle, just like every Star Wars movie that came before.
