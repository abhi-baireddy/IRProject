The images made by German-born photographer Mat Hennek instantly evoke the Covid-19 pandemic that has shut down most of the world.
Actually, though, Hennek began working on his Silent Cities series in 2013.
Steidl's publication of a book of the images earlier this month is pure coincidence—the project was years in the making.
“It’s really crazy.”Hennek shot the series in dozens of cities around the world over the past seven years.
To take some of the images, Hennek had to wait several hours for the perfect moment.
