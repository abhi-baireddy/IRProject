The site, Eat Your Books, is niche, but if you cook a lot and own a bunch of cookbooks, it's excellent.
If that stack comes up to your waist, Eat Your Books will likely be very helpful.
I make stock all the time, but searching for a recipe in Eat Your Books gave me options and ideas.
Thanks to my recipe search, though, I was reminded of the pressure-cooker technique for beans in Melissa Clark's Dinner In An Instant.
Eat Your Books came up aces again, helping me find lamb siniyah: spiced, ground meat with a tahini "crust."
