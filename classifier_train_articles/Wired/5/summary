Ordinarily, Big Darby cradles 44 of Ohio’s 60 or so species of freshwater mussels.
In North America, home to one-third of the world’s freshwater mussel species, more than 70 percent of the mussels are imperiled or have been driven to extinction by pollution, habitat destruction, and other human-made hardships.
But mass mussel casualties like those in Big Darby are relatively new, and they are happening worldwide.
As early as 2004, Ohio ecologists began sounding alarms about declines in the richness of mussels in Big Darby Creek.
“I tell people freshwater mussels are not the charismatic megafauna,” the late Ohio State mollusk curator Tom Watters told Columbus Underground magazine in 2019.
