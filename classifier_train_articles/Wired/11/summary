On Instacart, orders have surged to an all-time high in recent weeks as its workforce of 350,000 “shoppers” ferry groceries between stores and American households.
But two weeks later, Instacart workers say the kits still haven’t come.
The spokesperson also says that Instacart was prepared to send supplies to all 350,000 workers.
There’s no waiting list workers can get on—they have to keep checking carrotswag.com to see if pre-orders are open again.
None of this was clear to the Instacart workers who spoke to WIRED.
