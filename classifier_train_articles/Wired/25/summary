“Kids can still get severe disease from this coronavirus, particularly if there are other risk factors, including heart disease and lung conditions,” he says.
Now doctors have the additional conundrum of figuring out why babies and toddlers seem to be at higher risk than school-age kids.
Being an infant or having preexisting lung problems and immunocompromising conditions both raise the risk that kids will experience more severe coronavirus infections.
A study of 10 kids with Covid-19 in China, published last month, found the virus in their poop for up to 30 days after they first started showing symptoms.
Still, the idea of asymptomatic spreading has been one of the main arguments for closing schools and keeping kids separated from elderly relatives.
