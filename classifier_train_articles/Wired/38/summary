I'm not sure I would say LEGO blocks are that expensive, but the statement is that they are expensive because they are so well made.
I will combine all the 2 bump LEGO blocks together since they seem to be from a similar distribution.
Honestly, I don't know much about plastic manufacturing - but the LEGO blocks appear to be created from harder plastic.
Basically, I looked at the price of different LEGO sets along with their pieces.
The cool thing about all of the LEGO sets is that the number of pieces is always listed.
