There’s only so much you can do at the scene of the investigation; eventually, you need to send samples back to the lab for further analysis.
Broadly speaking, scientists want to bring back Mars samples to address three different sets of questions: geological, biological, and technological.
Shrinking one down to size and getting it to Mars would be a costly engineering project you’d need to manage before even looking at your first Mars sample.
Scientists have been thinking for decades about the kinds of experiments they could do once they have samples back on Earth.
This graduation from sending information back to Earth to sending actual Martian stuff back to Earth involves fundamental changes in the way we think about space exploration.
