You don't have to pay an arm and a leg for a new iPhone anymore. Apple has brought back the popular iPhone SE, and it starts at $400 even as it sports the same powerful A13 processor as its much pricier siblings.

The iPhone SE does come with compromises, though. Depending on your perspective, those compromises may not be ideal and perhaps you'd be better off with another iPhone. We've also rounded up some of the best deals we could find on the SE. Preorders are now live, and initial orders should ship one week later.

Updated on April 17: We've added deals from Visible, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint.
