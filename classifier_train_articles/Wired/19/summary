The only way I know that it’s Friday is that this newsletter goes out and my weekly food delivery arrives.
The difference is that with the newsletter, there’s no note that some of the items aren’t available at this time.
The first leader cited, in the agriculture category, is a lobbyist from Georgia named Zippy Duvall.
I know that it’s childish to make fun of someone’s name, but starting off with a guy named Zippy isn’t exactly a confidence builder.
Looking over the other categories, most include the CEOs of large companies, but there are some wild cards.
