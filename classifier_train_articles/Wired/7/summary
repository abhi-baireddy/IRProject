An updated version of the US Air Force’s trusty F-15 Eagle fighter jet had its first flight test recently and demonstrated its bag of tricks with a dramatic, nearly vertical “Viking takeoff”.
The new F-15, which first entered service in 1976, isn’t intended for American fighter jocks—at least not right away.
Instead, Boeing is developing the jet for the Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF), which is due to get the first models in 2021.
When the Air Force gets the upgraded jet, presumably later this decade, it will be known as the F-15EX and will serve alongside the F-35 fighter jet.
As the Air Force sees it, the new F-15 will complement F-35s in combat, with the latter using its stealth capabilities to penetrate air defenses and the F-15s will unleash their heavier payloads.
