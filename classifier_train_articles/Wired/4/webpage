On January 22, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it was all business as usual. He [promised](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/cnbc-transcript-president-donald-trump-sits-down-with-cnbcs-joe-kernen-at-the-world-economic-forum-in-davos-switzerland.html) CNBC’s Joe Kernan there were no worries about a pandemic: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”\n\n+++\n\nA month later, Trump’s message was the same. “It’s going to disappear,” Trump [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-african-american-leaders/) of the coronavirus on February 27. “One day—it’s like a miracle—it will disappear.” Then, as it became clear the virus wasn’t going away, Trump has instead tried to avoid blame, arguing that the novel coronavirus pandemic is a black swan, an unimaginable, surprise, out-of-left-field event. “This was unexpected,” he [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-republican-senators-2/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header) on March 10. “It hit the world.” On March 16 Trump [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-3/), “This came up—it came up so suddenly. Look, he was surprised; we were all surprised.” And on March 24, he [told](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-fox-news-virtual-town-hall/) a Fox News town hall, “Nobody ever expected a thing like this.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n#### Share Your Stories\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e7e5bceadfa9d0008e095ca]\n\n##### We want to hear from you for our [Covid Spring](https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-spring/) oral history project.

Over the past quarter century, warnings have been clear and consistent from both US government leaders, scientists, and global health officials: A pandemic was coming—and whenever it arrived, it would be catastrophic to the global economy. In recent years red alerts have come almost monthly—sometimes weekly—and all three of Trump’s predecessors have dedicated significant personal time and public attention to the pandemic threat.\n\nThe most recent warning, a [bipartisan report](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/final-report/) by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cochaired by former US senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, and Julie Gerberding, George W. Bush’s one-time director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was published on November 18, 2019—one day after we now know that the first case of the novel coronavirus that would be later be named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China's Hubei Province. That report’s number-one recommendation was to undo the Trump administration’s cuts to pandemic planning: “Restore health security leadership at the White House National Security Council.”\n\nA careful review of past reports, books, planning documents, Congressional hearings, op-eds, speeches, and public testimonies make clear that all the problems of the current Covid-19 crisis were foreseen over the past 15 years, as officials and leaders like Bill Gates warned in increasingly dire terms about the government’s lack of sufficient preparation.\n\nAs early as 2005, President Bush [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/politics/bush-announces-plan-to-prepare-for-flu-epidemic.html), “Our country has been given fair warning of this danger to our homeland.” Eight years ago, a report by the US Department of Health and Human Services cited the need to develop “social distancing” models to inform how we combat the spread of a pandemic; it also pointed to potentially dangerous shortfalls in ventilator stockpiles and noted that there were local shortages of masks during the H1N1 pandemic, though these were filled by the national stockpile equipment. Repeated public warnings came even from those on the front line of today’s response, including Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar and Anthony Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDespite substantial progress during the Obama administration—which grappled with the H1N1 scare and the 2014 Ebola outbreak and was so concerned about the threat of a pandemic that it even highlighted the threat in a [tabletop exercise](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797) with incoming officials during the transition—the Trump administration let pandemic planning efforts lapse.\n\nThat trend, too, was clear early. As early as seven weeks into the Trump administration, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were raising concerns that the Trump administration was undermining pandemic preparedness efforts. As she and four other members of Congress [wrote](https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2017_3_13_Letter_to_CDC.pdf) then to Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, “Actions taken by President Trump could also impair our readiness in the face of a public health crisis, such as a flu pandemic.”\n\nThe truth is, it isn’t just the Trump administration that failed to sufficiently heed the tsunami of warnings. Leaders in state and local government, industry, and multinational institutions—all of whom share the responsibility to be prepared—were equally on notice that a pandemic was coming. But in the United States, we look to the federal government to lead the efforts on problems too big and too complex for any one jurisdiction or company.\n\nThe following oral history of public pandemic warnings has been compiled from government and other official reports, medical journals, videos, books, op-eds, congressional hearings, news articles, statements, and other public records. None of the following quotations are backward-looking “I told you so’s”; all are contemporaneous, forward-looking warnings and predictions. None was classified; all but one was publicly released and available for all to read. The one document not released to the public: A National Security Council pandemic playbook reportedly written by the Obama administration in 2016 and [passed off](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285) to the Trump administration in 2017.\n\n*Editor’s Note: If you’d like to read previous installments of our [Covid Spring](https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-spring/) series, Chapter 1  dealt with [patients and those on the front lines of the response](https://www.wired.com/story/first-denial-then-fear-covid-19-patients-in-their-own-words/) across the country. Chapter 2 featured the [voices of eight Americans](https://www.wired.com/story/birth-death-weddings-an-oral-history-of-covid-19-disruptions/) who have watched what would normally be some of the biggest and most quintessentially human moments in their lives—births, weddings, loved ones’ deaths—remade and altered forever by the virus’s shadow. Chapter 3 featured the [voices of New Yorkers](https://www.wired.com/story/new-yorkers-once-again-at-ground-zero-in-their-own-words/) at the center of America’s Covid-19 epidemic. Last week’s Chapter 4 featured [Jewish and Christian faith leaders](https://www.wired.com/story/here-in-spirit-oral-history-of-faith-amid-pandemic/) about Passover and Easter in a time of anxiety and quarantine. Also, for ease of reading, certain acronyms in the quotations below have been written out.*\n\n### I. The Clinton Era\n**Laurie Garrett,** [The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance](https://www.amazon.com/Coming-Plague-Emerging-Diseases-Balance-dp-0374126461/dp/0374126461/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)*, October 1, 1994*: Many aspects of history are unanticipated and unforeseen, predictable only in retrospect: the fall of the Berlin Wall is a single recent example. Yet in one vital area, the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases, we can already predict the future—and it is threatening and dangerous to us all.\n\n**[White House Press Release](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd_ntsc7.htm)**, *June 12, 1996*: Calling emerging infectious diseases a growing global health threat, Vice President Gore today announced President Clinton’s new policy to establish a worldwide infectious disease surveillance and response system and expand certain federal agency mandates to better protect American citizens. “Emerging infectious diseases present one of the most significant health and security challenges facing the global community,” Vice President Gore said during remarks to the annual meeting of the National Council for International Health in Crystal City, Virginia. “Through President Clinton’s leadership, we now have the first national policy to deal with this serious international problem.”\n\n### II. The Bush Era\n**Gardiner Harris,** *“[From Washington, a Story About a Killer Flu](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/weekinreview/from-washington-a-story-about-a-killer-flu.html),” The New York Times, October 16, 2005*: This week, the Bush administration is expected to release its pandemic flu plan, which could generate its own movie epic. The *Times* obtained a draft of the plan, dated September 30. No one would confuse the 381-page document with a screenplay, but pages 45 through 47, the section titled “Pandemic Scenario—Origin and Initial Spread,” are gripping. They describe a flu epidemic moving from a village in Asia to the United States, where it causes panic and as many as 1.9 million deaths.\n\n**Excerpt, “Pandemic Scenario—Origin and Initial Spread,” White House planning scenario:** During the peak of disease activity in the community, police, fire and transportation services are limited by personnel shortages, and absenteeism at utility companies leads to spot power outages. Supplies of food, fuel, and medical supplies are disrupted as truck drivers become ill or stay home from work. In some areas, grocery store shelves are empty and social unrest occurs. Long lines form where food and gasoline are available. Elderly patients with chronic, unstable medical conditions hesitate to leave their homes for fear of becoming seriously ill with influenza. Riots occur at some vaccination clinics as people are turned away or supplies run out. Several trucks transporting vaccine are hijacked, and a gray market develops for vaccine and antiviral drugs—many of which are counterfeit … Family members are distraught and outraged when loved ones die within a matter of a few days. Public anxiety heightens mistrust of government, diminishing compliance with public health advisories. “Worried well” seek medical care despite their absence of influenza illness, further burdening the health care system. Mortuaries and funeral homes are overwhelmed.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n#### SIGN UP TODAY\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5be5e669a2e9765d4710ab4c]\n\n##### Sign up for the [Backchannel newsletter](https://www.wired.com/newsletter/?name=backchannel&sourceCode=CarveLeft2) and never miss the best of WIRED.\n+++\n\n**President George W. Bush,** *[National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/pandemic-influenza-strategy-2005.pdf), November 1, 2005*: Once again, nature has presented us with a daunting challenge: the possibility of an influenza pandemic. Most of us are accustomed to seasonal influenza, or “the flu,” a viral infection that continues to be a significant public health challenge. From time to time, changes in the influenza virus result in a new strain to which people have never been exposed … Although the timing cannot be predicted, history and science suggest that we will face one or more pandemics in this century.\n\nThe next pandemic is likely to come in waves, each lasting months, and pass through communities of all sizes across the nation and world. While a pandemic will not damage power lines, banks or computer networks, it will ultimately threaten all critical infrastructure by removing essential personnel from the workplace for weeks or months.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** *Secretary of Health and Human Services, “[HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/professionals/hhspandemicinfluenzaplan.pdf),” November 2005*: One of the most important public health issues our nation and the world faces is the threat of a global disease outbreak called a pandemic. No one in the world today is fully prepared for a pandemic—but we are better prepared today than we were yesterday—and we will be better prepared tomorrow than we are today … History teaches us that everything we do today to prepare for that eventuality will have many lasting benefits for the future. We will realize important advances in health care, and we will be better prepared for other types of emergencies. I am humbled by the enormity of the challenge that the global community confronts should there be a pandemic. Public cooperation and global partnerships will be essential tools in fighting back and creating a constant state of readiness. If together we take the steps necessary, we will be able to save the lives of millions of people in our country and all around the world.\n\n**Excerpt, Congressional Budget Office, “**[A Potential Influenza Pandemic: Possible Macroeconomic Effects and Policy Issues](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6946/12-08-birdflu.pdf)**,”** _December 8, 2005,  revised July 27, 2006_**:** During a severe pandemic, hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices would probably be overwhelmed, and surveillance (keeping track of where the disease was and where it was going) would be difficult. Health care workers would be exposed to the disease, resulting in further strains on the health care system’s capacity, as some workers became sick and others stayed home to care for family members or to avoid becoming ill. Care for non-acute health problems would be sharply curtailed.\n\nAs the pandemic progressed, international travel would dramatically decline, as people avoided avian flu “hot spots” and governments restricted travel. It seems unlikely that domestic and international air travel would cease completely, but as a point of reference, at the peak of the SARS outbreak in April 2003, airline passenger arrivals in Hong Kong had declined by nearly two-thirds relative to their levels in March. In all likelihood, people would quarantine themselves and their families by staying at home more. Nonessential activities that required social contact would be sharply cut, which would lead to significant declines in retail trade. People would avoid public places, such as shopping malls, community centers, places of worship, and public transit. Attendance at theaters, sporting events, museums, and restaurants would decline. It seems likely that many schools would close, and even if they did not, attendance would fall dramatically as parents kept their children at home. In either event, large-scale school closings would lead to a spike in workplace absences because parents would stay home to care for their children even if they were not sick.\n\n**Homeland Security Council, [](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/pandemic-influenza-implementation.pdf)**[National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/pandemic-influenza-implementation.pdf)\\*\\*, *May 2006:* History suggests … another novel influenza virus will emerge at some point in the future and threaten an unprotected human population. The economic and societal disruption of an influenza pandemic could be significant. Absenteeism across multiple sectors related to personal illness, illness in family members, fear of contagion, or public health measures to limit contact with others could threaten the functioning of critical infrastructure, the movement of goods and services, and operation of institutions such as schools and universities. A pandemic would thus have significant implications for the economy, national security, and the basic functioning of society.\n\nUnlike geographically and temporally bounded disasters, a pandemic will spread across the globe over the course of months or over a year, possibly in waves, and will affect communities of all sizes and compositions. In terms of its scope, the impact of a severe pandemic may be more comparable to that of war or a widespread economic crisis than a hurricane, earthquake, or act of terrorism … Preparedness for a pandemic requires the establishment of infrastructure and capacity, a process that can take years.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** _Secretary of Health and Human Services, [Pandemic Planning Update II](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/panflureport3.pdf), November 13, 2006_**:** A year ago, few Americans had heard of avian flu. Today, awareness is high. There has been a deluge of news reports, and we’ve had not one, but two made-for-TV bird flu movies. This past year, a nearly forgotten word, pandemic, reentered our vocabulary. And then the media moved on. There is a danger that as avian flu slips from the headlines, people will believe the threat is no longer real.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** _[Pandemic Planning Update VI](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/panflureport6.pdf), January 8, 2009_**:** The history of pandemics is not so much the history of health as it is the history of humanity. When pandemics strike, they cause massive sickness and terrible loss of life. They even reshape nations … Today, many people mistakenly think influenza pandemics are a thing of the past, but influenza has struck hard in the era of modern medicine—much harder than most people realize. And it will strike again. Pandemics are hard things to talk about. When one discusses them in advance, it sounds alarmist. After a pandemic starts, no matter how much preparation has been done, it will be inadequate … I believe we can prepare successfully for a pandemic. But it will require determination. It will require change.\n\n### III. The Obama Era\n**Dennis C. Blair,** *director of national intelligence, [Annual Threat Assessment of the Intelligence Community](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/20090212_testimony.pdf), February 12, 2009*: The most pressing transnational health challenge for the United States is still the potential for emergence of a severe pandemic, with the primary candidate being a highly lethal influenza virus. The World Bank estimates that if the next pandemic virus is similar to the one that caused the 1918 pandemic, it could kill 71 million people worldwide and cause a major global recession with global costs exceeding $3 trillion.\n\n**Dennis C. Blair,** *director of national intelligence, [Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/20100202_testimony.pdf), February 2, 2010*: The current influenza pandemic is the most visible reminder that health issues can suddenly emerge from anywhere in the globe and threaten American lives and US strategic objectives. It also highlights many of the United States’ critical dependencies and vulnerabilities in the health arena. But like an iceberg, the visible portion is just a small fraction of the myriad of health issues that will likely challenge the United States in the coming years. Significant gaps remain in disease surveillance and reporting that undermine our ability to confront disease outbreaks overseas or identify contaminated products before they threaten Americans.\n\n**Kathleen Sebelius,** *Secretary of Health and Human Services, [2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/h1n1-retrospective/Documents/2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf), May 29, 2012*: In the approximately three years since the start of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has continued our efforts to improve the nation’s readiness for a future influenza pandemic. It is essential that these efforts continue since influenza viruses with pandemic potential continue to spread widely in animals and sporadically infect humans, and the place and time of the next pandemic cannot be anticipated. Prior pandemic preparedness efforts and investments provided the groundwork for the 2009 H1N1 response; now those preparedness strategies and plans need to be adjusted to incorporate real world experiences and recent technological advances.\n\n**Executive Summary, [](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/h1n1-retrospective/Documents/2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**[2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/h1n1-retrospective/Documents/2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**, HHS, 2012:** The 2009 H1N1 pandemic arose against a backdrop of five years of pandemic planning efforts—including efforts on the part of the United States and the international community as a whole—to develop, refine, and regularly exercise pandemic plans at national, state, and local levels, and to engage the private sector and nonprofit partners … A severe influenza pandemic can affect society well beyond just the health and medical sectors. Potentially high rates of illness (25 - 30 percent of the US population) and death could affect critical infrastructure, private-sector activities, educational institutions, and the movement of goods and services across the nation and the globe—resulting in significant economic and security consequences. Workplace absences due to high rates of illness and death among not only those who are sick, but also among caretakers of the ill, could have a significant impact on employers and the economy.

As such, the HHS maintains ventilators in the strategic national stockpile for a future pandemic or other public health emergency to augment state and local needs …  Results of a survey conducted in the summer of 2009 showed great geographic variation in the nation’s population-adjusted ventilator supply and revealed that the nation’s supply is higher per capita than any other developed country, albeit significantly lower than the current estimated need during a severe pandemic … If a large proportion of the US population were to become severely ill during a pandemic and required mechanical ventilation, the health care system would quickly become overwhelmed.\n\n**James R.

The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. Its entire budget for influenza was just $7.7 million in 2013—less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies. It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever. It alone has the mandate and legitimacy to serve as a health protection agency for all countries, rich and poor.

A more crowded and interconnected world is increasing the opportunities for human and animal diseases to emerge and spread globally … The world’s population remains vulnerable to infectious diseases because anticipating which pathogen might spread from animals to humans or if a human virus will take a more virulent form is nearly impossible. For example, if a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus like H7N9 were to become easily transmissible among humans, the outcome could be far more disruptive than the great influenza pandemic of 1918. It could lead to global economic losses, the unseating of governments, and disturbance of geopolitical alliances.\n\n**Bill Gates,** _Gates Foundation cofounder, “[We’re not ready for the next epidemic](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/We-Are-Not-Ready-for-the-Next-Epidemic),” blog post, March 18, 2015_**:** The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a tragedy—as I write this, more than 10,000 people have died.

Also, last month I was lucky enough to have an in-depth discussion with Tom Frieden and his team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. What I’ve learned is very sobering. As awful as this epidemic has been, the next one could be much worse.

Ebola was, in many ways, a deceptively simple test of the world’s epidemic response system. Ebola is hard to transmit and easy to detect. The epidemic broke out in three relatively small countries that contained no mega-city and sent only a limited number of travelers out of the region. The next time, the world might face a far more dangerous threat. A pandemic flu could be spread easily and quickly, carried by individuals with no obvious symptoms. It could explode like a wildfire in a massive city and be carried overnight by thousands of travelers to the world’s major commerce centers.\n\n**James R.

Land-use changes will increase animal-to-human interactions and globalization will raise the potential for rapid cross-regional spread of disease, while the international community remains ill-prepared to collectively coordinate and respond to disease threats.

But that commitment was short-lived … The prevailing laissez-faire attitude toward funding pandemic preparedness within President Donald Trump’s White House is creating new vulnerabilities in the health infrastructure of the United States and leaving the world with critical gaps to contend with when the next global outbreak of infectious disease hits.\n\n**Bruce Sterling**_, [](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2018/10/massive-planetary-epidemics/)_[WIRED](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2018/10/massive-planetary-epidemics/)*, October 15, 2018*: Massive planetary epidemics—the way we carry on nowadays, we’re kinda begging for one of these.\n\n**Ronald Klain,** *“[A pandemic killing tens of millions of people is a real possibility—and we are not prepared for it](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17948062/pandemic-flu-ebola-h1n1-outbreak-infectious-disease),” Vox, October 15, 2018*: In an era with so much progress in science and medicine, how can the United States remain so vulnerable to such a pandemic? With so much money and energy being devoted to combatting large-scale terrorist attacks, nuclear proliferation, and other dangers, why has so much less attention been devoted to a threat that is arguably more likely and potentially deadlier? … The past two decades have seen a roll call of near-miss catastrophes.\n\nNew political and social trends further increase our risk level … The ability of social media to rapidly spread false information—painfully illustrated in the 2016 campaign—is another source of danger: Would the directives of public health officials be followed in a crisis? Would they be undermined by misinformation spread by misguided provocateurs or a hostile foreign power? And then there is the risk factor of isolationism and xenophobia. While responsible officials in the Trump administration have responded to two Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo this year…in a more visible crisis, Trump’s isolationist instincts might assert themselves … No city in America has existing capacity (i.e., treatment units within a hospital supported by trained staff and equipment) to treat more than a handful of dangerous infectious diseases patients at one time … An outbreak of even just a few dozen cases of a deadly, highly infectious disease—let alone a few hundred—would overwhelm any city in our country. In such a scenario, death would beget death, as patients carrying the virus would stream into hospitals and infect others who did not yet have the disease … We need to step up our investment in facilities, training, and equipment for our domestic epidemic response—and do so now, not when a crisis comes.\n\n**Bill Gates,** _“[What I learned at work this year](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018),” December 29, 2018_**:** I had hoped that hitting the 100th anniversary of this epidemic would spark a lot of discussion about whether we’re ready for the next global epidemic. Unfortunately, it didn’t, and we still are not ready … If anything is going to kill tens of millions of people in a short time, it will probably be a global epidemic. And the disease would most likely be a form of the flu, because the flu virus spreads easily through the air … To be prepared, we need a plan for national governments to work together. We need to think through how to handle quarantines, make sure supply chains will reach affected areas, decide how to involve the military, and so on. There was not much progress on these questions in 2018.\n\n**Alex Azar,** _Health and Human Services Secretary, [National Biodefense Summit](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2019-speeches/remarks-to-the-national-biodefense-summit.html), April 17, 2019_**:** The thing that people often ask is: “What keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world?” Pandemic flu, of course.\n\n**William Brangham and Judy Woodruff**_, “[Why another flu pandemic is likely just a matter of when](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-another-flu-pandemic-is-likely-just-a-matter-of-when),” PBS Newshour, June 18, 2019_:  Judy Woodruff: Public health officials fear the emergence of a new, previously unknown flu virus that could be far more lethal and become a pandemic by spreading across the world … William Brangham: [Dr. Anthony] Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. He says while many take the so-called seasonal flu for granted, it still kills tens of thousands in the US every year. But the seasonal flu isn’t really what Fauci loses sleep over. It’s the concern that a new flu strain emerges, a virus we have never seen before and have no protections against, like what happened in 1918.\n\n**Susan Brooks,** _US Representative, Republican, Indiana’s fifth district, [PBS Newshour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-another-flu-pandemic-is-likely-just-a-matter-of-when), June 18, 2019_**:** We have not given [a pandemic] all of the attention that it deserves. Every time you do an exercise, you realize where the gaps are. If large numbers of people begin to get sick, actually, your economy is impacted, our national security can be impacted. There are so many things that people just don’t realize. These are the types of things that most citizens don’t think about. We don’t want to think about them. Yet we expect the systems to be in place to take care of them. We expect the medical community, pharmaceutical community, diagnostic community, everyone to be ready. And that’s not how it works.\n\n**Ronald Klain,** _[Third Annual Pandemic and Biosecurity Forum](https://www.c-span.org/video/?460710-4/pandemic-biosecurity-policy-summit-part-2), Texas A&M University, May 14, 2019_**:** We need leadership at the White House. I do not think it should be the vice president. The vice president has a full-time job. Getting ready for and responding to pandemic threats is also a full-time job. And the idea the vice president would do it in his spare time, doesn’t seem like a good idea to me. President Obama after he brought me in to do the Ebola response—when I left, we were getting close to zero cases—appointed a senior member of the National Security Council staff to be in charge of pandemic response, and President Trump continued that for the first year of his presidency. That position has been terminated. I hope that President Trump changes his mind.\n\n**Excerpt, [](https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_Annual_Report_English.pdf)**[“A World At Risk: Annual Report](https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_Annual_Report_English.pdf)**,” Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, The World Bank and World Health Organization,** _September 2019_**:** For too long, we have allowed a cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: We ramp up efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them when the threat subsides. It is well past time to act … What we need is leadership and the willingness to act forcefully and effectively …  The world is not prepared for a fast-moving, virulent respiratory pathogen pandemic …  In addition to tragic levels of mortality, such a pandemic could cause panic, destabilize national security and seriously impact the global economy and trade. Trust in institutions is eroding. Governments, scientists, the media, public health, health systems and health workers in many countries are facing a breakdown in public trust that is threatening their ability to function effectively. The situation is exacerbated by misinformation that can hinder disease control communicated quickly and widely via social media.\n\n**Excerpt,** _“[Preparedness for a High-Impact Respiratory Pathogen Pandemic](https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/thematic_papers/tr-6.pdf),” Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, September 2019_**:** The potential for an epidemic or pandemic caused by a high-impact respiratory pathogen is increasing. Data show that the frequency of outbreaks of newly emerging diseases is rising. Novel pathogens continue to emerge, often first in animals, then with subsequent spillover into human populations living in close contact with animals, due to changing patterns of animal management and land use. Global conditions enable pathogens to spread widely and quickly in people.\n\n**Laurie Garrett**_, “[The World Knows an Apocalyptic Pandemic Is Coming. But nobody is interested in doing anything about it](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/20/the-world-knows-an-apocalyptic-pandemic-is-coming/),”_ Foreign Policy, *September 20, 2019*: This core message has been shouted from the rafters many times before, with little discernable impact on tone-deaf political leaders, financial enterprises, or multinational institutions. There’s no reason to think this time will be any different. It’s hard to know what, shy of a genuinely devastating pandemic of killer influenza or some currently unknown microbe, will motivate global leaders to take microscopic threats seriously.\n\n**Ronald Klain,** _“[The Ebola Epidemic is in Full Swing—Where is the Trump Administration?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/01/ebola-epidemic-is-full-swing-where-is-trump-administration/)“, Washington Post, October 1, 2019_**:** Warning lights are flashing in our global health security system … There is no substitute for leadership at the White House. When John Bolton took over as national security adviser in 2018, [he disbanded](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tim-ziemer-global-health-security-leaves_n_5af37dfbe4b0859d11d02290) the National Security Council unit that worked on pandemic prevention and response. The White House has tried to cut investments in global health security, the president only discusses the threat of epidemics when he is stirring fears to bash immigrants … As epidemics rage and the risk of a pandemic mounts, the lack of leadership at the White House in confronting this threat feels larger every day.\n\n**Julie Gerberding and Kelly Ayotte,** _cochairs, CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security, “[Ending the Cycle of Crisis and Complacency in U.S. Global Health Security: A Report](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/191122_EndingTheCycle_GHSC_WEB_FULL_11.22.pdf),” November 2019_**:** Over the course of our careers, we have witnessed, often up close, a mounting number of severe health security incidents, including the 2001 anthrax attacks, SARS in 2003, and the recurrent, dangerous outbreaks of influenza and Ebola, to name but the most conspicuous. Not only did these moments demonstrate the staggering public health, economic, and political costs borne of infectious disease outbreaks and biological attacks, they have convinced us that the United States needs a far better line of defense.\n\n**Excerpt, “**[Ending the Cycle of Crisis and Complacency in US Global Health Security](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/191122_EndingTheCycle_GHSC_WEB_FULL_11.22.pdf)**”:** The business case to invest early in preparedness is crystal clear—and powerful. The United States must either pay now and gain protection and security or wait for the next epidemic and pay a much greater price in human and economic costs. The long-term costs of strategic protection and prevention programs are but a tiny fraction of the astronomic costs of episodic, often chaotic responses to sudden, emergent crises. Investing strategically now is smart and cost-effective, brings proven results, and would draw support from across the political spectrum.\n\n**Julie Gerberding,** *[Biological Threats to US National Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=NhJUXma5XNM&feature=emb_logo), video, November 22, 2019*: We are living in an age of epidemics.\n\n**Josephine Ma,** [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back)*, March 13, 2020*: The first case of someone in China suffering from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, can be traced back to November 17.\n\n**Donald Trump,** *[Press Briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feycmqjsLNw&feature=youtu.be&t=2625), March 13, 2020*: No. I don’t take responsibility at all.\n\n***\n*Nora McGreevy contributed research and reporting to this article.*\n\n***\n*WIRED is providing [free access](https://www.wired.com/tag/wired-free-access/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Coronavirus&itm_content=footer-recirc) to stories about public health and how to protect yourself during the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.wired.com/tag/coronavirus/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Coronavirus&itm_content=footer-recirc).

Bush’s one-time director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was published on November 18, 2019—one day after we now know that the first case of the novel coronavirus that would be later be named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China&#x27;s Hubei Province. That report’s number-one recommendation was to undo the Trump administration’s cuts to pandemic planning: “Restore health security leadership at the White House National Security Council.”</p><p>A careful review of past reports, books, planning documents, Congressional hearings, op-eds, speeches, and public testimonies make clear that all the problems of the current Covid-19 crisis were foreseen over the past 15 years, as officials and leaders like Bill Gates warned in increasingly dire terms about the government’s lack of sufficient preparation.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>As early as 2005, President Bush <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/politics/bush-announces-plan-to-prepare-for-flu-epidemic.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/politics/bush-announces-plan-to-prepare-for-flu-epidemic.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a>, “Our country has been given fair warning of this danger to our homeland.” Eight years ago, a report by the US Department of Health and Human Services cited the need to develop “social distancing” models to inform how we combat the spread of a pandemic; it also pointed to potentially dangerous shortfalls in ventilator stockpiles and noted that there were local shortages of masks during the H1N1 pandemic, though these were filled by the national stockpile equipment.

Long lines form where food and gasoline are available. Elderly patients with chronic, unstable medical conditions hesitate to leave their homes for fear of becoming seriously ill with influenza. Riots occur at some vaccination clinics as people are turned away or supplies run out. Several trucks transporting vaccine are hijacked, and a gray market develops for vaccine and antiviral drugs—many of which are counterfeit … Family members are distraught and outraged when loved ones die within a matter of a few days. Public anxiety heightens mistrust of government, diminishing compliance with public health advisories. “Worried well” seek medical care despite their absence of influenza illness, further burdening the health care system.

In all likelihood, people would quarantine themselves and their families by staying at home more. Nonessential activities that required social contact would be sharply cut, which would lead to significant declines in retail trade. People would avoid public places, such as shopping malls, community centers, places of worship, and public transit. Attendance at theaters, sporting events, museums, and restaurants would decline. It seems likely that many schools would close, and even if they did not, attendance would fall dramatically as parents kept their children at home.

I do not think it should be the vice president. The vice president has a full-time job. Getting ready for and responding to pandemic threats is also a full-time job. And the idea the vice president would do it in his spare time, doesn’t seem like a good idea to me. President Obama after he brought me in to do the Ebola response—when I left, we were getting close to zero cases—appointed a senior member of the National Security Council staff to be in charge of pandemic response, and President Trump continued that for the first year of his presidency.

Over the past quarter century, warnings have been clear and consistent from both US government leaders, scientists, and global health officials: A pandemic was coming—and whenever it arrived, it would be catastrophic to the global economy. In recent years red alerts have come almost monthly—sometimes weekly—and all three of Trump’s predecessors have dedicated significant personal time and public attention to the pandemic threat.\n\nThe most recent warning, a [bipartisan report](https:\u002F\u002Fhealthsecurity.csis.org\u002Ffinal-report\u002F) by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cochaired by former US senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, and Julie Gerberding, George W. Bush’s one-time director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was published on November 18, 2019—one day after we now know that the first case of the novel coronavirus that would be later be named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China's Hubei Province. That report’s number-one recommendation was to undo the Trump administration’s cuts to pandemic planning: “Restore health security leadership at the White House National Security Council.”\n\nA careful review of past reports, books, planning documents, Congressional hearings, op-eds, speeches, and public testimonies make clear that all the problems of the current Covid-19 crisis were foreseen over the past 15 years, as officials and leaders like Bill Gates warned in increasingly dire terms about the government’s lack of sufficient preparation.\n\nAs early as 2005, President Bush [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2005\u002F11\u002F02\u002Fpolitics\u002Fbush-announces-plan-to-prepare-for-flu-epidemic.html), “Our country has been given fair warning of this danger to our homeland.” Eight years ago, a report by the US Department of Health and Human Services cited the need to develop “social distancing” models to inform how we combat the spread of a pandemic; it also pointed to potentially dangerous shortfalls in ventilator stockpiles and noted that there were local shortages of masks during the H1N1 pandemic, though these were filled by the national stockpile equipment. Repeated public warnings came even from those on the front line of today’s response, including Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar and Anthony Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDespite substantial progress during the Obama administration—which grappled with the H1N1 scare and the 2014 Ebola outbreak and was so concerned about the threat of a pandemic that it even highlighted the threat in a [tabletop exercise](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.politico.com\u002Fnews\u002F2020\u002F03\u002F16\u002Ftrump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797) with incoming officials during the transition—the Trump administration let pandemic planning efforts lapse.\n\nThat trend, too, was clear early. As early as seven weeks into the Trump administration, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were raising concerns that the Trump administration was undermining pandemic preparedness efforts. As she and four other members of Congress [wrote](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.warren.senate.gov\u002Ffiles\u002Fdocuments\u002F2017_3_13_Letter_to_CDC.pdf) then to Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, “Actions taken by President Trump could also impair our readiness in the face of a public health crisis, such as a flu pandemic.”\n\nThe truth is, it isn’t just the Trump administration that failed to sufficiently heed the tsunami of warnings. Leaders in state and local government, industry, and multinational institutions—all of whom share the responsibility to be prepared—were equally on notice that a pandemic was coming. But in the United States, we look to the federal government to lead the efforts on problems too big and too complex for any one jurisdiction or company.\n\nThe following oral history of public pandemic warnings has been compiled from government and other official reports, medical journals, videos, books, op-eds, congressional hearings, news articles, statements, and other public records. None of the following quotations are backward-looking “I told you so’s”; all are contemporaneous, forward-looking warnings and predictions.

Yet in one vital area, the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases, we can already predict the future—and it is threatening and dangerous to us all.\n\n**[White House Press Release](https:\u002F\u002Ffas.org\u002Firp\u002Foffdocs\u002Fpdd_ntsc7.htm)**, *June 12, 1996*: Calling emerging infectious diseases a growing global health threat, Vice President Gore today announced President Clinton’s new policy to establish a worldwide infectious disease surveillance and response system and expand certain federal agency mandates to better protect American citizens. “Emerging infectious diseases present one of the most significant health and security challenges facing the global community,” Vice President Gore said during remarks to the annual meeting of the National Council for International Health in Crystal City, Virginia. “Through President Clinton’s leadership, we now have the first national policy to deal with this serious international problem.”\n\n### II. The Bush Era\n**Gardiner Harris,** *“[From Washington, a Story About a Killer Flu](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2005\u002F10\u002F16\u002Fweekinreview\u002Ffrom-washington-a-story-about-a-killer-flu.html),” The New York Times, October 16, 2005*: This week, the Bush administration is expected to release its pandemic flu plan, which could generate its own movie epic. The *Times* obtained a draft of the plan, dated September 30. No one would confuse the 381-page document with a screenplay, but pages 45 through 47, the section titled “Pandemic Scenario—Origin and Initial Spread,” are gripping. They describe a flu epidemic moving from a village in Asia to the United States, where it causes panic and as many as 1.9 million deaths.\n\n**Excerpt, “Pandemic Scenario—Origin and Initial Spread,” White House planning scenario:** During the peak of disease activity in the community, police, fire and transportation services are limited by personnel shortages, and absenteeism at utility companies leads to spot power outages. Supplies of food, fuel, and medical supplies are disrupted as truck drivers become ill or stay home from work. In some areas, grocery store shelves are empty and social unrest occurs. Long lines form where food and gasoline are available. Elderly patients with chronic, unstable medical conditions hesitate to leave their homes for fear of becoming seriously ill with influenza. Riots occur at some vaccination clinics as people are turned away or supplies run out. Several trucks transporting vaccine are hijacked, and a gray market develops for vaccine and antiviral drugs—many of which are counterfeit … Family members are distraught and outraged when loved ones die within a matter of a few days. Public anxiety heightens mistrust of government, diminishing compliance with public health advisories. “Worried well” seek medical care despite their absence of influenza illness, further burdening the health care system. Mortuaries and funeral homes are overwhelmed.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n#### SIGN UP TODAY\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5be5e669a2e9765d4710ab4c]\n\n##### Sign up for the [Backchannel newsletter](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fnewsletter\u002F?name=backchannel&sourceCode=CarveLeft2) and never miss the best of WIRED.\n+++\n\n**President George W.

Most of us are accustomed to seasonal influenza, or “the flu,” a viral infection that continues to be a significant public health challenge. From time to time, changes in the influenza virus result in a new strain to which people have never been exposed … Although the timing cannot be predicted, history and science suggest that we will face one or more pandemics in this century.\n\nThe next pandemic is likely to come in waves, each lasting months, and pass through communities of all sizes across the nation and world. While a pandemic will not damage power lines, banks or computer networks, it will ultimately threaten all critical infrastructure by removing essential personnel from the workplace for weeks or months.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** *Secretary of Health and Human Services, “[HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fflu\u002Fpdf\u002Fprofessionals\u002Fhhspandemicinfluenzaplan.pdf),” November 2005*: One of the most important public health issues our nation and the world faces is the threat of a global disease outbreak called a pandemic. No one in the world today is fully prepared for a pandemic—but we are better prepared today than we were yesterday—and we will be better prepared tomorrow than we are today … History teaches us that everything we do today to prepare for that eventuality will have many lasting benefits for the future. We will realize important advances in health care, and we will be better prepared for other types of emergencies. I am humbled by the enormity of the challenge that the global community confronts should there be a pandemic. Public cooperation and global partnerships will be essential tools in fighting back and creating a constant state of readiness. If together we take the steps necessary, we will be able to save the lives of millions of people in our country and all around the world.\n\n**Excerpt, Congressional Budget Office, “**[A Potential Influenza Pandemic: Possible Macroeconomic Effects and Policy Issues](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cbo.gov\u002Fsites\u002Fdefault\u002Ffiles\u002Fcbofiles\u002Fftpdocs\u002F69xx\u002Fdoc6946\u002F12-08-birdflu.pdf)**,”** _December 8, 2005,  revised July 27, 2006_**:** During a severe pandemic, hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices would probably be overwhelmed, and surveillance (keeping track of where the disease was and where it was going) would be difficult. Health care workers would be exposed to the disease, resulting in further strains on the health care system’s capacity, as some workers became sick and others stayed home to care for family members or to avoid becoming ill. Care for non-acute health problems would be sharply curtailed.\n\nAs the pandemic progressed, international travel would dramatically decline, as people avoided avian flu “hot spots” and governments restricted travel. It seems unlikely that domestic and international air travel would cease completely, but as a point of reference, at the peak of the SARS outbreak in April 2003, airline passenger arrivals in Hong Kong had declined by nearly two-thirds relative to their levels in March. In all likelihood, people would quarantine themselves and their families by staying at home more. Nonessential activities that required social contact would be sharply cut, which would lead to significant declines in retail trade. People would avoid public places, such as shopping malls, community centers, places of worship, and public transit. Attendance at theaters, sporting events, museums, and restaurants would decline. It seems likely that many schools would close, and even if they did not, attendance would fall dramatically as parents kept their children at home. In either event, large-scale school closings would lead to a spike in workplace absences because parents would stay home to care for their children even if they were not sick.\n\n**Homeland Security Council, [](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fflu\u002Fpandemic-resources\u002Fpdf\u002Fpandemic-influenza-implementation.pdf)**[National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fflu\u002Fpandemic-resources\u002Fpdf\u002Fpandemic-influenza-implementation.pdf)\\*\\*, *May 2006:* History suggests … another novel influenza virus will emerge at some point in the future and threaten an unprotected human population. The economic and societal disruption of an influenza pandemic could be significant. Absenteeism across multiple sectors related to personal illness, illness in family members, fear of contagion, or public health measures to limit contact with others could threaten the functioning of critical infrastructure, the movement of goods and services, and operation of institutions such as schools and universities. A pandemic would thus have significant implications for the economy, national security, and the basic functioning of society.\n\nUnlike geographically and temporally bounded disasters, a pandemic will spread across the globe over the course of months or over a year, possibly in waves, and will affect communities of all sizes and compositions. In terms of its scope, the impact of a severe pandemic may be more comparable to that of war or a widespread economic crisis than a hurricane, earthquake, or act of terrorism … Preparedness for a pandemic requires the establishment of infrastructure and capacity, a process that can take years.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** _Secretary of Health and Human Services, [Pandemic Planning Update II](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fflu\u002Fpandemic-resources\u002Fpdf\u002Fpanflureport3.pdf), November 13, 2006_**:** A year ago, few Americans had heard of avian flu. Today, awareness is high. There has been a deluge of news reports, and we’ve had not one, but two made-for-TV bird flu movies. This past year, a nearly forgotten word, pandemic, reentered our vocabulary. And then the media moved on. There is a danger that as avian flu slips from the headlines, people will believe the threat is no longer real.\n\n**Michael O. Leavitt,** _[Pandemic Planning Update VI](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fflu\u002Fpandemic-resources\u002Fpdf\u002Fpanflureport6.pdf), January 8, 2009_**:** The history of pandemics is not so much the history of health as it is the history of humanity. When pandemics strike, they cause massive sickness and terrible loss of life. They even reshape nations … Today, many people mistakenly think influenza pandemics are a thing of the past, but influenza has struck hard in the era of modern medicine—much harder than most people realize. And it will strike again. Pandemics are hard things to talk about. When one discusses them in advance, it sounds alarmist. After a pandemic starts, no matter how much preparation has been done, it will be inadequate … I believe we can prepare successfully for a pandemic. But it will require determination. It will require change.\n\n### III. The Obama Era\n**Dennis C.

The World Bank estimates that if the next pandemic virus is similar to the one that caused the 1918 pandemic, it could kill 71 million people worldwide and cause a major global recession with global costs exceeding $3 trillion.\n\n**Dennis C.

It also highlights many of the United States’ critical dependencies and vulnerabilities in the health arena. But like an iceberg, the visible portion is just a small fraction of the myriad of health issues that will likely challenge the United States in the coming years. Significant gaps remain in disease surveillance and reporting that undermine our ability to confront disease outbreaks overseas or identify contaminated products before they threaten Americans.\n\n**Kathleen Sebelius,** *Secretary of Health and Human Services, [2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf), May 29, 2012*: In the approximately three years since the start of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has continued our efforts to improve the nation’s readiness for a future influenza pandemic. It is essential that these efforts continue since influenza viruses with pandemic potential continue to spread widely in animals and sporadically infect humans, and the place and time of the next pandemic cannot be anticipated. Prior pandemic preparedness efforts and investments provided the groundwork for the 2009 H1N1 response; now those preparedness strategies and plans need to be adjusted to incorporate real world experiences and recent technological advances.\n\n**Executive Summary, [](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**[2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**, HHS, 2012:** The 2009 H1N1 pandemic arose against a backdrop of five years of pandemic planning efforts—including efforts on the part of the United States and the international community as a whole—to develop, refine, and regularly exercise pandemic plans at national, state, and local levels, and to engage the private sector and nonprofit partners … A severe influenza pandemic can affect society well beyond just the health and medical sectors. Potentially high rates of illness (25 - 30 percent of the US population) and death could affect critical infrastructure, private-sector activities, educational institutions, and the movement of goods and services across the nation and the globe—resulting in significant economic and security consequences. Workplace absences due to high rates of illness and death among not only those who are sick, but also among caretakers of the ill, could have a significant impact on employers and the economy. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the immediate disruptions from a severe pandemic could cause a 4.25 percent reduction in the nation’s Gross Domestic Product.\n\n**Summary of Key Priorities, [](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**[2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf), **HHS, 2012:** Enhance understanding of the benefits and societal costs of social distancing measures … Promote the development of healthcare coalitions and other collaborative regional planning entities at the sub-state\u002Fregional levels, and integrated medical care surge plans … Reassess the quantity and composition of ventilators that should be stockpiled by various levels of government and other partners for pandemic influenza and other threats … Reassess strategies for distributing ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile to the states, to help ensure federal assets will be used equitably across the US.\n\n**Excerpt, [](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**[2009 H1N1 Influenza Improvement Plan](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.phe.gov\u002FPreparedness\u002Fmcm\u002Fh1n1-retrospective\u002FDocuments\u002F2009-h1n1-improvementplan.pdf)**:** Mechanical ventilators serve an essential role in managing respiratory failure from severe respiratory illnesses, including influenza … Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is also characteristic of many other diseases and conditions that could manifest in a mass casualty event. As such, the HHS maintains ventilators in the strategic national stockpile for a future pandemic or other public health emergency to augment state and local needs …  Results of a survey conducted in the summer of 2009 showed great geographic variation in the nation’s population-adjusted ventilator supply and revealed that the nation’s supply is higher per capita than any other developed country, albeit significantly lower than the current estimated need during a severe pandemic … If a large proportion of the US population were to become severely ill during a pandemic and required mechanical ventilation, the health care system would quickly become overwhelmed.\n\n**James R.

The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. Its entire budget for influenza was just $7.7 million in 2013—less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies. It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever.

A more crowded and interconnected world is increasing the opportunities for human and animal diseases to emerge and spread globally … The world’s population remains vulnerable to infectious diseases because anticipating which pathogen might spread from animals to humans or if a human virus will take a more virulent form is nearly impossible. For example, if a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus like H7N9 were to become easily transmissible among humans, the outcome could be far more disruptive than the great influenza pandemic of 1918. It could lead to global economic losses, the unseating of governments, and disturbance of geopolitical alliances.\n\n**Bill Gates,** _Gates Foundation cofounder, “[We’re not ready for the next epidemic](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.gatesnotes.com\u002FHealth\u002FWe-Are-Not-Ready-for-the-Next-Epidemic),” blog post, March 18, 2015_**:** The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a tragedy—as I write this, more than 10,000 people have died.

With so much money and energy being devoted to combatting large-scale terrorist attacks, nuclear proliferation, and other dangers, why has so much less attention been devoted to a threat that is arguably more likely and potentially deadlier? … The past two decades have seen a roll call of near-miss catastrophes.\n\nNew political and social trends further increase our risk level … The ability of social media to rapidly spread false information—painfully illustrated in the 2016 campaign—is another source of danger: Would the directives of public health officials be followed in a crisis? Would they be undermined by misinformation spread by misguided provocateurs or a hostile foreign power? And then there is the risk factor of isolationism and xenophobia. While responsible officials in the Trump administration have responded to two Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo this year…in a more visible crisis, Trump’s isolationist instincts might assert themselves … No city in America has existing capacity (i.e., treatment units within a hospital supported by trained staff and equipment) to treat more than a handful of dangerous infectious diseases patients at one time … An outbreak of even just a few dozen cases of a deadly, highly infectious disease—let alone a few hundred—would overwhelm any city in our country. In such a scenario, death would beget death, as patients carrying the virus would stream into hospitals and infect others who did not yet have the disease … We need to step up our investment in facilities, training, and equipment for our domestic epidemic response—and do so now, not when a crisis comes.\n\n**Bill Gates,** _“[What I learned at work this year](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.gatesnotes.com\u002FAbout-Bill-Gates\u002FYear-in-Review-2018),” December 29, 2018_**:** I had hoped that hitting the 100th anniversary of this epidemic would spark a lot of discussion about whether we’re ready for the next global epidemic. Unfortunately, it didn’t, and we still are not ready … If anything is going to kill tens of millions of people in a short time, it will probably be a global epidemic. And the disease would most likely be a form of the flu, because the flu virus spreads easily through the air … To be prepared, we need a plan for national governments to work together. We need to think through how to handle quarantines, make sure supply chains will reach affected areas, decide how to involve the military, and so on. There was not much progress on these questions in 2018.\n\n**Alex Azar,** _Health and Human Services Secretary, [National Biodefense Summit](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.hhs.gov\u002Fabout\u002Fleadership\u002Fsecretary\u002Fspeeches\u002F2019-speeches\u002Fremarks-to-the-national-biodefense-summit.html), April 17, 2019_**:** The thing that people often ask is: “What keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world?” Pandemic flu, of course.\n\n**William Brangham and Judy Woodruff**_, “[Why another flu pandemic is likely just a matter of when](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pbs.org\u002Fnewshour\u002Fshow\u002Fwhy-another-flu-pandemic-is-likely-just-a-matter-of-when),” PBS Newshour, June 18, 2019_:  Judy Woodruff: Public health officials fear the emergence of a new, previously unknown flu virus that could be far more lethal and become a pandemic by spreading across the world … William Brangham: [Dr. Anthony] Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. He says while many take the so-called seasonal flu for granted, it still kills tens of thousands in the US every year. But the seasonal flu isn’t really what Fauci loses sleep over. It’s the concern that a new flu strain emerges, a virus we have never seen before and have no protections against, like what happened in 1918.\n\n**Susan Brooks,** _US Representative, Republican, Indiana’s fifth district, [PBS Newshour](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pbs.org\u002Fnewshour\u002Fshow\u002Fwhy-another-flu-pandemic-is-likely-just-a-matter-of-when), June 18, 2019_**:** We have not given [a pandemic] all of the attention that it deserves. Every time you do an exercise, you realize where the gaps are. If large numbers of people begin to get sick, actually, your economy is impacted, our national security can be impacted. There are so many things that people just don’t realize. These are the types of things that most citizens don’t think about. We don’t want to think about them.

I do not think it should be the vice president. The vice president has a full-time job. Getting ready for and responding to pandemic threats is also a full-time job. And the idea the vice president would do it in his spare time, doesn’t seem like a good idea to me. President Obama after he brought me in to do the Ebola response—when I left, we were getting close to zero cases—appointed a senior member of the National Security Council staff to be in charge of pandemic response, and President Trump continued that for the first year of his presidency. That position has been terminated.

The United States must either pay now and gain protection and security or wait for the next epidemic and pay a much greater price in human and economic costs.
