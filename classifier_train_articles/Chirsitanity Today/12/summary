However, despite all the disruption and our inability to worship together as usual, I believe the pandemic lockdown is being used by God to use his church in a new way.
Churches have begun to overlook their historical denominational divisions, bringing the Indian church to the cusp of revival.
Following the lockdown, churches began scrambling to put plans together.
For example: I know a local church community in rural North India that has been struggling even in the best of times.
What the police did not know was that this church community had been praying for ways to respond during the lockdown.
