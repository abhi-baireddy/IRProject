When I hit a desert season in my spiritual life some years ago, I felt haunted by the abundance I had left behind.
As I look back on those desert years, I see that hard-won truth for what it is—a Lenten lesson.
Although we often think of Lent as a time of strict discipline and self-denial, it requires something much more: a deep understanding of our belovedness.
In the story of his encounter with Satan in the desert, we often think Jesus had victory over temptation simply because of his divinity.
They believed the secret to Jesus’ strength in the desert came from the event right before: his baptism in the Jordan River.
