Masturbation doesn't fit within typical modern ethical concerns.
There are no peer-reviewed studies linking it to obesity or reduced charitable giving, and it is virtually the only thing on earth that doesn't give you cancer.
So the question for Christian ethics is not, “Is masturbation sinful?” It's, “What could possibly be wrong with it?”Now, this is the best-case scenario we tend to believe about masturbation, though many times the habit becomes compulsive and tied up into the exploitative porn industry—which are compounding issues on their own.
But for masturbation itself?
The other perspective comes out of my faith as a Roman Catholic.
