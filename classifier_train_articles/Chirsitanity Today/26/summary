There are four passages in Isaiah often called the Songs of the Suffering Servant.
Even as he is a Suffering Servant, he calls his church to be a fellowship of suffering servants.
That the kingdom of God is not about power and triumph, because all the might of the world cannot heal the hearts of men.
That itâ€™s about becoming a suffering servant like him, joining him in the work of making all things new, and bringing healing into the broken places.
The cross is an object for contemplation, but also an invitation: Go and do likewise.
