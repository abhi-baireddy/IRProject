Once my husband, Bill, left for work, I packed a bag for myself and our 14-month-old son and left our home.
A washcloth and cup of coffee later, Mom told me she and Dad would help me.
She told me to list in the left column all the things Bill did that made him impossible to live with.
As I looked at the dividing line, I thought she'd then tell me to list all his good qualities on the right hand side.
I was determined to have a longer list of bad qualities on the left.
