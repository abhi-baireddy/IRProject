(RNS) — Willow Creek Community Church announced this evening that David Dummitt, a megachurch pastor from Michigan, will be the church’s new senior pastor.
Willow Creek has eight campuses in and around Chicago and in the past has reported more than 25,000 attenders.
A graduate of Wheaton College who attended Asbury Seminary, Dummitt said in a statement he has long admired the work of Willow Creek.
He called himself a “church kid who played in the handbell choir” while growing up and that Willow Creek taught him church could be different.
Willow Creek’s founding pastor, Hybels, was known for his high-intensity personality and his admiration for corporate culture and business practices.
