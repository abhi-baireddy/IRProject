With that in mind, Iâ€™ve put together a list of 20 prayers to pray during this pandemic.
For our local, state, and federal governments: God, help our elected officials as they allocate the necessary resources for combatting this pandemic.
For the media, committed to providing up-to-date information: God, help them to communicate with appropriate seriousness without causing panic.
For parents who cannot stay home from work but must find care for their children: God, present them with creative solutions.
God, help Christians in health care to exhibit extraordinary peace, so that many would ask about the reason for their hope.
