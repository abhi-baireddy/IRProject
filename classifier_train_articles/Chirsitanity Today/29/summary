After studying the Bible, she has come to the conclusion that she divorced for selfish reasons, not biblical ones.
Explicit Divorce AllowancesThe Bible only explicitly allows divorce for two reasons.
He says, “If a husband is beating his wife, that would certainly seem to be to violate the ‘one flesh’ union.
She says, “In Matthew 19:9, Jesus forbids divorce ‘except for unchastity.’” She explains, “When a spouse breaks the marriage covenant through sexual sin—porneia—there are biblical grounds for divorce.
Porneia certainly includes adultery, because adultery violates the one flesh union.
