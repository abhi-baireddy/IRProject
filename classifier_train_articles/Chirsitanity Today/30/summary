A global pandemic calls God’s church to prayer.
On Sunday, March 15, a National Day of Prayer was held regarding the ongoing pandemic that we currently face in our nation.
Over the next four articles I want to highlight features about prayer that we see in the Acts.
Acts 1:14 tells us “All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer.” Following the Lord’s instruction after his resurrection to his followers, these believers gathered for prayer.
Just as in the early church in the Book of Acts, we went to the Lord in prayer.
