Our first recourse—just like the first believers—is to turn to the Lord in prayer.
The second thing we can see from the church’s prayer in Acts speaks directly to where we are today: The church turned first to prayer in times of difficulty.
We read beginning in verse 23 the first corporate prayer recorded in Acts, and it’s in response to difficulty.
Our sure source of help in times of difficulty is prayer and the Holy Spirit will work mightily in and through our prayers.
