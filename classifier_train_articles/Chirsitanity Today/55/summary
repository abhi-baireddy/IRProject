Sunday night, Jason Aldean was performing at an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas when an assailant opened fire from a hotel window 32 stories above.
In the past few days, media pundits and others have tried to unpack the role of country music in the attack.
But as an avid country music fan, I’m inclined to think about the genre itself and how country music gives us a script for understanding grief, healing, and human sin.
As I’ve noted before, the past few years have seen significant change in country music.
At bottom, this is what gives country music (and the community around it) its stubbornness, its grit, its strength, and its resilience.
