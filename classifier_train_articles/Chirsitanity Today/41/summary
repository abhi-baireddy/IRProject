Three months after firing founding pastor James MacDonald, Harvest Bible Chapel has pulled the video and radio broadcasts of his popular “Walk in the Word” teaching ministry and announced that it will not move forward with plans for digital distributions of his sermons.
After 21 years as a radio ministry, Harvest decided last year that Walk in the Word—which reportedly reached 5 million people a month—would be moving to digital distribution, but those plans have also been canceled.
In Thursday’s letter, Harvest wrote, “Walk in the Word is a ministry of Harvest Bible Chapel.”The church also stated it stopped accepting contributions for Walk in the World on March 1.
The teaching ministry brought in $8.1 million in the US and $380,000 in Canada last year, according to its 2018 fiscal year report.
Blogger and former Moody Radio host Julie Roys wrote about the Walk in the Word cancellation on Thursday evening, noting that 2,000 stations had aired the show in 2018.
