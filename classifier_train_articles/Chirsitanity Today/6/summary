But now, most of us in America live rather ordinary lives in the suburbs.
No longer is the suburb’s only narrative that of rich, white men commuting out of suburbia into large cities for work.
Through small acts like these of connecting and paying attention to our neighbors’ lives, we begin to share the gospel.
Speaking and ServingHow do we make room for people and invite them to consider Jesus through the means of ordinary hospitality?
Your real life in the place you live is the holy and ordinary ground upon which you live out your faith.
