This year, my teenage son overstepped boundaries while texting a girl his age.
He didn’t send anything inappropriate, per se: when I read the texts myself, they seemed a rather banal sequence of “hey there” and “how r u?” messages, interspersed with nonsensical emojis.
This incident might have seemed harmless, just two eighth graders learning to navigate electronic communication.
As he matures and begins dating, I wanted him to know that no always means no, even when the interaction seems relatively benign.
I have become finely attuned to the issue of consent lately, in some part because my boys are too quickly turning into men.
