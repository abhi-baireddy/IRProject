Two Muslim women boarding a plane in Manchester, England, last week became trailblazers in the debate over full-body scanners by refusing to undergo the scan, citing religious and medical restrictions.
Muslim scholars in the U.S. have already issued a fatwa against full-body scans as a violation of Islamic teaching on modesty.
More airports worldwide are installing full-body scanners after the Christmas Day bombing attempt by a Muslim Nigerian carrying explosives in his underwear on a Detroit-bound flight.
The first round of 150 full-body scanners slated for major U.S. airports are being installed today in Boston's Logan International Airport.
The Times (UK) reports that full-body scans give security staff detailed images of passengers' nude bodies, which human rights groups decry as a "virtual strip search."
