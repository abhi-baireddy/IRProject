Google is reportedly testing its own Google-branded smart debit card that will help customers make and track purchases made online and in stores, according to a report from TechCrunch.
Unlike Apple’s own Apple Card — which is a full-blown credit card — the Google project is said to be a debit card, with partners like Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union (the card itself is a Visa card, although Google may expand that to other payment processors like Mastercard, too.)
But much like the Apple Card, the Google debit card is designed to work as a physical card and a tap-to-pay digital card on a phone, and it will offer a separate virtual card number for use with online retailers.
Right now, though, Google’s debit card appears to just be a more convenient (and potentially) more secure face on existing debit card options from banks.
TechCrunch’s report also doesn’t mention when it plans to launch the debit card or if the test will ever get a full consumer release.
