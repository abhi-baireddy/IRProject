There have been rumors and leaks aplenty about the Google Pixel 4A, but they’re starting to bubble up even more today.
9to5Google published what it claims is a complete set of specs for the Pixel 4A, and most intriguing of all, it says that Google won’t be releasing a Pixel 4A XL.
The Pixel 4A will instead split the difference in size between the prior models, with a 5.8-inch display that’s a little larger than the 5.6-inch Pixel 3A but slightly smaller than the 6-inch Pixel 3A XL.
According to 9to5Google’s reporting, the Pixel 4A will have an OLED screen like the Pixel 3A, which is still a rarity among other semi-affordable phones.
A new photo from TechDroider’s Twitter post (via Android Central) shows off what is allegedly the Google Pixel 4A retail box.
