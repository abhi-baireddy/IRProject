You can outfit the V60 with a second display (with the optional Dual Screen case) for unrivaled multitasking.
Pricing is a little scattered, with the phone itself costing $800 (T-Mobile) or around $900 with the Dual Screen on Verizon and AT&T.
The V60 just does so much (doubly so if you get it with the Dual Screen) that, in a vacuum, it’s hard not to be impressed.
The most common use case for the Dual Screen is the simplest: two apps at once.
But remember that you can always just detach the chunky, heavy Dual Screen case when you don’t need those multitasking powers.
