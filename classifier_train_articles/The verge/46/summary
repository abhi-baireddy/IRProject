That’s the major common thread connecting outbreaks from the Black Death to the current novel coronavirus outbreak: fear and panic can magnify the harm done by a virus.
That let the disease spread among families, which made the outbreak harder to contain.
In Iran, fake letters from health officials spread on social media, and bad information on the best ways to prevent infection from the virus circulated online.
That cycle may lead people to disregard public health advice and continue to, for example, buy and hoard masks or to ignore recommendations around isolation and quarantine.
During a disease outbreak, anxiety and worry are reasonable reactions, and it’s important to take precautions to reduce the spread of disease.
