Most Zoom meetings have a public link that, if clicked, allow anyone to join.
Trolls have been collecting these links and sharing them in private chat groups, and then signing on to other people’s calls to cause mischief.
There’s an easy way to stop this from happening, but Zoom makes it needlessly difficult to find.
If you schedule a meeting from the web interface, you won’t see the option to disable screen sharing.
If you’re using an Android phone, find “Lock Share” and switch the toggle on.
