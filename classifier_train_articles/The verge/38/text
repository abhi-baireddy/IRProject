Whether you’re looking for a capable action cam for outdoor use or want to upgrade your vlog setup, GoPro’s Hero 8 Black is a recommended option. It’s especially worth considering today as its cost has been cut to $299, which is the lowest price we’ve seen for this model by a wide margin. It’s usually $399 for the camera, and both B&H Photo and Adorama are honoring this deal.

The Hero 8 Black is GoPro’s latest camera, and the HyperSmooth 2.0 electronic image stabilization is probably where you’ll see the biggest improvement over the previous model. You’ll get smooth-looking footage in rough conditions where you’d think the results might look choppy. The footage will also look great, too, as this model supports 1080p resolution at 240 frames per second slow-motion and 4K resolution at 60 frames per second.
