Whether you’re looking for a capable action cam for outdoor use or want to upgrade your vlog setup, GoPro’s Hero 8 Black is a recommended option.
It’s usually $399 for the camera, and both B&H Photo and Adorama are honoring this deal.
The Hero 8 Black is GoPro’s latest camera, and the HyperSmooth 2.0 electronic image stabilization is probably where you’ll see the biggest improvement over the previous model.
