Being able to stay in touch while social distancing is really important, which is why we’ve come to rely on apps that help you make group calls.
On WhatsApp, you can do an audio-only or video group call with up to four people.
One of the drawbacks of group calls on WhatsApp is that you can’t switch a group call between audio-only and video once you start the call.
While the interface looks a little different on Android than it does on iOS, the basic steps for making group calls are the same.
