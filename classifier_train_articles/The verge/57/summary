In his post, Zuckerberg says private, encrypted messaging tools will also create room for new business tools — especially ones around payments and commerce, the company’s current pet obsessions.
The services will eventually become “a platform for many other kinds of private services,” he writes.
In addition to making messaging more private, Zuckerberg also plans to make messaging interoperable.
That will start by allowing you to message between Facebook services, but Facebook eventually wants to make Instagram Direct, WhatsApp, and Messenger interoperable with SMS.
Of course, it’s one thing to promise a newer, more private Facebook — and another thing to deliver it.
