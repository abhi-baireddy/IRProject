Food delivery platform Postmates is starting what the company is calling a “non-contact delivery” initiative designed to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus when its contract workers are delivering ordered meals and other goods.
Postmates doing "non-contact deliveries."
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Ele.me subsidiary and and food delivery platform Meituan Dianping, both of which dominate the Chinese food delivery market, have implemented similar non-contact delivery options amid the coronavirus outbreak in the country, Bloomberg reports.
That’s involved secure drop off and pickup locations to avoid putting delivery workers and customers in direct physical contact.
Both are also asking delivery workers — many of which use bicycles, motorcycles, and scooters — to wear masks, too.
