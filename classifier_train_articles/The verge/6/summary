Microsoft is currently building a new Spotlight-like launcher app for Windows 10.
An early version of the launcher will support basic search tasks that are typically handled by the built-in Windows Start menu search functionality.
For most Windows users the Start menu search will be enough, as it acts as a basic launcher of sorts.
The current Win + R functionality is outdated and used by Windows power users to launch cmd prompts, regedit, powershell instances, and even shortcuts to areas in Windows like the Control Panel.
This new launcher will support all of the same commands that Run does currently in Windows, but the hope is that it will be a powerful alternative that the community of Windows power users can build on.
