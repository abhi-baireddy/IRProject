A security lapse at controversial facial recognition startup Clearview AI meant that its source code, some of its secret keys and cloud storage credentials, and even copies of its apps were publicly accessible.
Hussein was able to take screenshots of the company’s iOS app, which Apple recently blocked for violating its rules.
Hussein also said he found around 70,000 videos in the company’s cloud storage taken from a camera installed in a residential building.
Clearview AI’s founder Hoan Ton-That told TechCrunch that the footage had been captured with the permission of the building’s management as part of attempts to prototype a security camera.
Clearview AI’s system has faced fierce criticism from tech firms as well as US authorities after it became public.
