With all this extra attention, Zoom is now facing a huge privacy and security backlash as security experts, privacy advocates, lawmakers, and even the FBI warn that Zoom’s default settings aren’t secure enough.
Zoom has battled security and privacy concerns before.
Zoom adjusted these default settings for education accounts last week, “in an effort to increase security and privacy for meetings.” For everyone else, you’ll need to tweak your Zoom settings to ensure this never happens.
Zoombombing was the first of many recent Zoom security and privacy concerns, though.
The company now faces some tough decisions on how to better balance its default settings, user privacy, and ultimately its ease of use.
