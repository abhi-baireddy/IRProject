Instacart is also letting all of its in-store shoppers nationally accrue sick pay, and that includes part-time employees.
Instacart shoppers can earn one hour of sick pay for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours per year.
Sick pay accrual will be backdated to the start of this year.
Grubhub hasn’t replied to a request for comment asking if it plans to pay workers who have to miss work due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
On Friday, Instacart also rolled out a new “Leave at My Door Delivery” option across North America.
