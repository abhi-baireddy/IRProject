Amazon is looking to hire 100,000 new warehouse and delivery workers to meet increased demands for shipments as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the company announced on Monday.
It will also increase the hourly pay of workers employed in these positions by an additional $2 in the United States through April.
As more Americans stay indoors to protect themselves from the coronavirus outbreak, they’re turning to e-commerce stores like Amazon to purchase groceries and household supplies.

Amazon is looking to bring those people into their warehouses, Clark said in his statement.
