You can use Slack for whatever you’d like — keeping up with friends, sharing recipes, organizing activities, and so on.
Although Slack is largely intended for group collaboration, it also has tools if you just want to chat one-on-one with people.
Then select “Go.” Type your message in the box at the bottom and press enter / return to send.
Enter in the name of the person you want to send a message to in the bar at the top.
