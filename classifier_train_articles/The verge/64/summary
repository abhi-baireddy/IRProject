Use the app’s sliders to select the moment in the footage that you want to GIF — this part’s a little annoying if you’re looking to GIF something very short.
(This is also another useful tool for making GIFs from YouTube videos, with similar limitations to those I mentioned above re: Giphy Capture.)
If you’re making GIFs for a professional reason, I assume you can submit this as a work expense.
The most useful option in GIF Brewery’s GIF Properties is “Reduce number of colors in GIF.” It’s useful if you don’t want to mess around in Photoshop simplifying colors, and if you’re trying to get a GIF down under Tumblr’s sort of Draconian 2MB limit.
Like Boomerang, VSCO’s GIF app has a basic roster of filters and records only very short blips of video (2.5 seconds).
