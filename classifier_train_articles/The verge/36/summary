A new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China at the start of December, and has infected tens of thousands of people in dozens of countries.
The World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency over the outbreak.
Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
The new coronavirus appears to cause symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and other respiratory symptoms.
Public health officials are working to understand how dangerous this virus is, how fast itâ€™s spreading, and how to contain it.
