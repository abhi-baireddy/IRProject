A new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China at the start of December, and has infected tens of thousands of people in dozens of countries. The World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency over the outbreak.

Coronaviruses are common in many types of animals, and can sometimes jump to humans. In this case, the virus probably came from a bat. Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively. This time, scientists were able to quickly sequence the virus and develop a diagnostic test.

The new coronavirus appears to cause symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and other respiratory symptoms. It appears to cause severe illness in around a quarter of cases, and can be deadly. Public health officials are working to understand how dangerous this virus is, how fast itâ€™s spreading, and how to contain it. As that work continues, the virus is causing anxiety around the world.
