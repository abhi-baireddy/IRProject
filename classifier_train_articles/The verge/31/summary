But those kinds of speeds come at a big cost: you’ll have to use OnePlus’ special Warp Charge 30 chargers, which cost $69.95 and $79.95 for the pad and stand versions, respectively.
OnePlus does note that there’s a “sleep mode” for charging overnight that disables the fan at the cost of faster charging speeds.
The charger also doesn’t feature some of the conveniences most modern wireless chargers offer, like removable plugs or standardized USB-C cables.
But for all of that, OnePlus is making some big promises about charging speeds, with the aforementioned half-charge of the battery in a half-hour at up to 30W.
In other words, unless you have a OnePlus phone with wireless Warp Charge, you’ll probably want to steer clear.
