Even if you don’t think you spit when you talk, you definitely do — and a new video highlights that spit with lasers.
The video, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed how the spurts of particles released when someone said “stay healthy” at various volumes.
Huffman was not involved in the video, but he says this demonstration with the technique is a useful way to show that just talking can still send spit flying.
People also produce particles a lot smaller than that when they talk and breathe, and smaller particles can still carry microscopic bugs, including the novel coronavirus.
Demonstrations that don’t include the full range of what someone might spray out when they talk are still useful, Huffman says.
