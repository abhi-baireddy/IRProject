The best value to take advantage of today is the Nintendo Labo Variety Kit.
To name a few examples of some of the kits included, there’s a piano, a fishing reel, and a motorcycle.
The Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit is also included in today’s deal, and it contains three projects to build: an all-terrain vehicle, an airplane, and a submarine-like underwater vehicle.
If you want to build a giant robot, you’ll probably have some fun with the Nintendo Labo Robot Kit.
Lastly, the Labo VR Kit turns your Switch into a VR headset of sorts that you can peer into.
