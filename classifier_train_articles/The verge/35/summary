Google’s Nest Wifi mesh routers and extenders have been discounted plenty of times since they launched last year, but Bed Bath & Beyond (originally via Slickdeals) might have the best deal yet.
It’s offering a deal on a bundle that contains one Nest Wifi router and one Nest Wifi point.
A Nest Wifi router has two gigabit Ethernet ports, but its “points,” as they’re called, are basically extenders that help to cover more of your home with wireless signal.
So like a Google Home speaker, you can ask the Nest Wifi point for the weather or any other query or command.
If you don’t already have one (or more), Google’s second-generation Nest Mini speaker is well worth picking up today at Best Buy.
