GameStop is hosting a one-day deal on video games, consoles, accessories, and more.
(Note: if games arenâ€™t your bag, there are more deals below on iPhone SE 2 preorders and the Pixel 4.)
In case you missed it, the iPhone SE 2 is now available for preorder.
Alternatively, Best Buy is offering a $50 gift card if you plan to upgrade your line or activate a new one via Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T.
Each size of Pixel 4 and each storage configuration is 37 percent off at the Google Store, Best Buy, and Amazon.
