The United States Internal Revenue Service launched a website for tracking coronavirus stimulus checks today, but some users are getting told their payment status is “not available,” and even after an official explanation was posted online, they have basically no way of knowing what’s wrong.
But the system has shown many people the confounding error message of “Payment Status Not Available,” since it launched, leading the phrase to trend on Twitter and show up in a slew of messages on Reddit.
The IRS asserted this afternoon that its website is “operating smoothly and effectively,” saying that 6.2 million taxpayers have received their status.
The agency is trying to avoid overloading by sending some people to a “waiting room” landing page, but it hasn’t ruled out the prospect of people seeing the “payment status unavailable” message in error.
We left a phone message with the IRS media hotline, hoping to get more information.
