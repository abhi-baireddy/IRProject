The 2020 Tribeca Film Festival was postponed because of the novel coronavirus, but you can watch its virtual reality films on the Oculus TV app from now until April 26th.
The Cinema360 program includes 15 VR films organized into four programs, each of them 30 to 40 minutes long.
Oculus TV is available on the Oculus Quest and Go headsets, although, unfortunately, not the Rift.
But once you’re inside a headset, you’re actually getting something very close to the festival experience — unlike a film, where you’re missing out on a communal big-screen experience.
The Tribeca Film Institute is also sharing a traditional short film every day on its site.
