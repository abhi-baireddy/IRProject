Preorders have begun for the iPhone SE 2, and the phone will be available on Friday, April 24th.
If you missed the original announcement a few days ago, Apple announced the successor to its beloved iPhone SE: the $399 iPhone SE 2.
The specs are a mix of what youâ€™ll find in the iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone XR, and the iPhone 8.
Best Buy is accepting preorders for the iPhone SE 2.
On the other hand, if you elect to pay full price for an unlocked iPhone SE 2, it will be ready to go right out of the box.
