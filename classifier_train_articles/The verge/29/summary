At least 14 workers have tested positive for COVID-19 at JFK8, and workers say the number is far higher.
A week later, JFK8 would become the first of several Amazon facilities to have workers walk out in protest, calling for the warehouse to be closed and cleaned after workers tested positive for COVID-19.
Minutes after the segment ended, JFK8 workers received an alert: three new cases at the facility.
Thought you wanted us to protect our workers?” Amazon public relations head Jay Carney tweeted at Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday.
The company also told workers it would institute “mandatory social distancing,” potentially firing workers who “intentionally violate” the guidelines.
