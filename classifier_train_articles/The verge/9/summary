Some workers for grocery delivery platform Instacart are still waiting on the safety kits the company promised two weeks ago, according to a new report in Wired.
And, according to shoppers Wired spoke with, the process to receive the kits was confusing and cumbersome.
Instacart said March 29th it would distribute hand sanitizer to all its full-service shoppers, most of whom are independent contractors.
On April 2nd, the company said the shoppers would get “health and safety kits” that included a reusable face mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer.
Instacart shoppers staged a one-day work stoppage March 30th to protest what they viewed as unsafe working conditions, and demanded the company not only provide personal protective equipment for shoppers but hazard pay as well.
