Instagram Live launched in 2016, but it took a pandemic for the feature to really take off.
Although there’s always been a way to save your content, most people haven’t uploaded it to IGTV or elsewhere.
In order to do that, it needs more content, and Lives are one way to populate the section.
It just updated its standalone IGTV app to better promote creators, and it also gave people the ability to tease their IGTV content in their stories.
That update suggests that Instagram is taking this pandemic time, when people are stuck inside and watching content, to bulk up and better promote IGTV.
