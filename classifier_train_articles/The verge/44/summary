If your company (like many others) uses Zoom in order to do its teleconferencing, you can hide all of that detritus using Zoom’s Virtual Background feature.
There is a long list of requirements on Zoom’s support site, depending on the type of system you’re using.
If you have a slightly lower-end system, you may still be able to use the feature, but you’ll need to have a physical green screen behind you.
You can also add a virtual background during a meeting.
In your Zoom client, click on the up-arrow next to the video symbol on the bottom leftSelect “Choose a virtual background...” That will bring you to the same Virtual Background page as before.
