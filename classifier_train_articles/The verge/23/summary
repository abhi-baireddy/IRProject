Google searches for terms related to COVID-19 will now display information for more than 2,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 43 states in the US, the company tells The Verge.
When you search for something related to COVID-19, you’ll now see a new “Testing” tab as part of the information shown in Google’s COVID-19 SOS alert.
When you click or tap that Testing tab, you’ll see a number of resources regarding COVID-19 testing at the top of your search results.
Google isn’t the only company working to make it easier to find COVID-19 testing information.
Last weekend, Apple launched a website so healthcare providers and labs that offer COVID-19 testing can submit their information and appear in Apple Maps search results as testing sites.
