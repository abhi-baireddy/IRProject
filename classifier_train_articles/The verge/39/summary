OnePlus announced the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z wireless headphones at its OnePlus launch event today.
They’re the latest model in OnePlus’ Bullets line of headphones, which last saw an update with the Bullets Wireless 2 in May 2019.
The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z will cost $49.95 and are “coming soon,” according to OnePlus’ store page for the new headphones.
Like the Bullets Wireless 2, the Bullets Wireless Z only need a 10-minute charge to offer up to 10 hours of audio playback, according to OnePlus.
And like the Bullets Wireless and Bullets Wireless 2, the Bullets Wireless Z have magnets on the back of each bud, so you can snap the buds together to hang them around your neck like a necklace.
