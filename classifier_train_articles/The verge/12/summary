Amazon is now using thermal cameras at its warehouses to help screen workers for fevers, Reuters reports.
The thermal imaging cameras are faster to use than the standard forehead thermometers Amazon had been using to test workers for fevers, which are a primary symptom of the coronavirus.
Amazon already has hired the 100,000 workers it announced it would be adding to deal with the surge in orders.
With cases of the virus reported at more than 50 Amazon warehouses in the US — one estimate puts the number of cases at more than 300 — workers have protested at several Amazon facilities, demanding warehouses be closed and cleaned.
It’s now building its own testing lab for workers, to test them for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
