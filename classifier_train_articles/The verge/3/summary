The backgrounds are pulled from across the Star Wars universe, letting you pretend that you’re taking your weekly staff meeting from the Emperor’s throne on Exegol, the deck of an Imperial Star Destroyer, a Rebel Alliance hanger bay, or a variety of other Star Wars locations.
And like the best video chat backgrounds, the new Star Wars ones have all the characters removed from the shots, allowing you to take the role of your favorite Star Wars hero.
(In fact, depending on how much you annoy your co-workers with Star Wars talk — like this post — they may already assume that anyway.)
Of course, Disney and Lucasfilm are by no means the first companies to offer high-quality cinematic backgrounds to use with Zoom or other video chat apps.
My colleague Natt Garun has also put together a list of excellent resources and ideas for fancy, fun, and fabulous Zoom backgrounds.
