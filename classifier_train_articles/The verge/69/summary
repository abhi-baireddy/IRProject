We recently ran a roundup of some of the free videoconferencing apps available, including Zoom.
If you’re using Skype to host a meeting, you’re probably better off downloading the app.
While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a fairly generous free version that’s worth checking out.
Video meetups with chat appsA lot of us are already using Slack and / or Microsoft Teams, which do have a limited number of video meeting features.
If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual.
