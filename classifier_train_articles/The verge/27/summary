Google has given its Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL unlocked phones a big price cut that lasts until May 9th at 11:59PM PT, or until supplies last.
Each size and storage configuration is $300 off at the Google Store, Best Buy, and Amazon.
Google may soon introduce the Pixel 4A, a more affordable version of the Pixel 4 that will likely have fewer features.
If the rumors for this year’s Pixel 4A hold true, it may launch at $399, just $100 less than this discounted Pixel 4.
You’ll be able to customize how much storage you want, the color, and whether you want the $499 Pixel 4 or $599 Pixel 4 XL:
