But I work from home a lot, and a standing desk would never work for me at home, because they tend to be quite large.
Armed with this wisdom, I headed over to my (retail) therapist — Amazon — where Avantree’s adjustable laptop table caught my eye.
I went for the medium size, which has a tabletop that’s 21 x 12 inches and can be raised between 9.4–12.6 inches.
If I put it on top of the regular desk I work from in my bedroom, the setup affords me enough height that you could call it a makeshift standing desk.
But since I hate to stand, I will just mess with the table’s height until it’s ideal for my neck and elbows while seated.
