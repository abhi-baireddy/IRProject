While prosecutors said in court Friday that Nott had no felony convictions in his background, the Chicago Tribune reported shortly after his arrest in 2016 that he had two lesser convictions on his record.
Court records from New Hampshire and Illinois showed that Nott was convicted of a prowling charge while he was a college track coach on the East Coast and of a misdemeanor years earlier in a downstate window peeping case.
