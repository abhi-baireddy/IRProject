COVID-19 not only threatens the lives of black residents, it also promises to bring more guns to Chicago’s streets.
Purchasing a firearm to ward off a pandemic is flawed thinking.
But that hasn’t stopped Illinois residents from contributing to a surge of gun sales in recent weeks.
Tragically, many of the guns that people are “panic buying” today, will end up in the hands of individuals who cannot pass a criminal background check, increasing the chances of arming a potentially dangerous individual.
We cannot let these illegal guns flood our neighborhoods and take even more lives.
