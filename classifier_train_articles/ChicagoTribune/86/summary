Reichert: We’re a scrappy bunch in Dayton, I’ll say that.
We consider Dayton a city of inventors and a blue-collar city.
The airplane was invented there by the Wright Brothers, not North Carolina — make no mistake about it.
There’s a sense of a kind of creative spirit, that we were almost like the Silicon Valley of two generations ago.
And we’re proud of the fact that we’ve made it through some really, really horrible times and we’re still there.
