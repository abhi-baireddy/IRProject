A culture that too often tells us our principal goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained.
A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.
Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
And because it’s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential — and become full-grown.”
