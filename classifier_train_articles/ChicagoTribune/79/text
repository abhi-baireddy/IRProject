I spent two nights in the pandemic wing of a city hospital during a global virus event, but I was one of the lucky ones. Had I reported to the emergency room only experiencing the viral symptoms, which were pretty rough, I would have been sent home, my doctor said. I was there because of my stomach issue and just happened to have the coronavirus as well. The other patients on my floor likely were much worse off than me.
