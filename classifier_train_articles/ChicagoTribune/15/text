While the Bears typically design contracts so they will not be a hindrance for more than two years, Burton’s deal was different. As part of his $22 million guarantee, the team owes him $4 million of what was supposed to be a $6.7 million base salary for this season. Add a $100,000 workout bonus and Burton’s release clears $2.8 million in cash for the Bears. His release also will create $2.8 million in cap space if the team processes it as a post-June 1 cut, meaning he’ll count more against the team’s cap in 2021.
