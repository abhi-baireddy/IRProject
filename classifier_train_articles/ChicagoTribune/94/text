"You don't have to look too far in any kind of way to see this president and the administration promoting racism in their policies, and in the choices of words. And something like calling the virus, 'China virus,' and not taking any kind of responsibility of seeing what that xenophobia and that hatred provokes in a people is just completely reprehensible. I also think, and really feel, that people know and understand what a global crisis this is. There is no time and no place for racism. We don't have time for it."
