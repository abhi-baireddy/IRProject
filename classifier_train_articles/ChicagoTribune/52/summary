View this post on InstagramTwo weeks ago, I went to pick up a prescription.
Through my brief interaction with the pharmacist I observed that she was not in the "best of moods."
When I proceeded to pay up front, I casually asked the checkout person, "Is Esther stressed?"
Overwhelmed.
If you have a prescription to pick up, be a little softer.
