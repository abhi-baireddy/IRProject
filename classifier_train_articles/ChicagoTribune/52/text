Two weeks ago, I went to pick up a prescription. Through my brief interaction with the pharmacist I observed that she was not in the "best of moods." When I proceeded to pay up front, I casually asked the checkout person, "Is Esther stressed?" To which she replied, "Girl, they have so much on their plates back there. YES! She is STRESSED!" ⁣ ⁣ As I left, it got me to thinking that of course she would be overwhelmed: overwhelmed with demand; overwhelmed with dealing with the emotions of anxious patients; overwhelmed with people thinking that their health is number one while never stopping to considering hers; overwhelmed with having to come to work every single day in this craziness and not being able to say no.⁣ ⁣ Later that day, I went back to the pharmacy and gave her one of our Crappy Happy bouquets. I told her "Just remember, when a patient is being shitty, just look to the bouquet to remind yourself that there are a 100x's more people out there who appreciate the rainbow that you are. We thank you and appreciate you."⁣ ⁣ She was shocked. Overwhelmed. Speechless. Until she said, fighting back tears, "This made my day."⁣ ⁣ Originally this was going to be our April Mission for the JOY CLUB but it became apparent that increased interaction in convenience stores and pharmacies was not the best idea. So pay it forward if you can. If you have a prescription to pick up, be a little softer. They are part of the secondary front line.
