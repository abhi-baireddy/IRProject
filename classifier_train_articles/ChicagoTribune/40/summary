You needn't be a believer in anything but the greatness of cinema to be so moved and transported.
But for those of us who do attend churches, synagogues, mosques and other houses of worship, it is no stretch to see the movie theater as another kind of temple â€” an essential forum, in its own right, for the blessings of joy, restoration and communion.
As temples go, a theater is not even a strictly secular venue: I know I'm not the only one who emerged from Carlos Reygadas' "Silent Light" and Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" feeling genuinely closer to God.
