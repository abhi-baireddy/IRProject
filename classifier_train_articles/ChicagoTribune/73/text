“I chose UIC because Coach Yaklich and Coach Dee Brown reached out to me early in process and showed interest in me,” Griffin said. “Even before I was out of high school, Coach Yaklich, when he was at Illinois State, he was showing interest in me. I could see myself playing at all four schools, but the connection that I had with Coach Yaklich and coming home and playing in front of my brothers and family and having a support system was important to me.”
