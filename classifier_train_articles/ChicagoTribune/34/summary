“This at a minimum clarifies that the IDOC can do what we are asking it to do in our lawsuit, Money v. Pritzker, to medically furlough all specially vulnerable prisoners for the duration of the emergency,” Alan Mills of the Uptown People’s Law Center said in a statement.
“This is a very positive move.
It allows the IDOC to transfer thousands of prisoners to any place (including their homes) where they will be able to follow the Governor’s orders requiring people to shelter in place and maintain social distance.”
