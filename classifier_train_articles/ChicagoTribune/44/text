Syracuse led Kansas 76-64 with five minutes remainging, but the Orange got sloppy and the Jayhawks stormed back. With 24 seconds remaining, Kansas had a chance to tie the game. Kansas guard Kirk Hinrich missed a three-pointer with eight seconds left and the Jayhawks were forced to foul Syracuse forward Hakim Warrick — who missed a pair of free throws. Still with a chance to tie the game, Hinrich rushed the ball up the court and passed to Michael Lee in the corner. Warrick then made up for his missed free throws by blocking Lee’s three-point attempt with seven-tenths of a second to go. Syracuse held on to the lead 81-78 and captured the first national title in school history. Syracuse’s Carmelo Anthony, who scored 20 points in the game, became the third freshman in NCAA tournament history to earn most outstanding player honors.
