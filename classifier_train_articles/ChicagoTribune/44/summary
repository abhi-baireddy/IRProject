Syracuse led Kansas 76-64 with five minutes remainging, but the Orange got sloppy and the Jayhawks stormed back.
With 24 seconds remaining, Kansas had a chance to tie the game.
Still with a chance to tie the game, Hinrich rushed the ball up the court and passed to Michael Lee in the corner.
Warrick then made up for his missed free throws by blocking Leeâ€™s three-point attempt with seven-tenths of a second to go.
Syracuse held on to the lead 81-78 and captured the first national title in school history.
