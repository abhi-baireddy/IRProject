“Putting a 10-year-old boy in front of a screen and expecting them to have a deep conversation with a classmate he now hasn’t seen in a month and expecting it to be organic and natural is just not going to work for a lot of kids,” she said. “Parents are imposing a lot of their own anxiety on their children when they say things like, ‘Why aren’t you calling anyone? You need to get on the Zoom call!’ Not only is it OK for them to not acquire all of the school content in this period, it’s also OK if they’re not quite as connected to their peers. If it’s not bothering them, let it go.”
