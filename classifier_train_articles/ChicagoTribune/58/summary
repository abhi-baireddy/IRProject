Depending on the morning, I wake up feeling some semblance of that hope or, just as likely, a mixture of dread and fear that tens of thousands of more people will die from COVID-19 and a vaccine will never be developed and our children will grow up surrounded by grief and the economy will take a decade or more to recover and whole cities and towns will descend into the dual grips of poverty and unemployment and the wealth gap and life expectancy gap will grow even wider and the arts will dry up and college will become accessible only to the uber wealthy left among us.
