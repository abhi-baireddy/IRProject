Michael's long-awaited testimony is at the center of Mandell's trial that got underway Tuesday at the Dirksen U.S.
Courthouse.
Michael, a beefy ex-banker who runs a realty office on the Northwest Side, barely glanced at Mandell as he took the witness stand in the afternoon.
For much of his testimony, Michael calmly kept his arms crossed in front of him as he listened to a question, then leaned forward into the microphone to answer in his baritone voice.
