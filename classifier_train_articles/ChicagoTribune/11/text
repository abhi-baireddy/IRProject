When the project first was announced, it was expected to debut in 2019. By the end of 2018, it was clear it wasn’t coming out until 2020.

ESPN needed programming with no games to present, and fans almost immediately called for the series’ rollout to be moved up. Just one problem: Production had to be rushed to finish it so it could run sooner.
