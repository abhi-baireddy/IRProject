Little is known about Brackett’s accident Wednesday, which happened on a South Side stretch of the Lakefront Trail near 39th Street. Brackett’s family told her colleagues that she was found several feet from the bike trail, which is not far from her South Side home, said Phil Ponce, host of “Chicago Tonight.” A still-anonymous good Samaritan saw Brackett and performed CPR until paramedics arrived, according to the station. Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford told WTTW that paramedics saw “no signs of trauma, no dirt, bruises, scrapes, contusions, anything that indicated she collided with something or had a fall or struck something.”
