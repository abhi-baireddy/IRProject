The Lions cannot make the mistake the Browns did two years ago when they selected Ohio State cornerback Denzel Ward at No. 4, filling a need but leaving some really good players on the board in guard Quenton Nelson and outside linebacker Bradley Chubb. Here’s betting the Browns would do it differently if they knew now what they didn’t then. Okudah is a better prospect than Ward, though, and can stabilize the secondary if GM Bob Quinn doesn’t opt for a front-seven defender.
