“Hey, Chicago!” the lead singer of the 100-million-record-selling New Jersey band said. “I heard you guys are about to open up your windows and scream and shout to ‘Livin’ On A Prayer.' Want you to know that I’m just warming up, getting ready to sing along with you. In these trying times I’m with you with all of my heart and my soul.”
