Back in 2017, Thundercat (his name is also a Dragon Ball Z reference) released his breakthrough third album, Drunk.
But Bruner’s work began rippling more widely still.
Bruner’s fourth album as Thundercat finds him meditating on the loss of Miller and embracing the multiple, contradictory strands of his art.
On It Is What It Is – the title sighs at the normalisation of loss – what “it” is varies wildly.
It all makes for an album that gently weeps, then does a set of star jumps.
