Queensland’s chief medical officer has posted a list of “Covid-19 hot spots” in New South Wales and ordered anyone returning to the state from those locations to quarantine for 14 days.
Queensland residents are exempt from the ban, but from Saturday those returning home from a list of designated interstate “Covid-19 hot spots” will be forced to undergo two weeks quarantine.
Announcing the new policy on Friday, the Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, said the “hot spots” had been chosen by the state’s chief medical officer, Jeannette Young.
In a statement, Queensland Health said the hotspots “may be expanded or amended in the coming days”.
Queensland recorded 13 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, and had seen 965 cases in total.
