Care England, Britain’s largest representative body for care homes, told the Daily Telegraph that up to 7,500 care home residents may have died of the virus.
“Without testing, it is very difficult to give an absolute figure,” Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said.
Public Health England said there were 3,084 care homes with Covid-19 outbreaks in England, as of 15 April.
Care England has not published the data behind its estimation, but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the health and social care committee on Friday that figures for care home deaths would be published “very shortly”.
We are currently working with CQC [Care Quality Commission] and other organisations to understand how to best to provide up to date information about deaths in care homes and elsewhere.”
