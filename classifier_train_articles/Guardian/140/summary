The situation has left GPs facing an invidious choice: accept the 50% rent reduction or risk losing an existing tenant and the entirety of their rent for the next six months.
Both GP clinics and pathology services – which provide Covid-19 testing – form a crucial part of the response to the pandemic.
Letters from Laverty Pathology and Western Diagnostics Pathology, owned by the pathology giant Healius, have been sent to clinics across the country.
The rent reduction, if accepted, could cost clinics $7,000 to $15,000 a year for each full-time GP.
The moratorium on opening new pathology centres where an existing collection centre closes will operate between 27 March and 30 September 2020.
