To talk of Björk’s Utopia as a rebirth is no stretch.
The sounds here are airy and lush, suggesting naturescapes and freedom.
Again, jungle birds and flutes feature, the flutes played by an all-female Icelandic ensemble assembled by Björk for the purpose.
Traditionalists might still wonder where all the nice steady beats have gone, why so little music here is anchored.
The dominant message, though, is of limitlessness, of hope and, on Future Forever, of “a matriarchal dome” with “musical scaffolding”.
