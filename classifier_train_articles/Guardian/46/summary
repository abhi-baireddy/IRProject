The housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, praised local government workers as “unsung heroes” and said the extra cash – which followed an earlier £1.6bn injection in March – would enable councils to maintain essential services.
It said some councils were preparing to issue a Section 114 [insolvency] notice and impose “extreme cost-cutting and rationing measures” to rein in budgets.
Some councils have seen up to 20% of council tax direct debits cancelled so far in April as a result of the economic impact of Covid-19.
Councils are also haemorrhaging income from parking fees, leisure centre fees and other charges as a result of the lockdown.
Councils rely on fees and charges to finance about 10% of their budgets, on average, although this reliance rises to about 25% for county councils.
