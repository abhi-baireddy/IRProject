The government has accepted that some personal protective equipment (PPE) is in short supply and promised that a large consignment, including 400,000 gowns, is due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday.
There are concerns that some PPE supplies are close to running out.
“No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks.
“If fluid repellent gowns or coveralls are not available, then surgeons should not risk their health,” he said in a statement.
The new guidelines mark a U-turn on original guidance that full-length waterproof surgical gowns should be worn during high-risk procedures.
