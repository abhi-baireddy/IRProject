These grotesque visions of bodily trauma from Argentina reflect a country still coming to terms with decades of violent dictatorshipArgentinian writer Mariana Enríquez’s first book to appear in English, translated by Megan McDowell, is gruesome, violent, upsetting – and bright with brilliance.
A schoolgirl yanks out her fingernails with her teeth in response to “what the man with slicked-back hair made her do”.
The relentless grotesquerie avoids becoming kitsch by remaining grounded in its setting: a modern Argentina still coming to terms with decades of violent dictatorship.
• Things We Lost in the Fire, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Portobello.
