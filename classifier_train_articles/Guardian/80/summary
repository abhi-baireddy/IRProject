The glad tidings are that No_One Ever Really Dies is not one of those rock fusions NERD have made in the past just to prove how versatile the production duo of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (and their childhood friend Shae Haley) could be.
There is a strong Yolo bent, redolent of Pharrell’s Skateboard P days, to No_One Ever Really Dies.
One track, Don’t Don’t Do It!, even breaks into something like ska.
At the album’s first playback in California, Williams explained that the title of Don’t Don’t Do It!
Another fly in the ointment: it is unclear how much Chad Hugo (or, indeed, Shae Haley) was involved in No_One Ever Really Dies.
