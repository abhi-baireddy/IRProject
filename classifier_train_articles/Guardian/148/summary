Doubts over the NRL’s intention to restart the competition in May have been highlighted by Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, who expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon.
Kelly also said a return to the field of play on 28 May could be too soon given how rapidly the virus can be spread.
“I don’t think they [the NRL] are a law unto themselves,” Kelly said.
“They’re making their plans for the road out [of the shutdown] and I encourage them to do so in other sports.
“If the NRL want to go ahead, [I’m] happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it’s appropriate,” Hazzard said.
