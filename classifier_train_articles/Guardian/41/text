Hundreds of people have packed together, shoulder to shoulder today, at a protest organized by conspiracy theorists in Austin, Texas. They chanted: “Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!”



Few of the protesters were wearing masks.

Footage of a crowd of people calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading public health expert advising the Trump administration, to be fired was captured by the New York Times.

The protest at Texas’ capitol was organized by a contributor to the conspiracy theory website InfoWars. Alex Jones, the site’s founder, showed up and bellowed into a bullhorn at the center of the packed crowd.

“I see a bunch of healthy Americans out here who don’t seem to be afraid of a virus,” Owen Shroyer, the InfoWars personality who organized the “You Can’t Close America” protest, told the crowd, according to footage of the protest live streamed on Periscope by an InfoWars supporter.

“What are they going to do if we have events like this all over the country, with thousands of people showing up, and the virus doesn’t spread like they told us?” Shroyer asked.

“If I want to go out to the gym or the club, or a restaurant, I’m not going to wear a mask,” Shroyer said.

“Neither am I!” a woman shouted back at him.

Shroyer referred to “the coronavirus hoax” on the livestream, then added that while there was a real virus, “the hysteria, the shutdown,” was the hoax.
