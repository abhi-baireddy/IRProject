However, there have been a handful of surprises too, those players who enjoyed the sort of seasons few could have predicted.
Here are five players who broke out to end up in that yearâ€™s team of the season.
What followed was a spate of debilitating injuries that ensured Diaby would start just 23 Premier League more matches before his contract expired in 2015.
He scored 12 goals, set up eight more all while while averaging 3.3 shots, 2.1 key passes and even 1.7 successful dribbles per 90 minutes.
Fellaini scored 11 goals this season, having netted just six in the previous three Premier League campaigns combined.
