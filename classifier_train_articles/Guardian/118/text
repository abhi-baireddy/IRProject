Guardian Australia’s morning mail is a daily wrap of what’s happening. It gives you the news headlines, the latest from sport, and the stories we love – both from the Guardian and elsewhere around the web. Plus, it has a few pointers on the day ahead and what to watch out for. It’s written each weekday by one of our staff and sent early in the morning, so you can check it out as soon as you wake up or when you are on your way to work.

Sign up now to get the morning mail straight to your inbox before 7am every weekday. See the latest morning mail here.
