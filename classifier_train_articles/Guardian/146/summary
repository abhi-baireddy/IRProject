The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, announced on Wednesday that Australian drama, children’s and documentary content quotas on free-to-air and subscription television would be suspended for 2020, although the requirement for 55% Australian content overall remained.
Labor has welcomed the package but accused the government of being slow to respond to industry demands for support, which predate Covid-19.
The media industry has been hammered by falling advertising revenue during the coronavirus crisis, prompting the suspension of printing of local community titles by Australian Community Media and News Corp Australia.
Despite rebuffing calls to abolish content quotas and cut TV licence fees as recently as November, Fletcher extended an assistance package based on those measures on Wednesday.
He explained that content obligations had been suspended because Covid-19 had “effectively halted production of Australian screen content”.
