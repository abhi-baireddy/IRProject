The German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
has been praised for her explanation of how the coronavirus spreads and why deciding when to lift a lockdown is such a complex issue.
Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, said that physical distancing measures had brought a 'fragile intermediate success' and helped 'flatten the curve', but added that these rules would remain in place until at least 3 May but some shops could reopen next week
