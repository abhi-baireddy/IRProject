Hundreds of people in Florida reportedly flocked to several beaches as they reopened for “essential activities” after being closed because of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the state’s death toll climbing to 726.
The Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who was widely criticized for moving slowly to contain the outbreak, permitted some reopenings.
“Do it in a safe way.”The areas that reopened were in north Florida, including stretches of sand in Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach, local TV reported.
The “essential activities” permitted at Jacksonville Beach include “recreational activities consistent with social distancing guidelines such as walking, biking, hiking, fishing, running, swimming, taking care of pets and surfing”.
“We’ll get back to life as we know it but we must be patient.”Surfers run into the waves in Jacksonville Beach.
