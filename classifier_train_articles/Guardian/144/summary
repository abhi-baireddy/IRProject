Here's everything you need to know to registerThe Morrison government has passed a $130bn support package with a new jobkeeper payment â€“ a wage subsidy to keep Australians in work.
The federal government will pay eligible employers $1,500 per fortnight for each eligible worker, about 70% of the national median wage.
State and local government employees might be eligible for state schemes, but not the commonwealth jobkeeper payment.
On 30 March, Scott Morrison said a person receiving the jobkeeper payment cannot also receive the jobseeker payment (formerly Newstart).
At the moment, Australians out of work are not eligible for the jobseeker payment if their partner earns $48,000 or more.
