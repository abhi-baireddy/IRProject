Does the cruise ship report imply that viruses survive up to 17 days on surfaces?
Dr Julia Marcus: A CDC investigation of the cruise ship found evidence of viral RNA in cabins that hadn’t yet been cleaned.
Marcus: The New England Journal of Medicine just published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting.
But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces.
How many people are being contaminated via surfaces as opposed to airborne particles or direct contact with an infected person?
