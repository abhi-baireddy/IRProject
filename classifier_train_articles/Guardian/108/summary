That’s the simplest explanation for this unexpected new Miley Cyrus album, one that arrived last week, following a preview of lead track Dooo It!

“The sunrise insists on gladness/ But how can I be glad when my flower is dead?” Cyrus warbles.
For every 1 Sun – unexpected enviro-pop with a lysergic edge – there are two Miley Tibetan Bowlz, in which Cyrus ululates over the sound of ringing eastern tones.
What is most surprising, perhaps, is not that Miley Cyrus has self-released a goofy, addled sonic experiment, but that, in the post-label, internet age, more pop stars in her position haven’t.
