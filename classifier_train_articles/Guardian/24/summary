Donald Trumpâ€™s former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will reportedly be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Cohen began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.
Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.
As of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the US.
Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars.
