The analogy of the all-seeing novelist is hard to resist: Dunmore perched on high, peering down into the lives playing out below.
In The Siege, set 10 years earlier during the deadly Leningrad blockade, Dunmore set out a world of shrinking horizons.
All these different disciplines – fiction, poetry, short stories (she's published four collections to date), children's novels – do they come from the same place?
"I had a period of writing very little poetry that worked, in part because of the death of my father four years ago," Dunmore says.
I've noticed, in the course of a writing life, that sometimes it's better to wait than to force the issue.
