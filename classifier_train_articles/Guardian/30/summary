There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen.
So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19?
The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago.
Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal.
We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks.
