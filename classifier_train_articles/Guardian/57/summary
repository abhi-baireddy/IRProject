Scientists have pinpointed a population of virus-infected bats, which they have linked to the mysterious outbreak of Sars disease 15 years ago.
This strain has all the genetic building blocks of the type that triggered the global outbreak of Sars in 2002.
Scientists initially suspected that civet cats, sold in markets in China, were the source of the virus but later turned their attention to bats, which they realised were the prime source of the virus.
These strains often mix and could have produced a strain that caused the Sars outbreak.
“We now have something concrete to work on, and I applaud the openness of these Chinese scientists in sharing their work and – I hope – these virus strains.”
