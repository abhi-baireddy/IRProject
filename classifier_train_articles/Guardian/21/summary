The Trump administration has given the World Health Organization an ultimatum to carry out reforms and change policy towards China and coronavirus, but diplomats said the White House has not made clear exactly what it wants the WHO to do.
It gives $119m a year in assessed contributions (membership dues) and $328m in donations, and is currently about $200m in arrears.
A senior administration official said the Trump administration was within its rights to divert funds to other organisations in the same field.
The White House issued an account of a conference call between the leaders of the G7 industrialised democracies, claiming “much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO”.
However, that is not the approach the White House has taken so far, aware that Tedros was elected by member states.
