With its Blakean set-up, there was hope that U2’s Songs of Experience might have seen the mature U2 pugnaciously restate their purpose, 14 albums into their career.
Songs of Innocence (2014) focused tightly on the band’s formative experiences against the backdrop of the Troubles.
When a Bono vocal sample landed on XXX on Kendrick Lamar’s Damn album, the compass was spinning that way.
There is little evidence, however, of any alarm or horror here: both key to Blake’s Experience poems.
But these Songs of Experience lack William Blake’s moral fervour or rage.
