His 2011 debut album as Childish Gambino, Camp, drew curiosity and disdain.
It comes in two forms, one without track breaks, credited to Donald Glover, and one with, credited to Childish Gambino.
But this record was worth the wait and is worth your time, a comprehensive deep-dive made for the dedicated concentration of self-isolation.
As engaging as these songs are on multiple levels, 3.15.20 really excels when Glover experiments with form, texture and sensory overload.
If Glover tackles the roles of lover and partner, elsewhere he plays both a son and a father.
