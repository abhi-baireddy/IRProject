LMK, the lead track, is Kelela’s most accessible case in point.
The no-strings hook-up is a standard trope of pop music, but Kelela is nobody’s disposable night friend.
To generalise: up top, Kelela’s melodic coos are silken, layered and vulnerable, cleaving to song forms that traditionalists would recognise.
Perhaps less well known is the input of producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Haim, Charli XCX), and the xx’s Romy Madley Croft.
These are unanchored R&B songs for unmoored times, with Kelela’s alluring vocals holding fast, front and centre.
