But there aren’t all that many songs about one modern situation: your lover’s new-found sobriety, and where that leaves you.
The Wilds are both the wilds of New England and the darkness inside.
Real Peach, the catchy, intellectual centrepiece of this album, came out on The Rains EP (2016) and became something of a runaway success on the platform: 20m streams and counting.
The song Sunlit Juice was directly inspired by Jamison’s girlfriend’s sobriety.
If The Wilds doesn’t quite answer that question, it is unflinching in examining, time and again, who we are to each other.
