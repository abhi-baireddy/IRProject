Covid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis.
Is there any way to know whether someone has had Covid-19 in the past?
The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it.
We just don’t know [for how long] at this point, because we don’t have the kind of testing available to screen for asymptomatic infections.
Should someone behave differently if they think, but don’t know for certain, that they have already had it?
