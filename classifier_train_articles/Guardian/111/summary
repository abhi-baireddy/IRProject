Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia.
Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Health announced that a 95-year-old woman who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson lodge died overnight.
The woman is the fifth person to die from coronavirus in the home.
This will be a separate and temporary register to the existing register of medical practitioners.
The organisations – Care Australia, ChildFund Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia – said the not-for-profit sector was facing a perfect storm of falling revenue and unprecedented demand for their services fuelled by the pandemic.
