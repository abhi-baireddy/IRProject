Ordinarily, a week that includes new releases from directors Xavier Dolan and Richard Linklater would count as a major one in most cinephiles’ books.
For the coronavirus shutdown isn’t the reason you’re not seeing Dolan’s The Death and Life of John F Donovan or Linklater’s Where’d You Go, Bernadetteon the big screen in the UK.
I’d love to tell you that these films deserved better; sadly, neither can be called underrated.
It’s just disappointingly beige given the seemingly winning combination of Linklater, star Cate Blanchett and Maria Semple’s sly, nimble comic novel.
Linklater is reattempting that trick next, embarking on a two-decade schedule to film Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along.
