The Queen’s 94th birthday on Tuesday will be a low-key affair owing to the coronavirus pandemic, with no official gun salutes for what is believed to be the first time in her long reign.
It is traditional for royal gun salutes to be fired from different locations in London and across the UK on the monarch’s birthday.
“Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances,” a Buckingham Palace source said.
In London, salutes are traditionally fired from the Tower of London and Hyde Park on the Queen’s birthday.
In Hyde Park, a royal park, there are an extra 20 rounds, making it a 41-gun salute.
