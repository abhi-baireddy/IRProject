“There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis,” Harwin said in a statement.
“At all times I have sought to act in accordance with public health orders and I sought advice that my living arrangements complied with those orders.
“These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health.
“Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody.
Accordingly, minister Harwin has appropriately resigned from cabinet.”The arts minister was spotted earlier this week at his million-dollar Pearl Beach house.
