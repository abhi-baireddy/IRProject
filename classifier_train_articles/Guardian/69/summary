Hundreds of Britons stranded in Bangladesh by the coronavirus lockdown are to return home after the UK government chartered four repatriation flights.
Tickets will cost £600, and are being part-funded by the government’s £75m scheme to organise repatriation flights from countries where commercial routes have shut down as a result of the pandemic.
The repatriation flights are part of wider efforts to bring 7,000 Britons home from south Asia.
Meanwhile, another repatriation flight will bring UK nationals back to Britain from Sierra Leone on Wednesday.
Passengers travelling from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, must report to the Sea Coach terminal in the Aberdeen area of the city between 12pm and 3pm on Wednesday.
