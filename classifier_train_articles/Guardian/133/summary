The federal government says it will make Australian childcare services free during the coronavirus crisis, with priority given to parents who need to continue working.
It is promoting its plan as a way to help childcare centres remain open and viable through the crisis.
From 6 April, the government will start making payments to childcare centres at the rate of about 50% of the usual fees.
Again, childcare services that continue operating will be required not to charge families any fee at all.
Again, the new funding goes directly to childcare centres.
