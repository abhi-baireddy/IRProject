Trend has been replicated in all nations, but scientists cannot yet fathom the causeMen are much more likely to die from coronavirus - but why?
But it has become increasingly apparent that it also discriminates by sex, with the latest UK data from the Office for National Statistics revealing that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease.
In Spain, data released on Thursday suggests twice as many men as women have died and in the UK, of the 4,122 deaths registered, 2,523 were men and 1,599 women.
Some studies have shown that men are less likely to wash their hands, less likely to use soap, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice.
Sex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are taking place across the world.
