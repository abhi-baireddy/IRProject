In a tale titled Légende du Beau Pécopin et de la Belle Bauldour, Victor Hugo writes about a meeting between the devil and a group of saints.
The devil needs help.
But the saints decline to give it, for a variety of reasons.
Do people give to one another because it’s good, or because it makes them feel good?
Is altruistic giving ever actually altruistic?
