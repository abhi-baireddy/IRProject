Because grocery stores are among the essential businesses that have carried on during the pandemic, their workers are in constant proximity of potentially sick shoppers.
So far, they’ve varied widely, often leaving workers without protective equipment in circumstances where social distancing is impossible.
“The coronavirus pandemic represents the greatest health and safety crisis that America’s grocery and food workers have ever faced,” UFCW president Marc Perrone said.
Meanwhile Walmart, Kroger, Amazon, and others are frantically hiring tens of thousands of workers to meet surging demand.
Kroger, for instance, has limited its stores to being filled to just 50% capacity to make social distancing easier.
