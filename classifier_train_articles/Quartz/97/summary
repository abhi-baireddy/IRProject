If you live in the United States, chances are you’ve heard guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about social distancing.
For now, these guides for social distancing are based on data collected on other pathogens—some of which may be outdated.
Quartz tried to find the origins of the six-foot guideline with the CDC, but after multiple attempts over two weeks, the agency failed to comment.
One thing that could dramatically influence recommendations for social distancing is if SARS-CoV-2 could not merely be transmitted via droplets, but in even smaller particles called aerosols.
Which is likely why, even though six feet is a good guideline, it’s not wise to walk right up to it, literally speaking.
