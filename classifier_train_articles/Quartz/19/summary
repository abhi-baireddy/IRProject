India is four times more populous than the US, but has just 2% the number of cases and only 1.5% of the number of Covid-19 deaths.
India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths.
By shutting down travel and factories, it has eliminated transport-linked deaths and deaths triggered by air pollution.
Physical distancing measures may also lower deaths from influenza, just as they reduce Covid-19 deaths.
So it is theoretically possible that Covid-19 has had a substantial mortality impact, but that total deaths have not risen because the lockdown reduced non-Covid deaths.
