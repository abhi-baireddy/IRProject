In January 2020, the US unemployment rate was at 3.6%.
Yet the researchers project that the unemployment rate in April will be around 6%, just a two percentage point jump from January.
The headline unemployment rate reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is calculated by taking the number of people looking for work and dividing that by that same number plus the number of people employed.
For example, in January 2020, BLS found that 5.9 million people were looking for work, and about 164.6 million were either looking for work or employed, so the unemployment rate was 5.9 million/(164.6 million + 5.9 million) or 3.6%.
The problem with using the unemployment rate formula at the moment is that only a small portion of the 20 million who lost their job because of the crisis are looking for work.
