Google and Apple are teaming up to unveil an API for digital contact tracing in May, but are restricting its use to public health authorities and governments.
The tech giants argued in a press call this week that such restrictions would keep governments from using contact tracing for mass surveillance.
Google and Apple have made some adjustments that will allow digital contact tracing apps to run more smoothly.
Fenwick said there was disagreement, even among proponents of digital contact tracing, over how the technology should be used and in what fashion.
Both nations are members of PEPP-PT—Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing—a coalition that is building “a backbone” for contact tracing apps in the EU.
