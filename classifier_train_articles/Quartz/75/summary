People around the world are reporting the temporary loss of their senses of taste and smell as doctors fight against the spread of Covid-19.
“There have been no reports in the medical literature, that I’m aware of, in terms of widespread loss of smell and taste,” Poland said at the time.
And because our senses of smell and taste are interconnected, sinusitis could also play a role in reported distortion of the sense of taste—so-called dysgeusia.
“I’ve definitely heard [from patients] about the loss of smell, I have not specifically taken care of a patient who has complained of a loss of taste.”Both of those accounts came before some mainstream medical associations began to communicate about the taste and smell loss to their member.
On Sunday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology posted onto its website a recommendation that medical professionals treat loss of taste and smell as symptoms of Covid-19.
