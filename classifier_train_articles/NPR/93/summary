More people are connecting the dots between diet and health – not just personal health, but also the health of the planet.
And the central thesis that has emerged is this: If we eat less meat, it's better for both.
That works out to about 3.5 ounces — or a single serving of red meat — per week.
And it's far less red meat than Americans currently consume on average: between an estimated 2 and 3 ounces per day.
People who eat red meat also have many other habits and dietary choices that simultaneously influence their health, too.
