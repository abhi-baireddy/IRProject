The results highlight how coronavirus is disproportionately affecting lower-income people of color.
The survey asked people how concerned they were about contracting coronavirus; of those polled 24% say they are very concerned about getting the virus.
Of that very concerned population, 43% were Hispanic, 31% black and 18% white.
Thirty-eight percent of those very concerned that they could pass coronavirus to others unknowingly were lower income.
In the last weeks in places like New York city and Chicago, officials have reported people of color dying at higher rates from coronavirus compared to white people.
