Lucy Loves Lucy In 'Take My Wife'Enlarge this image toggle caption Seeso SeesoCameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher had an idea for a show about two lesbian comics who get married and perform together.
"I Love Lucy, except we're both ... Lucy Loves Lucy," they joke to NPR's Ari Shapiro.
Their show is called Take My Wife, and it's out now on the NBC-owned streaming channel Seeso.
Esposito and Butcher got married last year, and Butcher says making the show has been "an amazing experience, but it has been a living nightmare."
It's a lot of straight male standups on stage talking about women that are off stage.
