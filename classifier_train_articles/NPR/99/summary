Boeing To Reopen Some Production Plants With New Worker Safety ProtocolsEnlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/APBoeing will start reopening its airplane manufacturing plants in Washington state next week, bringing 27,000 employees back to work under new safety protocols, the company said, even though customers are deferring and canceling orders for new planes.
Boeing says it will restart production at its commercial airplane facilities in phases beginning April 20.
Most workers will return the next day, and all the plants in the Puget Sound area are scheduled to reopen by April 24.
Among those returning will be workers preparing to restart production on the 737 Max assembly line, which has been shut down since January.
It's a sign that Boeing expects regulators to recertify the troubled Max planes within the next couple of months.
