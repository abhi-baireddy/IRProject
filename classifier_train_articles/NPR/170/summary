Enlarge this image toggle caption Hard Case Crime Hard Case CrimeFor 20 years, Stephen King has had an image stuck in his head: It's a boy in a wheelchair flying a kite on a beach.
"It was his childhood, too, that influenced his decision to go with Hard Case Crime as his publisher.
Hard Case Crime publishes new hard-boiled crime novels as well as lost ones from the past, all with original covers in the style of old pulp fiction paperbacks.
"Hard Case Crime is a throwback to the books that I loved as a kid," King says.
