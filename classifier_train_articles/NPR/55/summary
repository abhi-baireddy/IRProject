In 'Parker Looks Up,' A 2-Year-Old Shares A Moment With Michelle ObamaEnlarge this image toggle caption Mhari Shaw/NPR Mhari Shaw/NPRIn the spring of 2018, 2-year-old Parker Curry visited the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., with her mom, her sister and her best friend.
"The portrait of the first lady Michelle Obama loomed before me," Parker recalls.
Also, she adds, Michelle Obama is now her friend.
The experience has inspired a picture book — Parker Looks Up — written by Parker and her mom, Jessica Curry Morton, and illustrated by Brittany Jackson.
She remembers watching 2-year-old Parker looking up at Sherald's portrait of Obama and says Jackson's images bring "the magic of that moment back to life again."
