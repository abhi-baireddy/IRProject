To End Surprise Medical Bills, New York Tried Arbitration.
In 2015, it passed a surprise billing law that uses "baseball-style" arbitration as a way to settle payment disputes between insurance companies and doctors.
"Providers' billed charges, or list prices, are unilaterally set, largely unmoored from market forces, and generally many times higher than in-network negotiated rates or Medicare rates," Adler wrote.
According to the analysis, the number of bills undergoing arbitration went from 115 in 2015 to 1,014 in 2018.
One of the bills in Congress seeking to address surprise billing also relies on arbitration as the solution.
