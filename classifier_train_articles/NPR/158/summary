This time it's the Democratic National Convention.
Amid ongoing questions about when traditional presidential campaigning — and the travel and large crowds it entails — will be able to resume, the Democratic National Committee has delayed its nominating convention until the week of Aug. 17.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has a substantial lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, had called for a delayed convention in recent days.
Reached Thursday, Mandi Merritt, the Republican National Committee's national press secretary, said in a statement: "We are fully committed to holding the Republican convention in Charlotte as planned."
