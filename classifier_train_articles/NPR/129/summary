While full national lockdowns remain uncommon, at least 82 countries have some form of lockdown in place, according to UNICEF.
And because any premature attempts to restart economies could trigger secondary peaks in COVID-19 cases, they warn that the process must be deliberate and widely coordinated.
"You can't replace lockdown with nothing," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies program, said at a recent briefing.
"We don't want to lurch from lockdown to nothing to lockdown to nothing," Ryan said.
"We need to have a much more stable exit strategy that allows us to move carefully and persistently away from lockdown."
