Reporter's Notebook: Crossing Into Canada Before Coronavirus Closes The BorderEnlarge this image toggle caption Lars Hagberg/AFP via Getty Images Lars Hagberg/AFP via Getty ImagesIt's Monday, March 16, there are about 4,500 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States.
Fast forward, it's Friday night, March 20, I am in a hastily packed car with my family barreling towards the Canadian border.
My daughter's school is closed until the end of April, but it might be much longer.
The U.S.-Canadian border is closing by mutual agreement between the two countries to suppress the spread of the virus.
We laugh and say our kid's school is closed for a month and a half, so at least that long.
