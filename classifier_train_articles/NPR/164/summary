Primaries and other elections have been postponed in more than a dozen states so far because of concerns about the coronavirus.
The package does not require states to offer 15 days of early voting, no-excuse absentee voting and other changes some Democrats had sought.
Congressional Republicans, as well as state officials, oppose imposing federal requirements on elections, which are traditionally run by the states.
"While this funding is a step in the right direction, we must enact election reforms across the country as well as secure more resources to guarantee safe and secure elections," they said.
