New research reveals just how common surprise billing is after an elective surgery, like a knee replacement or hysterectomy.
(Twenty percent of inpatient admissions from the emergency department likely led to a surprise bill, a Health Affairs study found.)
The study found that most of the surprise bills come from either anesthesiologists or surgical assistants â€” who are typically not chosen by patients.
Surprise billing was a focus in Congress last year as well, but legislation never made it through.
There's now a lot of opportunity for Congress to take action, says Jean Fuglesten Biniek, a senior researcher at the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit research center focused on health care.
