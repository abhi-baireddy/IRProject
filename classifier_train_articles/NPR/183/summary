About 250,000 workers came to the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, the majority of them from Mexico.

One end of the food supply chain has been completely upended as restaurants go dark and consumers prowl half-empty aisles of supermarkets.
This week, the United Farm Workers union called on employers to expand paid sick leave for workers.
