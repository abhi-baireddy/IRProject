Indonesia, which is the world's fourth most populous country, did not confirm its first cases until March 2.
The university predicts cases could soar to more than 1.5 million across the country, with more than 140,000 deaths.
Indonesia's latest case numbers mean the country has surpassed its neighbor the Philippines, which previously had the most known cases in Southeast Asia.
The Philippines now has the second-highest confirmed cases in the region at 5,878, and Malaysia and Singapore are close behind, both with more than 5,000 confirmed cases.
