Ben Gibbard: Tiny Desk (Home) ConcertThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.
Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world.
"Hello, this is Ben Gibbard, welcome to Tiny Desk, Seattle style."
And with that, the heavy-hearted Death Cab for Cutie frontman performs his newly written song from America's first coronavirus hotspot, Seattle.
Ben was a long admirer of Adam's music and sings us one of his favorite Fountains of Wayne songs, as well as a song Ben wrote for The Monkees' Good Times album, a record that Adam produced.
