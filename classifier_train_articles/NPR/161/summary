Those suffering from lock in get around using robots or by renting time in the bodies of nonparalyzed Haden's survivors called integrators.
The balance established in the first pages of Lock In serves Scalzi well throughout most of the rest of the book.
He moves the story along from clue to clue and suspect to suspect, dropping out of the flow only occasionally to build neat little additions to the world he's playing in.
And that's not to say it's formulaic, but just that he knows the book he's writing.
