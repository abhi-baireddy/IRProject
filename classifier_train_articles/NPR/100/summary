Amid Coronavirus Concerns Pentagon To Send Troops To U.S.
The officials said the plan is to send up to 1,000 troops to the border with Canada to assist Customs and Border Protection as concern about COVID-19 increases.
Those provinces border the state of New York which leads the U.S. in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths.
"Part of protecting Canadians is ensuring a good supply of food, of medical supplies, of necessary equipment across our border," Trudeau said.
According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Canada has roughly 3,800 confirmed coronavirus cases; Mexico has more than 470 confirmed cases.
