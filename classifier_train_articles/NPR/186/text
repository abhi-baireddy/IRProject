"Shots in the Back: Exhuming the 1970 Augusta Riot" tells the story of one of the first major Civil Rights era riots in the South. The riot happened in Augusta, Georgia from May 11-13, 1970,. The immediate cause was the suspicious death of Charles Oatman, an African American teenager held in the county jail. During the riot, six black men were killed by white police officers, all of them shot in the back. Much of Augusta's black business district was also set ablaze, including many white and Chinese-American owned businesses. Some 1,500 members of the National Guard were called in to ease the unrest. Despite all the chaos, the riot has largely been forgotten. This podcast is a collaboration between Georgia Public Broadcasting and the Jessye Norman School of the Arts.
