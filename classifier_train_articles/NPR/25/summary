Michael McDonald: Tiny Desk (Home) ConcertThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.
Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world.
After five-time Grammy winner Michael McDonald finished "Matters Of The Heart," the opening song in his Tiny Desk (home) concert, there was a brief pause.
He sat in his home studio, complete with an illustration of the Tiny Desk drawn by Mr. McDonald himself.
The 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee then proceeded to play two 1978 Doobie Brothers classics that showcase his still-golden voice: "Minute By Minute" and "What A Fool Believes."
