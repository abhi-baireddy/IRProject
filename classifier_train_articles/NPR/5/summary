Prisoner Daryl Campbell is currently under quarantine after another inmate came down with a high fever.
Campbell, also known as Taxstone, hosted the popular hip-hop podcast Tax Season before he was arrested in 2017 in connection with a shooting.
He's still on Rikers awaiting trial on murder charges and he says inmates are not being given basic protective gear.
"The governor actually says 'Yo, we're going to be making a hand sanitizer and stuff like that,' " Campbell says.
"Being in jail is like literally being dead and watching everyone else live their life from a grave," he finishes.
