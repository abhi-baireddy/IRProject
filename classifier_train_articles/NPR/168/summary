Wisconsin Primary To Go On But Absentee Voting Extended, Federal Judge RulesEnlarge this image toggle caption Morry Gash/AP Morry Gash/APWisconsin's April 7 primary will proceed amid the coronavirus pandemic, but with significant changes, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
U.S. District Judge William Conley said he could not change the date of the election but chastised Wisconsin Gov.
"Nor is it appropriate for a federal district court to act as the state's chief health official by taking that step for them."
Instead, Conley extended the deadline for voters to submit absentee ballots from April 7 to April 13 and ordered the state to waive requirements that absentee voters have a witness sign their ballot.
Voters have requested a record 1.1 million absentee ballots ahead of the election, which includes the presidential primary as well as numerous state and local offices.
