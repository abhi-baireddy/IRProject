By contrast, surgical masks — those cheap, disposable, gauzy masks that often come in blue or green — are less uncomfortable.
But Schaffner says the scientific evidence that "there might be a benefit for people in the community wearing [surgical] face masks is very, very meager.
MacIntyre agrees there's no need to run out and buy face masks if you're in a low-risk country like the U.S.
