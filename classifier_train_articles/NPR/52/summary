What's Inside The Senate's $2 Trillion Coronavirus Aid PackageLoading...
The Senate has passed a roughly $2 trillion coronavirus response bill intended to speed relief across the American economy.
That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it.
The main features for small businesses are emergency grants and a forgivable loan program for companies with 500 or fewer employees.
The money will help cover the expected cost of new applications to the program as a result of the coronavirus.
