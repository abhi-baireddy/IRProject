Among them are Lyme disease, Rabies, West Nile, and diseases caused by coronaviruses, including this coronavirus and the SARS virus.
However, there is not enough evidence to prove that is where the virus transmitted from animals to humans.
"So, those sequences probably did arise from a virus like the pangolin coronavirus, or maybe some other coronavirus that can circulate in pangolins or some other animals."
The Rabies virus, the Marburg virus, the Hendra and Nipah viruses all find a natural reservoir in bats, meaning those viruses live in bats without harming them.
