Fighting COVID-19 Is Like 'Whack-A-Mole,' Says Writer Who Warned Of A PandemicEnlarge this image toggle caption John Locher/AP John Locher/APTwo years ago, science writer Ed Yong wrote an article for The Atlantic in which he warned that a new global pandemic was inevitable â€” and that the world would be unprepared for it when it arrived.
Now, with the outbreak of COVID-19, much of what Yong warned about in his reporting has come true.
To hope that the summer is going to downplay those dynamics far enough to contain the pandemic is, I think, wishful thinking.
A pandemic causes a wave of physical suffering, but following that, there is also economic suffering, mental suffering, emotional suffering.
I think we're going to need that if we're going to be better-prepared for what's to come.
