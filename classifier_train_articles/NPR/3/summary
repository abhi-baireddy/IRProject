The Killer At Home: House Cats Have More Impact On Local Wildlife Than Wild PredatorsEnlarge this image toggle caption Louise LeGresley/Getty Images Louise LeGresley/Getty ImagesWhat does an outdoor cat do all day?
A tracking study of more than 900 house cats shows when they kill small birds and mammals, their impact is concentrated in a small area, having a bigger effect than wild predators do.
"It actually ends up being a really intense rate of predation on any unfortunate prey species that's going to live near that cat's house," he said.
Native predators, like jungle cats, also kill a lot of small animals, but their impact is spread out over a larger area.
One study estimates that house cats, both domestic and feral, kill billions of birds every year.
