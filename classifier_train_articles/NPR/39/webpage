   <p>Celebrities are coming together, virtually, on Saturday night for a massive livestreamed concert organized to recognize front-line health care workers and to support the World Health Organization's work in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>   <p>Starting at 8 p.m. ET, "One World: Together At Home," curated by Lady Gaga, promises performances from Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Elton John, Lizzo, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. Late-night funnymen Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel will share hosting duties.</p>   <p>In partnership with the World Health Organization, the anti-poverty organization Global Citizen is putting on the event to raise money for the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate">WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund</a>. </p>   <p>"The World Health Organization is committed to defeating the coronavirus pandemic with science and public health measures, and supporting the health workers who are on the frontlines of the response," WHO Director-General Dr.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release Saturday. "We may have to be apart physically for a while, but we can still come together virtually to enjoy great music."</p>   <p>Lady Gaga, who's expected to kick off the show, posted an emotional video on Instagram leading up to the event. Thanking essential workers around the world, the pop star called the effort "a true love letter," saying she hopes it serves as "a reminder of the kindness that's occurring right now."</p>   <p>A wide variety of social media platforms will run the broadcast, including Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, in addition to major networks like CBS, ABC, and NBC.</p>   <p>You can also watch it live here:</p>   <div id="res838014004" class="bucketwrap video youtube-video large">

   <p>They still threw their caps into the air as F-16s flew overhead.</p>   <p>They still responded with a resounding "hua!" whenever anyone mentioned the class of 2020.</p>   <p>But this year's graduation of the U.S. Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs was different from any other in the institution's history. Instead of assembling in Falcon Stadium, the nearly 1,000 cadets assembled in an outdoor field on campus. They kept eight feet between them as they marched to their socially distant seats. And instead of shouting encouragement from the stands, friends and family could only sound off in the YouTube comments section.</p>   <p>"Congratulations Geraud," wrote Anthony and Dina Blackmon, among the more than 30,000 people watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6oI5rveBU0&feature=emb_logo">livestream</a>. "The Blackmons are watching! Great job!"</p>   <p>In his commencement address, Vice President Pence acknowledged the adversity facing the nation.</p>   <p>"We gather at a time of national crisis as the coronavirus epidemic impacts our nation and the wider world," Pence said. "For the first time in our history every state and territory in our land are under disaster declarations."</p>   <p>"America is being tested," Pence said later in his address. "And while there are signs that we are making progress in slowing the spread, as we stand here today more than 700,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus, and, tragically, more than 37,000 of our countrymen have lost their lives.</p>   <p>"But as each of you has shown in your time here, and as the American people always show in challenging times, when hardship comes, Americans come together," Pence continued. </p>   <p>He cited medical workers on the front lines, farmers and grocers keeping America fed, and autoworkers who are making medical equipment to save lives.</p>   <p>"With the courage, strength and compassion of the American people, we'll get through this," Pence said. "We'll protect the most vulnerable and we will heal our land."</p>   <p>The 62nd graduating class was unusual for another reason: It's the first that will send cadets into the newly created Space Force, the sixth branch of the U.S. armed forces.</p>   <p>Eighty-six cadets will join the Space Force. "You are our future and I need you to be bold," Gen. John Raymond, chief of space operations, told the class. "You will build this service from the ground up."</p>   <p>Unlike in years past, cadets didn't march to accept their diplomas. And when the class of 2020 was dismissed, the newly commissioned officers didn't embrace their fellow classmates. They quietly put their face masks on before walking off the field.</p>

   <p>To the dismay of some of its citizens and neighbors, Nicaragua is still <a href="https://www.intur.gob.ni/2020/04/representante-de-raccs-es-la-miss-verano-2020/">holding soccer matches</a>, food festivals and beauty pageants. </p>   <p>Officially, the government of socialist president Daniel Ortega says there are only three active cases and one death attributed to COVID-19. <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">The Johns Hopkins University tracker</a> cites nine cases and two deaths. Across the border in Costa Rica, authorities have confirmed more than 600 cases. </p>   <p>"No one believes the government," said Dora Maria Tellez, a staunch Ortega opponent who once served as his health minister. Now Tellez has joined health workers, scientists and activists to form the Citizens Observatory for COVID-19, to gather and publish data about the outbreak. </p>   <p>"There is no transparency of information controlled by the state," Tellez said. "The Health Ministry's webpage isn't updated, it doesn't have the number of tests run, how many are positive, how many negative." </p>   <p>Using informants in health clinics around the country, the Citizens Observatory estimates there are as many as 200 cases of COVID-19 in Nicaragua. </p>   <p>Not only has the government failed to issue stay-at-home or social distancing orders, the 74-year old Ortega dropped out of public view for more than a month. He finally reappeared Wednesday to give a live speech broadcast to the nation. Surrounded by top officials, Ortega <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqowwp7ll2U">decried the pandemic</a> as a sign from God and said the U.S. should spend less on atomic bombs and more on hospitals. </p>   <p>Ortega insisted Nicaragua's doctors are ready to treat COVID-19 and rejected shutting down the economy, saying if Nicaraguans don't work, they will die. </p>   <p>Earlier this month, Dr. Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, expressed concern about Nicaragua's response to COVID-19. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMl_vcXjNHI">cited</a> the lack of social distancing and the convening of mass gatherings. "We have concerns about testing, contact tracing and reporting of cases," she said. </p>   <p>Nicaragua's borders remain open, which worries Costa Rica. Vice President Epsy Campbell Barr said her country launched operations to secure its borders and isolate citizens. Speaking <a href="en%20Español,">on CNN</a>, Campbell Barr said Costa Rica has turned back some 6,000 Nicaraguans in the past month. She said she did not foresee any coordinated effort between the two countries to limit the virus's spread.</p>   <p>"We cannot depend absolutely on anyone else ... we are still taking these extreme measures to continue safeguarding the lives of those in our country," she said.</p>   <p>Requests for comment from Ortega's wife, who is the government's spokeswoman and vice president, were not returned. </p>

   <p>The United States and Canada have agreed to keep their shared border closed for nonessential travel for another 30 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension during a briefing Saturday in Ottawa.</p>   <p>The restrictions on the world's longest frontier took effect on March 21, while allowing trade and other travel deemed essential to continue. The partial ban was to expire soon, but the neighboring countries have decided it is not safe to allow traffic to fully resume.</p>   <p>"This is an important decision and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe," Trudeau told a news conference outside the residence where he has been living and working in recent weeks.</p>   <p>Canada, with a population of under 38 million, has had more than 32,000 cases of infection and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html">1,340 deaths from COVID-19</a>, as of Saturday. The U.S. has identified <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">almost 720,000 cases</a> and over 37,000 deaths, as of late Saturday afternoon. Several of America's hardest-hit areas including New York state share a border with Canadian provinces. Both countries have testing shortages.</p>   <p>Border crossings have fallen dramatically, even despite the essential travel exemptions.</p>   <p>At the Peace Bridge between Buffalo, N.Y., and Fort Erie, Ontario, "passenger traffic [is] down 95%, bus traffic down ... 99.6%, so essentially, it's shut down," Kathryn Friedman, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Canada Institute, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/covid-19-and-northern-border?emci=49674dcd-8e7d-ea11-a94c-00155d03b1e8&emdi=bd84d781-977d-ea11-a94c-00155d03b1e8&ceid=196241">said in a conference</a> Tuesday. "Commercial traffic is down a little over 28%."</p>   <p>"It is surreal to see such little traffic," Ron Rienas, who runs the authority that manages the Peace Bridge, told <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/buffalonews.com/2020/04/14/the-new-state-of-our-border-eerie-surreal-ghostly-and-guarded/__;!!Iwwt!HlyPw2EpWEDv7UqXY7Hs2RxvPrQG-i-o0e_CituwSL12v7GLIHTZRIML2ZE$">The Buffalo News</a>.</p>   <div id="res837935162" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col ">

   <p>Since April 1, tunnel traffic between the heavily integrated Detroit and Windsor, Ontario regions is down 88% over the same period last year, according to Friedman.</p>   <p>Concerns have risen in Canada about daily trips by around 1,600 health care workers from Ontario to hard-hit <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/835553051/after-recovering-from-covid-19-some-detroit-health-care-workers-are-back-on-the">Detroit</a>.

   <p><strong>Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET</strong></p>   <p>Urged by President Trump, states across the country are beginning to eye the next phase of their response to the coronavirus: the cautious process of lifting their widespread restrictions, piece by piece, and returning to a semblance of daily life before the pandemic settled in. But how should that happen — and when?</p>   <p>Three broad coalitions of states — one on the West Coast, one in the Northeast and one in the Midwest — have taken shape to collaborate on their response to the crisis. Among them is Ohio's Republican governor, Mike DeWine, who is working with at least six neighboring governors in the bipartisan <a href="https://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=GovernorBeshear&prId=130">Midwestern partnership</a>.</p>   <p>"It's something that just naturally occurs," DeWine told NPR's <em>Weekend Edition</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/18/837855138/ohio-governor-on-states-banding-together-next-steps-for-coronavirus-response">on Saturday</a>, "and during this coronavirus, it's something that, you know, is even more urgent that we we do — that share these ideas."</p>   <p>Part of that urgency is coming from the president, whose administration has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/16/836489480/read-white-house-guidelines-to-states-for-reopening">released guidelines</a> for states considering reopening and who has targeted Democratic governors with tweets calling for them to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130">"LIBERATE"</a> their states. That handful of states includes Virginia, which Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine represents.</p>   <p>Kaine, in an interview with <em>All Things Considered </em>on<em> </em>Saturday<em>,</em> said he considers the tweets an attempt to "foment division in our country in the midst of a global pandemic," noting that the president is "urging them to protest the social distancing guidelines that his own administration is urging us to follow."</p>   <p>DeWine downplayed the president's tweets, saying he doesn't think Trump is calling for insurrection with the all-caps command to his followers to "liberate" their state from administrations led by his rival party: "You know," DeWine said, "to fixate on two or three tweets by the president of the United States doesn't make any doesn't make any sense to me."</p>   <div id="res837946561" class="bucketwrap twitter large graphic624" aria-label="Tweet">

   <p>Part of the urgency DeWine and his fellow governors feel is also coming from protesters, many of whom dressed in Trump campaign gear, who have flouted state social distancing recommendations and gathered at rallies not only <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200417/protests-over-coronavirus-orders-started-with-fringe-groups-but-now-include-ohio-lawmakers">in Ohio</a> but in a number of other states <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/18/837776218/across-america-frustrated-protesters-rally-to-reopen-the-economy">across the country</a>, as well.</p>   <p>Balanced against that pressure are the recommendations of health officials, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/836632548/coronavirus-latest-despite-trumps-optimism-there-s-still-a-long-road-to-reopenin">have warned</a> that easing social distancing restrictions and allowing nonessential businesses to reopen too quickly — without extensive testing and sufficient medical resources — will merely lead to another deadly surge in coronavirus infections. The U.S. has suffered by far the biggest outbreak in the world, with more than 700,000 confirmed cases and a death toll surpassing 37,000, as of Saturday afternoon.</p>   <p>In Ohio, which has reported more than 9,000 of those confirmed cases, state officials are aiming for a "phased-in reopening of the state economy" <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/resources/news-releases-news-you-can-use/covid-19-update-governor-dewine-discussed-states-plan-for-reopening-businesses-regional-coalition-formed">beginning May 1</a>.</p>   <p>DeWine said that the protesters "have every right to demonstrate" — but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be getting their way.</p>   <p>"I understand the demonstrators. They want to get the economy moving again. No one is more anxious to do that than I am, so I understand where they're coming from," he explained. </p>   <p>"But we also have to do it in a rational way. We have to do it in a phased way that protects human life and protects our medical institutions for being totally overrun. So this is a nuanced balance of things that we're trying to do here."</p>   <div id="res837885840" class="bucketwrap internallink mediapromo primary">

   <p><strong>Updated at 12:34 p.m. ET</strong></p>   <p>Orthodox Christians — 300 million worldwide — are observing Easter, their biggest holiday, this weekend. </p>   <p>It's a time when churches are full, their bells ringing as parishioners embrace and kiss after singing <em>Christ Is Risen</em> at the stroke of midnight on Holy Saturday. Blood-red eggs are cracked, and lambs are roasted as part of a giant family feast. <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Tra12g7OQ__;!!Iwwt!EZ4SXwd_Qnui0R4t3MP5khDUVU1qf2I1K22_BYrdTTzzcsvGEGv2IYY9Q3GX$">There's even dancing</a>.</p>   <p>But the coronavirus pandemic has shut down those celebrations in many Orthodox Christian countries, including Greece, Romania and Serbia<strong>.</strong> This year, worshippers may not even light candles from the "Holy Fire," the flame from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem that's flown in from Israel.</p>   <p>"This Easter is different. We will not go to our villages, we will not roast in our yards, we will not go to our churches. And of course, we will not gather in the homes of relatives and friends," Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters on Friday. "For us to continue being together, this year we stay apart."</p>   <p>Greece is on total lockdown this weekend. Greeks watched a livestream of Good Friday prayers from self-quarantine at home, skipping the Epitaphios procession, when an icon of the dead Christ in a flower-filled funeral bier is carried around the neighborhood. They also scrapped annual plans to drive out to ancestral villages and roast lamb with grandparents.<strong> </strong>(One man <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itbe1sde6Nc&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1qM7xmPpy0WmJpHMCMmxMeWEFdVnx8na2LzQjTXnXE4-EFTiwIDxDTtZI__;!!Iwwt!EZ4SXwd_Qnui0R4t3MP5khDUVU1qf2I1K22_BYrdTTzzcsvGEGv2Ie8yNzxg$">parodied what Easter lamb-roasting would look like this year</a>.) </p>   <p>Police are monitoring streets by drone and patrolling outside churches to make sure priests holding closed-door services do not let in parishioners.</p>   <p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis banned church services last month, after weeks of pushback from the Greek Orthodox Church. Mitsotakis' tough social distancing policies have been credited with Greece's success at fighting the spread of COVID19. (Greece has reported at least 2,235 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 110 deaths).</p>   <p>Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, has implored the faithful to follow government orders for their own health. But some Greek Orthodox priests have balked. </p>   <p>On the Aegean island of Chios, Father Christophoros Gourlis was arrested on Saturday and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.avgi.gr/article/10813/10967230__;!!Iwwt!H09_JRoZ9LT0eY6x_3Qyy3pGWBoTTcijiLpo05MwOco9s_1uRkdHaR9FRKFc$">fined more than $5,000</a> after opening his doors to parishioners on Good Friday. As police dragged away one woman trying to enter the church, the priest <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKAM8PykdeM&feature=youtu.be__;!!Iwwt!H09_JRoZ9LT0eY6x_3Qyy3pGWBoTTcijiLpo05MwOco9s_1uRkdHaQLQlmUc$">was heard yelling</a>: "This is an outrage! I came to bless you and instead you're manhandling a woman!"</p>   <p>Earlier this month, on another Ionian Sea island, Corfu, Bishop Nektarios was detained after allowing parishioners into his church service. He also gave worshippers communion using a shared spoon dipped into a chalice of wine, which increases the risk of coronavirus transmission. <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ekathimerini.com/251643/article/ekathimerini/news/bishop-of-corfu-to-face-trial-on-may-25-after-illegal-service__;!!Iwwt!EZ4SXwd_Qnui0R4t3MP5khDUVU1qf2I1K22_BYrdTTzzcsvGEGv2ITcyojm_$">He's set to face trial on May 25</a>, along with Corfu's mayor and a top city councillor, who attended the banned service. </p>   <p>Last month, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/greece.greekreporter.com/2020/03/22/greek-metropolitan-arrested-for-defying-coronavirus-liturgy-ban/__;!!Iwwt!EZ4SXwd_Qnui0R4t3MP5khDUVU1qf2I1K22_BYrdTTzzcsvGEGv2IVWlyWEN$">police on the Ionian island of Kythira</a> detained Metropolitan Seraphim after he held mass in contravention of the ban.</p>   <p>These rogue Greek clerics aren't alone. In Georgia, which declared a state of emergency on March 21, churches are ignoring restrictions and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jam-news.net/georgia-coronavirus-authorities-church-news-statistics-threat/__;!!Iwwt!H09_JRoZ9LT0eY6x_3Qyy3pGWBoTTcijiLpo05MwOco9s_1uRkdHaZWrmIB0$">holding crowded services</a>. In Ukraine and Bulgaria, churches remain open even as the government has urged the faithful to stay home.  </p>

   <p><strong>Updated at 2:14 p.m. ET</strong></p>   <p>The coronavirus did not stop the tradition of the Holy Fire on Saturday, the centuries-old ceremony held annually at the tomb of Jesus in Jerusalem the day before Easter on the Eastern Orthodox Christian calendar. But some adjustments were made.</p>   <p>Usually tens of thousands of pilgrims pack the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and surround the Edicule, the inner sanctum that houses the spot where tradition says Jesus was entombed and resurrected. </p>   <p>This year, no pilgrims attended. The church has been closed to visitors since last month, as all houses of worship in the Holy Land have shuttered their doors.</p>   <p>The ceremony was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74QUyXvm1Yw">broadcast live</a> to tens of thousands of Orthodox Christian believers around the world. Clergy from Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Coptic and Syriac churches were represented at the ceremony, with a few Israeli policemen standing guard.</p>   <p>A small group of clergy, some wearing masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, stood guard at the Edicule doors, sealed with wax. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Jerusalem, Theophilos III, did not wear a mask. He encircled the crypt, wearing a golden crown and vestments, while a lone clergyman chanted. </p>   <p>Then the patriarch removed his golden trappings and entered the tomb. Moments later, he emerged waving lit candles as church bells chimed. </p>   <p>The sudden appearance of the Holy Fire is said to be a miracle, taking place inside the tomb each year at 2 p.m. In normal times, the flame quickly spreads among ecstatic pilgrims carrying candles until the cavernous church fills with light.</p>   <p>Like each year, motorcades drove the flame in small lamps to Orthodox communities in neighboring Jordan, the West Bank, and Gaza. </p>   <p>Usually, the flame flies back with pilgrims to Orthodox Christian communities mostly in eastern Europe. This year, with air travel canceled and Israel banning foreign visitors, 10 empty flights took off from Tel Aviv carrying the Holy Fire to Orthodox Christian communities in Russia, Ukraine, Greece, Cyprus, Georgia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus, Poland and Kazakhstan.</p>   <p>Because of quarantine restrictions, Akiva Tor of Israel's foreign ministry said lamps carrying the flame were brought by motorcade to the airport and transferred on the airplane steps with no flight crew disembarking.</p>   <p>In Greece, the Holy Fire was greeted by a bishop and a 15-member band at Athens International Airport, but the flame was not distributed to churches this year as is customary, the Greek daily Kathimerini <a href="https://www.ekathimerini.com/251838/article/ekathimerini/news/holy-light-to-arrive-stay-confined">reported</a>. Greek authorities have banned church gatherings to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The flame was instead kept at the Athens headquarters of the Jerusalem Patriarchate.</p>   <p class="contributors-text"><em>Joanna Kakissis contributed to this report from Athens.</em></p>

   <p>With the front gates locked and the normal revenue streams in hibernation because of the coronavirus lockdown, zoos across the country are getting creative about how to raise money to continue caring for their residents. </p>   <p>At the Birmingham Zoo in Alabama, President Chris Pfefferkorn said it costs an average of $30,000 a day just to operate a zoo — to feed the animals, pay the staff and utility bills and provide medical care.</p>   <p>Those costs are normally covered in large part by ticket and refreshment sales and gift shop purchases. "It's roughly 85-90 percent of our total revenues throughout the year," Pfefferkorn said. "We're very dependent on the community and their support."</p>   <p>The Birmingham Zoo has filed for help from the federal government, as have other zoos nationwide. But they are also turning to the public to try to stay connected. The Shedd  Aquarium in Chicago tweeted a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/twitter.com/shedd_aquarium/status/1239661654629023747__;!!Iwwt!BNkItI1yZFNf7PX8d2B25pgktjicBv8Px2fY73tlqKqbnNgAFeeMHegSithLeQ$">video of penguins</a> Edward and Annie waddling around the visitor-less aquarium. </p>   <p>The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden is <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.facebook.com/cincinnatizoo/posts/10158183362530479?__tn__=-R__;!!Iwwt!BNkItI1yZFNf7PX8d2B25pgktjicBv8Px2fY73tlqKqbnNgAFeeMHeip3E8heA$">raising money</a> by selling newly-designed T-shirts featuring its star hippo, and is holding regular online fundraisers that have raised more than $100,000.</p>   <p>In Germany, one zoo director <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/coronavirus-zoo-feeds-animals-germany">said</a> this week that as a last resort, the zoo may have to consider killing some of the animals to feed to others. Director Verena Kaspari told the German Press Agency that the Neumünster Zoo near Hamburg has had to draw up a last-resort plan detailing which animals would be euthanized first, and in which order.</p>   <p>The Birmingham Zoo's Pfefferkorn said that won't happen at his zoo. "I'd get out on the highway and collect aluminum cans if that's what it took to keep our level of care at the highest for the animals," he said.</p>   <p>But Dan Ashe, CEO of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/coronavirus-zoo-feeds-animals-germany">told</a> Buzzfeed he doesn't believe it will come to that at any of the zoos accredited by his international organization. In the worst-case scenario, Ashe has said, zoos could transfer animals elsewhere.</p>   <p>Still, the AZA is helping zoos file for financial aid and urging its members to contact Congress to remind lawmakers how much zoos need financial help. And he's reminding the general public how worthwhile zoos are, especially for children who are stuck indoors. The AZA's website has a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.aza.org/livestreams-and-activities__;!!Iwwt!BNkItI1yZFNf7PX8d2B25pgktjicBv8Px2fY73tlqKqbnNgAFeeMHeiH6KZyqw$">calendar</a> showing what time zoos across the country are showing live zookeeper talks and educational videos about animals.</p>

      <p>State and local restrictions on religious gatherings, introduced as measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, have emerged as a top religious freedom issue and prompted a flurry of new lawsuits charging that such measures violate the First Amendment or state religious freedom statutes.</p>   <p>The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian advocacy organization, <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/10970">filed suit</a> in federal court Thursday against Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, arguing that her statewide shelter-in-place order discriminates against religious institutions.</p>   <p>On Friday, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed an amicus brief in support of a church in New Mexico that is challenging the governor's order limiting religious gatherings to no more than five people.</p>   <p>Similar lawsuits have been filed in Florida, Mississippi, Kentucky, Virginia, California and Texas.</p>   <p>The cases all involve the tension between the constitutional right of Americans to the free exercise of their religion and the demonstrated need to protect public health.</p>   <p>The Kansas case involves two churches that have continued to hold services in defiance of <a href="https://governor.kansas.gov/executive-order-no-20-18/">an order</a> prohibiting "gatherings of more than ten congregants or parishioners in the same building or confined or enclosed space."</p>   <p>The churches claim they are unfairly targeted, because restaurants and bars are exempted as long as they maintain six feet between tables and bar stools. (In some cases, state or local authorities have held that establishments serving food provide an "essential" service.)</p>   <p>"There is certainly a legitimate religious liberty principle that religious gatherings cannot be treated worse under the law than similar gatherings," says Holly Hollman, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. "This is more complicated, because of the changing nature of the threat that the government is trying to protect against."</p>   <p>The coronavirus is highly contagious, and people gathered in church may engage in behavior, including singing, that is especially conducive to the spread of the virus. In several instances, outbreaks have been traced to a single religious gathering.</p>   <p>The Trump Administration, which in the past has given strong support to religious freedom arguments brought by conservative groups, this week took the side of a church in Greenville, Mississippi, that had been ordered by the city to halt drive-in services, even as nearby drive-in restaurants were allowed to operate.</p>   <p>In <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-issues-statement-religious-practice-and-social-distancing-0">a statement </a>supporting the church, the U.S. Justice Department said, "The City appears to have thereby singled churches out as the only essential service ... that may not operate despite following ... recommendations regarding social distancing." The Greenville mayor subsequently lifted the ban on the church's gatherings.</p>   <p>In the New Mexico case, the church argued that religious institutions should not be subject to more restrictions than those imposed on essential businesses. In an order handed down Friday evening, the court denied the church's motion. "The public's interest in limiting the COVID-19 outbreak in the state, a compelling interest, outweighs the right to gather," the court concluded. </p>   <p>For the moment, the controversy over whether governments can restrict religious gatherings has taken priority over other religious freedom cases, which have more often centered on individuals or groups citing religious beliefs for their opposition to same-sex marriage, LGBTQ rights or artificial contraception.</p>

   <p>In an bid to help speed up the development of potential treatment options and a vaccine for COVID-19, the National Institutes of Health on Friday announced <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launch-public-private-partnership-speed-covid-19-vaccine-treatment-options">a new public-private research partnership</a>. </p>   <p>The new initiative will be spearheaded by the NIH but also include the Food and Drug Administration, other parts of the federal government and a list of 16 companies that includes some of the biggest players in the pharmaceutical industry. Among the companies participating in the effort are Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Merck.</p>   <p>"We need to have all hands on deck from every sector to speed up the process of identifying those treatments that are going to work and to get the vaccines also developed, tested, to make sure they're safe and effective in the maximum possible speed," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, in an interview with NPR's <em>All Things Considered. </em></p>   <p>The announcement comes after President Trump and public health officials on Thursday unveiled new <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/16/836489480/read-white-house-guidelines-to-states-for-reopening">guidelines for states to begin reopening the country</a>. Health experts say that in order to safely do that, there needs to be more testing, contact tracing and better drugs to treat COVID-19. Ultimately, for things to truly return to normal, an effective vaccine is needed. </p>   <div id="res837497380" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col ">

   <p>Collins also provided an update on testing of antiviral drug, remdesivir, and shared his thoughts on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the high-profile director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. </p>   <p>Here are excerpts from the conversation. </p>   <p><strong>There's a lot of buzz about an antiviral called remdesivir. </strong></p>   <p>Remdesivir is certainly, I think, at the top of most people's hopeful list, but not yet proven. Just to report, yesterday although not yet peer reviewed, that <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/antiviral-remdesivir-prevents-disease-progression-monkeys-covid-19">in a monkey model it looked as if this did provide benefit</a> for COVID-19. ...

   <p><strong>[A] question about one of the most prominent faces of U.S. anti-virus efforts, Dr. Anthony Fauci ... Have you come under any pressure to fire him?</strong></p>   <p>Absolutely not. He is a wonderful public servant, an amazingly smart infectious disease expert. He and I have a nightly phone call every evening to catch up on what's happened with his life down at the White House and mine trying to manage the NIH. He's the best ally I could ever have.</p>   <p><em>Listen to the full interview on </em>All Things Considered <em>at the audio link above.</em></p>

   <p>A pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., has became a hot spot of coronavirus transmission and now workers and their advocates say the company failed to communicate the risks of possible exposure and waited too long to implement safety measures. </p>   <p>At least 634 employees at the Smithfield Foods facility have tested positive. The facility normally employs 3,700 people, but has stopped meat processing indefinitely after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/14/834470141/how-one-city-mayor-forced-a-pork-giant-to-close-its-virus-stricken-plant">requests by the city's mayor</a> and South Dakota's governor. </p>   <p>In a statement to NPR, Keira Lombardo, the company's executive vice president for corporate affairs and compliance, outlined 17 steps Smithfield has taken to protect workers, including adding hand sanitizing stations, enhanced cleaning and installing plexiglass barriers at its plants. But she said the company is suffering from the same supply chain shortages as the rest of the country when it comes to personal protective equipment.</p>   <p>"We are doing everything in our power to help protect our team members from COVID-19 in the workplace," said Lombardo. "... We have been working to get these measures implemented for many many weeks, all day, every day. But we do not have a magic wand."</p>   <p>Taneeza Islam is the founder of the South Dakota Dream Coalition, an immigrant advocacy group working with Smithfield employees. She says some workers believed managers knew there were coronavirus cases before any were reported. </p>   <p>Islam spoke with NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em> on Friday about what workers at the plant are saying about the working conditions. Here are selected excerpts from the conversation:</p>   <p><strong>What have workers been telling you about what conditions were like inside this processing plant over the past month as this pandemic was worsening all over the U.S.?</strong></p>   <p>We understand from firsthand employee accounts that they were not provided any protective gear. They were not given any hand sanitizer. There was no social distancing occurring on the lines from at least before March 26, to when some measures like taking temperatures outside of the plant before employees had to come in, took place on Monday, April 6. </p>   <p><strong>And typically how closely packed together are workers inside a processing plant like Smithfield? </strong></p>   <p>We've heard from employees that they consider themselves to be inches apart. That lunchrooms held 500 employees at a time. And that was still occurring until mitigation efforts were being taken the week of April 6. </p>   <p><strong>Given the importance of Smithfield, which is a major part of the U.S.'s whole pork supply, do you get the sense that employees trust the company to take their health into consideration enough as they're deciding when to reopen?</strong></p>   <p>I don't believe they do. I think the first death of a Smithfield employee that just occurred has really shaken the community and employees as a whole. There's a strong sentiment that if proper mitigation efforts, proper PPE, proper social distancing, proper sanitizing, that it wouldn't have been this bad. We all understand that we can't eradicate the virus, but we could have curtailed [it]. </p>   <p><em>Listen to the full audio version of the interview </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/837511566/what-workers-are-saying-at-a-meatpacking-plant-closed-due-to-coronavirus-outbrea"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

   <p><strong>Updated at 6:44 p.m. ET</strong></p>   <p>Amid growing concern about the well-being of residents of elder care facilities, West Virginia officials are preparing to test every nursing home resident and worker in the state for the new coronavirus.</p>   <p>Gov. Jim Justice has issued <a href="https://governor.wv.gov/Documents/2020%20Executive%20Orders/Executive-Order-April-17-2020-Nursing-Home-Testing.pdf">an executive order</a> directing state health officials and the National Guard and to conduct the tests, including retesting those who've previously been checked for the virus.</p>   <p>"Our nursing homes, we all know, are the most vulnerable of all of our people," Justice said during a briefing on Friday. "This disease has a way of attacking the elderly."</p>   <p>The decision follows outbreaks at care centers nationwide, including <a href="https://wchstv.com/news/local/covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-ripley-nursing-home">multiple positive tests</a> at a facility in Jackson County, W.Va., this week.</p>   <div id="res837754490" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col ">

   <p>Justice expressed frustration at incomplete testing and inconsistent information he said was coming from nursing homes where outbreaks of the virus have occurred.</p>   <p>"I'm sick and tired of listening to the discrepancies," he said. "We've gotta go back and redo everybody."</p>   <p>A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request from NPR for data on the number of tests that will be administered in West Virginia, and information about the state's testing capacity.</p>   <p>No other state has required tests "on the scale of West Virginia as far as we are aware," said James Nash, a spokesman for the National Governors Association.</p>   <p>Elder care centers have been a major focus of concern as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/16/836014004/families-say-they-received-form-letters-from-n-j-nursing-home-as-loved-ones-died">numerous outbreaks and deaths</a> have occurred at such facilities. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/833838080/fla-governor-says-national-guard-ramping-up-coronavirus-testing-in-nursing-homes">In Florida</a>, the National Guard also has been brought in to help ramp up testing at nursing homes and assisted living centers.

   <p>As U.S. joblessness climbs, immigrant workers are facing a tough decision: pay rent and buy food or send critical dollars to family back home. </p>   <p>Fifty-one-year-old Anabel is struggling to do both. The Beverly Hills clothing store she cleaned four nights a week closed in early March. Holding onto the small apartment she and her husband share in Los Angeles is a top priority. </p>   <p>"We have had to cut back on food just to pay the rent," says Anabel, who asked NPR to not use her full name because she is undocumented.</p>   <p>Anabel usually sends money every two weeks to El Salvador where she supports her two adult children and three grandchildren. Last week, she says, she was able to send them only $50.</p>   <p>Anabel's daughter Elba Mariela, 30, is grateful for the money her mother sends. "I just think about what she's going without and if she has food," worries Elba Mariela in San Salvador, where she lives with 20 extended family members. Only one cousin is still working.</p>   <p>El Salvador was one of the first countries in the region to close its borders and quarantine residents.</p>   <p>In 2019, immigrant workers in the U.S. sent an estimated $150 billion abroad — half of it to Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Manuel Orozco at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington, D.C. </p>   <p>In Haiti, remittances account for a third of the economy. In Honduras, it's nearly a quarter.</p>   <p>Even in Mexico, where remittances represent a smaller share of its gross domestic product, the losses will affect 1.2 million households, according to Orozco.</p>   <p>He estimates that remittances to Latin America will fall this year <a href="https://www.thedialogue.org/analysis/migrants-and-impacts-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-remittances/">by at least 7%</a>, similar to the decline seen during the 2009 global recession.</p>   <p>The drop in dollars sent home by workers in the U.S. comes as Latin America faces <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/16/economic-policy-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-in-the-time-of-covid-19/">its worst recession in 50 years</a>.</p>   <p>For now, Ari, 33, a nanny in D.C., is still able to send money to her aging parents in Oaxaca, Mexico. Her employers are paying her during the shutdown, but they don't know for how much longer. </p>   <p>She, too, asked NPR not to use her full name because she is working in the country illegally.</p>   <p>Hopefully, the shutdown will be lifted soon, she says, "so we can go back to work and start sending money back home again."</p>

   <p>With few to no sporting events taking place because of the coronavirus crisis, sports journalism is feeling the crunch.</p>   <p>Vox Media announced Friday that it would furlough around 9% of its workforce for three months starting on May 1, according to a staff email from CEO Jim Bankoff obtained by NPR. Several of those furloughs are hitting the media group's flagship sports website SB Nation.</p>   <p>Staff writer Natalie Weiner tweeted out the news that she was furloughed, adding that she was "mostly hurting for my colleagues, who work harder than anyone and whose many years of loyalty to the site are being repaid this way."</p>   <p>Vox Media also owns websites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/">Vox</a>, <a href="https://www.eater.com/">Eater</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://www.curbed.com/">Curbed</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/">SB Nation</a>. Bankoff indicated in the email that editorial furloughs would only take place at SB Nation and Curbed. Several writers and editors at both sites, including SB Nation's only copy editor Sam Eggleston, are among the furloughed.</p>   <div id="res837532220" class="bucketwrap twitter large graphic624" aria-label="Tweet">
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sam was the only copy editor for an entire web site.

   <p>According to the staff email, many employees will also see pay cuts. The <a href="https://twitter.com/vox_union/status/1251174663222329346">Vox Media Union</a> said via Twitter that it fought for no staff cuts to take place and helped ensure that no furloughed employees would lose their health insurance. The union said hundreds of staffers across the organization offered to cut their own pay to save jobs, but Bankoff noted in his email that furloughs were financially unavoidable.</p>   <p>Plenty of furloughed staff members at SB Nation praised one another's work in the wake of the company's move. Editor Alex Kirshner tweeted that his co-worker Ricky O'Donnell is "one of the great bloggers in world history. I don't even care about the Bulls but his blogs about their front office are appointment reading because that kind of fine-pointed destruction is nutritious." Editor Spencer Hall also shared that writer Zito Madu is "an impossible human being who is as trainable as a concussed cat but fortunately ... is a beautiful writer who can make a story about literally anything sing." </p>   <div id="res837533133" class="bucketwrap twitter large graphic624" aria-label="Tweet">

   <p>It's been over a month since the coronavirus pandemic forced the Spanish government to declare a state of emergency and put the country on lockdown.</p>   <p>People haven't been allowed to leave their homes except to buy food and medical supplies or walk the dog. Anyone who breaks these rules faces fines of more than $1,000.</p>   <p>But children aren't allowed out at all, even to accompany their parents to the grocery store. Almost all other European countries allow at least some outside time for kids.</p>   <p>Patricia Silvio has been confined in her Barcelona apartment since March 14 with her husband and 5-year-old son Max, whose birthday party had to be canceled last month.</p>   <p>"The situation has been really hard," she told NPR over the phone.</p>   <p>Silvio is working from home for an events-coordinating company. Recently, her husband fell sick, showing symptoms of COVID-19. He wasn't able to get tested (testing is reserved for those with difficulty breathing or who have had a fever for longer than seven days), but had to isolate himself.</p>   <p>"It's been really, really complicated to keep the house in order, take care of the kid, take care of my husband," said Silvio. "And without the chance to go out and get my kid some exercise."</p>   <p>Silvio says she's lucky — the family has a small terrace where Max can play. However, millions of children in Spain live in apartments without outdoor space; others live in cramped spaces with large families. All these children haven't been outdoors since mid-March.</p>   <p>Various regional governments in Spain have introduced local laws that would allow children to go outside — as long as they're accompanied by an adult, wear a face mask (if they're over 3 years old) and leave their homes during permitted times. But these measures must first be approved by the central government in Madrid.</p>   <p>Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau said it was unfair that the strict rules are still in place for children, when other measures are being relaxed.</p>   <p>"If we can resume some economic activity with all the preventative measures in place, we should also be able to allow our children to leave their houses to go for a walk," she said.</p>   <p>Spain's Health Minister Salvador Illa told a press conference on Friday that the central government was studying the regional proposals to relax the rules for children.</p>

   <p>The continued spread of the coronavirus claimed yet another big event on the 2020 entertainment calendar this Friday, when the San Diego Comic-Con announced the annual entertainment and comic book convention would be postponed until 2021.</p>   <p>In a <a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci">statement on its website</a>, organizers said it is "with deep regret that there will be no Comic-Con in 2020," marking the first time in the event's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743341846/san-diego-comic-con-is-turning-50-heres-its-origin-story">50-year history</a> it would not be held.</p>   <p>"Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures and while we are saddened to take this action, we know it is the right decision," <a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci">said Comic-Con spokesperson David Glanzer</a>. "We eagerly look forward to the time when we can all meet again and share in the community we all love and enjoy."</p>   <p>The event, which was expected to draw more than 100,000 people, was scheduled to be held July 23-26. It will now take place almost a year to the day later, kicking off July 22-25, 2021.</p>   <p>Comic-Con — which launched as a small comic-book themed event — is now a powerhouse summer festival that attracts major figures from movies and television. It's one of the biggest fan events of the year; last year more than 135,000 people attended, and not just for comics, but for interactive experiences, signings and big announcements about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/21/743850249/comic-con-2019-day-3-cosplay-day-plus-yes-the-marvel-panel">the latest Marvel movies</a>.</p>   <p>SDCC officials said fans who bought passes for Comic-Con 2020 can either request a refund or transfer their badges to next year. The same offer is being made to the event's exhibitors.</p>   <p>Organizers also announced that a previously postponed event, Anaheim WonderCon — originally set for April 10-12 — will also be pushed to 2021. It will be held at California's Anaheim Convention Center from March 26-28.</p>   <p>The spread of the coronavirus has decimated the festival and sporting calendar, with many states implementing broad social distancing guidelines and stay at home orders that have shuttered all but essential businesses from operating.</p>   <p>In March, California governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/818764136/california-issues-stay-at-home-order-as-coronavirus-infections-rise">issued a stay at home order</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/11/california-public-health-experts-mass-gatherings-should-be-postponed-or-canceled-statewide-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/">banned gatherings of more than 250 people</a>.</p>

   <p>In the shadow of Israeli watchtowers and settlements, they have co-opted an emblem of their occupier and set up improvised checkpoints — to enforce a Palestinian Authority lockdown in areas where Palestinian police are not permitted to patrol.</p>   <p>"We do not imitate the Israeli occupation," activist Nasser Khatib insisted. "We call this a checkpoint of love and peace."</p>   <p>The activists, mainly affiliated with the ruling Fatah party, man the checkpoints to keep Palestinians from driving between towns during the day and off the streets toward nightfall, between 5 p.m. and 10 a.m.</p>   <p>"Hello, my friend. How's your health?" Khatib asked a driver on a recent afternoon. "Please wear gloves and masks to protect your health and the health of your children."</p>   <p>The strict lockdown has paid off so far. The West Bank has recorded fewer than 300 cases of infection and two deaths.</p>   <p>The Palestinian leadership, which usually has a 30% to 40% overall approval rating, enjoys 96% support for its response to the coronavirus, according to a <a href="http://www.jmcc.org/news.aspx?id=3819" target="_blank">recent poll</a>.</p>   <p>"The Palestinian government [does] understand that the health system here is very weak. So they took very tough measures," said pollster Ghassan Khatib of the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, which helped conduct the survey.</p>   <p>Beyond the West Bank, some areas are out of Palestinian officials' control. Israel claims Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem as a part of the Israeli capital and blocks any Palestinian political activity there. It has also blocked coronavirus-related activities.</p>   <p>Israeli police this week stormed a coronavirus testing site in East Jerusalem that was using Palestinian Authority test kits. Earlier this month, Israel stopped Palestinian disinfectant squads in the city with links to the Palestinian Authority. Police also said they <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-arrests-palestinian-official-east-jerusalem-69953121" target="_blank">detained</a> Palestinian cabinet minister Fadi al-Hidmi on suspicion of "Palestinian activities in Jerusalem."</p>   <p>"They broke the gate of my apartment, they used dogs," Hidmi told NPR. He said he was detained for several hours and questioned about an interview he gave from Jerusalem on Palestinian Authority TV about the coronavirus, before being released without charge. "The claim: that I'm leading the Palestinian efforts to fight corona in Jerusalem," Hidmi said.</p>   <p>Israeli police have said the arrest was not linked to efforts to fight the coronavirus.</p>   <p>In the West Bank, officials say about 75% of virus cases can be traced to Palestinian day laborers who brought the virus home from Israel, which has seen nearly 13,000 cases and at least 151 deaths. Now activists at the makeshift Palestinian checkpoints try to intercept the laborers on their way home, to ensure they are sent to quarantine.</p>   <p>Earlier this week, Israeli forces in Jeeps rolled past one Palestinian coronavirus checkpoint, using loudspeakers to order Palestinians off the streets for their own health. The "checkpoint of love and peace" vanished, its activists fearful of getting arrested.</p>   <p>Then the Jeeps retreated, activist Khatib told NPR, and he returned to his post.</p>   <p><em>Nuha Musleh contributed to this report from the West Bank.</em></p>

   <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada are reporting an influx of patients from Texas, after an order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott suspending most abortions in that state during the coronavirus pandemic. </p>   <p>New data provided to NPR by Planned Parenthood show a more than sevenfold increase in patients traveling from Texas to clinics across the Southwest for abortions since the order took effect <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/21/819356481/in-ohio-a-debate-about-whether-abortion-counts-as-an-essential-service">in late March</a>.</p>   <p>"It clearly shows that when individuals aren't able to access abortion care in their own state, they will travel — or at least the patients who have the means to travel will travel," said Dr. Kristina Tocce, medical director at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, in an interview with NPR.</p>   <p>According to Planned Parenthood, clinics in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada saw 129 patients from Texas between March 23 and April 14, compared with 16 Texas patients during the entire month of February, a 706% increase. During the same period in 2019, a Planned Parenthood official said those clinics saw 14 patients from Texas. </p>   <p>Tocce said she recently saw a patient who traveled 16 hours for a procedure. She said some patients are flying or making long drives at a time when <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/06/812650868/coronavirus-travel-tips-to-fly-or-not-to-fly-what-happens-if-you-cancel">travel is being discouraged</a> because of the pandemic. </p>   <p>"This really is frustrating as a provider because it seems to be putting patients at additional risk of being exposed to COVID themselves as they travel and risk them getting an infection, versus them possibly unwittingly transmitting COVID if they are an asymptomatic individual who's positive," Tocce said.</p>   <p>Republican state officials and organizations opposed to abortion rights <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820730777/anti-abortion-rights-groups-ask-hhs-to-urge-end-to-abortion-during-pandemic">have argued</a> that the procedure should be treated as nonessential during the pandemic, in order to preserve medical supplies for coronavirus patients, and to reduce the risk of exposure at clinics. </p>   <p>Tocce said her health centers are taking steps to mitigate those risks, including screening patients for symptoms, having patients wear masks at clinics and relying on technologies like telemedicine when possible.</p>   <p>Major medical groups say delaying abortion <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2020/03/joint-statement-on-abortion-access-during-the-covid-19-outbreak">can be harmful</a> to pregnant women. Abortion-rights groups have challenged bans in several states and have succeeded in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/834086810/federal-court-medication-abortions-can-proceed-in-texas">scaling them back</a> or blocking them, but some patients seeking the procedure <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/826369859/in-texas-oklahoma-women-turned-away-because-of-coronavirus-abortion-bans">have been turned away</a>. </p>   <p>A federal appeals court <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/834086810/federal-court-medication-abortions-can-proceed-in-texas">recently ruled</a> that medication abortions could continue in Texas, along with surgical procedures for patients approaching the state's 22-week cutoff. </p>

   <p>Boeing will start reopening its airplane manufacturing plants in Washington state next week, bringing 27,000 employees back to work under new safety protocols, the company said, even though customers are deferring and canceling orders for new planes.</p>   <p>The aerospace giant <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/828462989/boeing-and-airbus-halt-production-future-of-airplane-manufacturing-uncertain">shut down its factories</a> last month because of the coronavirus pandemic, and many workers feared the plants may remain closed for a longer period of time, with demand for aircraft plummeting as air travel comes to a near halt.</p>   <p>Customers canceled orders for 300 new Boeing 737 Max planes in March, and this morning, General Electric's aircraft leasing subsidiary announced it is canceling orders for 69 Max jets. </p>   <p>Boeing says it will restart production at its commercial airplane facilities in phases beginning April 20. Most workers will return the next day, and all the plants in the Puget Sound area are scheduled to reopen by April 24.</p>   <p>Boeing is implementing new safety procedures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, including staggering shift start times to reduce the number of employees going in and out of the plants at the same time. The company will also use floor markings to create physical distance between workers, and employees will be required to wear face coverings and other protective gear.</p>   <p>Among those returning will be workers preparing to restart production on the 737 Max assembly line, which has been shut down since January. It's a sign that Boeing expects regulators to recertify the troubled Max planes within the next couple of months.</p>

   <p>Von Miller, the defensive star for the Denver Broncos, announced he has tested positive for the coronavirus. That makes him the highest-profile NFL player — and the second active player this week — to publicly announce a positive test for COVID-19. </p>   <p>Miller is a former Super Bowl MVP and was the second overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. His diagnosis became public a week before the NFL is set to hold its upcoming draft without fans, players or league personnel in attendance, out of concern about the coronavirus.  </p>   <p>The Pro Bowl linebacker said he had been taking the spread of the virus very seriously and remained at his home in Denver for about four weeks. He "probably left the house four times" to get food, never leaving his car, Miller said in a Friday interview with <a href="https://www.today.com/video/von-miller-on-coronavirus-diagnosis-we-ve-been-taking-this-seriously-82202693515">NBC's Today show</a>.</p>   <p>"I was shocked," Miller said.  </p>   <p>"It all started with just a simple cough and it got worse. I also have asthma," he added. "My girlfriend, she was telling me that I wasn't sounding normal and I should try my nebulizer so I did ... I had waited another day — the cough still didn't go away."</p>   <p>Miller said he got tested two days later. </p>   <p>The Denver Broncos, where Miller has played his entire career, <a href="https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-release-statement-regarding-von-miller-s-covid-19-diagnosis">released a statement </a>on Thursday saying he is the first person within the organization to be confirmed to have the virus. </p>   <p>"After experiencing flu-like symptoms, Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller has tested positive for COVID-19. Von has elected to share his diagnosis publicly to emphasize that anyone can be afflicted with coronavirus," the Broncos' <a href="https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-release-statement-regarding-von-miller-s-covid-19-diagnosis">statement said</a>.   </p>   <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vonmiller/">Instagram story</a> posted to his account, Miller thanked fans for their support, adding, "I'm going to do whatever I have to do to get thru this!"</p>   <p>"'Take this seriously' It's definitely FOR REAL," he said. </p>   <p>Earlier this week, Los Angeles Rams center Brian Allen said he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He was the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29041840/rams-center-brian-allen-24-had-training-team-facility-tested-positive-coronavirus">first-known active player</a> to contract the disease, which has confirmed to have infected more than 680,000 in the U.S., as of Friday afternoon, according to a <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">coronavirus tracker</a> from Johns Hopkins University. </p>   <p>Allen's diagnosis came to light weeks after Sean Payton, the head coach for the New Orleans Saints, confirmed he had the COVID-19 disease. "Appreciate the well wishes. I'm feeling better and fortunate to not have any respiratory symptoms," he said <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanPayton/status/1240751764682522624">in a Twitter post</a> on March 19, adding the hashtag #BEATCovid.</p>   <div id="res837037168" class="bucketwrap twitter large graphic624" aria-label="Tweet">

   <p>Because of the spread of the coronavirus, all NFL facilities have been closed since last month and the league has <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001106539/article/nfl-announces-changes-to-offseason-program-due-to-covid19">indefinitely delayed</a> the start of teams' offseason programs.  </p>   <p>In a memo last week, the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001108454/article/2020-nfl-draft-will-proceed-in-fully-virtual-format">league sent guidance</a> for all 32 NFL teams preparing for the NFL Draft, originally scheduled to take place in Las Vegas. </p>   <p>"Clubs have been advised to prepare to conduct the 2020 Draft entirely outside of their facilities and in a fully virtual format, with club personnel in separate locations and able to communicate with one another and Draft headquarters by phone or internet," the league said.  </p>   <p>The draft is still set for its original dates, April 23-25. The upcoming NFL season, which starts in September, is currently scheduled to kick off as planned.</p>

   <p>Indonesia now has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in all of Southeast Asia, according to <a href="https://www.kemkes.go.id/index.php?lg=LN02">numbers released by the government</a> on Friday.</p>   <p>The Health Ministry in Jakarta reports 5,923 positive cases — following the country's largest daily jump of more than 400 new infections since Thursday.<strong> </strong>COVID-19 has killed 520 people in Indonesia. In the region, only China, where the novel coronavirus originated, has a higher death toll.</p>   <p>"Transmission is still occurring. This has become a national disaster," Health Ministry official Achmad Yurianto said on Friday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-indonesia/indonesia-reports-most-coronavirus-cases-in-southeast-asia-idUSKBN21Z14Z">Reuters reports.</a> </p>   <p>He also said testing has increased up to threefold in two weeks.</p>   <p>Indonesia's government has faced criticism for not testing earlier and for not swiftly implementing strict social distancing and travel restrictions.</p>   <p>Indonesia, which is the world's fourth most populous country, did not confirm its first cases <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/indonesia-finally-reports-two-coronavirus-cases-scientists-worry-it-has-many-more">until March 2.</a> Since then, cases have grown exponentially and on a daily basis, spreading to <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/10/covid-19-cases-reported-in-all-34-provinces-as-death-toll-exceeds-300.html">all 34 provinces</a> across an archipelago of <a href="https://www.embassyofindonesia.org/index.php/basic-facts/">some 17,000 islands.</a> Still, the first lockdown orders weren't issued until <a href="https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/indonesia-goes-soft-covid-lockdown-relieve-stressed-economy">over a month later</a>, and the restrictions only applied to the Jakarta capital region and its population of some 30 million. </p>   <p>This week, President Joko Widodo <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/indonesia-set-to-bring-34-million-people-under-partial-lockdown">expanded the restrictions</a> to some other parts of the country. He also advised the public to stay home during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts later in April. It's a big ask of the world's most populous Muslim country, as estimated 19.5 million people traveled for the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of Ramadan last year, according to Bloomberg News.</p>   <p>Experts modeling COVID-19 projections for Indonesia say the outlook is grim.</p>   <p>"It could be [another Italy] if the government intervention continues to be in the category of light to moderate and not high-scale intervention," Iwan Ariawan, a biostatistician at University of Indonesia, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3080292/when-it-comes-coronavirus-deaths-could-indonesia-be">told the South China Morning Post<em>. </em></a>The university predicts cases could soar to more than 1.5 million across the country, with more than 140,000 deaths.</p>   <p>Indonesia's latest case numbers mean the country has surpassed its neighbor the Philippines, which previously had the most known cases in Southeast Asia. The Philippines now has the second-highest confirmed cases in the region at 5,878, and Malaysia and Singapore are close behind, both with more than 5,000 confirmed cases.</p>

                A man carries a box of protective masks to emergency workers Thursday in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. The West African country has seen relatively few confirmed cases of the coronavirus to this point — but global health officials fear that won't always be the case.

   <p>So far, countries on the African continent have largely managed to dodge the brunt of the coronavirus. Even as the global pandemic has besieged medical centers in the U.S. and Western Europe, with a total death toll north of 100,000  in those regions, <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">all of Africa's confirmed cases</a> number in the thousands — most of which remain concentrated in just a handful of North African nations.</p>   <p>But global health authorities fear this won't continue forever.</p>   <p>"Anywhere between 300,000 and 3.3 million African people could lose their lives as a direct result of COVID-19, depending on the intervention measures taken to stop the spread," the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa said in a <a href="https://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/PublicationFiles/eca_covid_report_en_rev16april_5web.pdf">report released Friday</a>.</p>   <p>The problem, explained the U.N. agency, rests partly with the layout and infrastructure of some of the biggest cities on the continent, where the majority of the urban population lives in overcrowded neighborhoods without reliable access to hand-washing facilities. Couple that with relatively low supplies of hospital beds and the fact that 71% of the continent's workforce is "informally employed," according to the UNECA, without alternatives to work from home in the case of an outbreak, and it becomes clear that "the continent is vulnerable."</p>   <p>To calculate the impact of the virus, the commission referred to a computer model composed by researchers at Imperial College London, whose grim outlooks on the possible effects in other parts of the world have already proven <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/17/817214311/new-analysis-suggests-months-of-social-distancing-may-be-needed-to-stop-virus">widely influential</a>. In a worst-case scenario, in which governments do not intervene with preventative measures such as large-scale social distancing, Africa may see more than 22 million people require hospitalization and some 3.3 million die of COVID-19.</p>   <p>But even the best-case scenario — in which early and decisive measures save the lives of roughly 3 million people, according to the model — presents risks of its own. That's because the commission estimates that such sweeping rules would necessarily halt large sectors of the economy and push as many as 29 million people into extreme poverty — in other words, earning less than $1.90 a day to live on.</p>   <p>Vera Songwe, the UNECA executive secretary, says $100 billion is needed to "urgently and immediately provide fiscal space to all countries to help address the immediate safety net needs of the populations." Already, Songwe said in <a href="https://www.uneca.org/stories/without-adequate-protection-estimates-show-over-300000-africans-could-lose-their-lives-due">a statement Thursday</a> that countries in Africa have been suffering under the virus' fiscal effects, even if the physical ones have not yet made their full impact felt.</p>   <p>"The economic costs of the Pandemic have been harsher than the direct impact of the COVID-19," Songwe said. "Across the continent, all economies are suffering from the sudden shock to the economies. The physical distancing needed to manage the pandemic is suffocating and drowning economic activity."</p>   <p>Much of this economic devastation will be an "unavoidable" part of supporting the continent's medical response and preserving as many lives as possible — but at least some of it may be mitigated, the agency said, by "fighting the urge to impose export bans," temporarily halting debt collection and freeing up access to emergency funding and intellectual property on lifesaving supplies.</p>
