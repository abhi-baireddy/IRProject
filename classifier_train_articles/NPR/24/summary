The Birmingham Zoo has filed for help from the federal government, as have other zoos nationwide.
The Birmingham Zoo's Pfefferkorn said that won't happen at his zoo.
But Dan Ashe, CEO of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, told Buzzfeed he doesn't believe it will come to that at any of the zoos accredited by his international organization.
And he's reminding the general public how worthwhile zoos are, especially for children who are stuck indoors.
The AZA's website has a calendar showing what time zoos across the country are showing live zookeeper talks and educational videos about animals.
