Then they estimated the impact of poor diets on the risk of death from diseases including heart disease, certain cancers and diabetes.
(They also calculated the number of deaths related to other risk factors, such as smoking and drug use, at the global level.)
What would happen if everyone around the globe began to eat a healthy diet, filling three-fourths of their plates with fruits, vegetables and whole grains?
Perhaps that's why the authors of the new Lancet study say their findings point to the need for coordinated, global efforts.
