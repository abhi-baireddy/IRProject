Juan Felipe Herrera On Poetry In Tough TimesEnlarge this image toggle caption Beck Harlan/NPR Beck Harlan/NPRAs the United States Poet Laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera travels the nation reading poems to audiences in communities large and small, communities often starkly different from the U.S.-Mexico border region where Herrera grew up as a son of Mexican immigrants.
I'm concerned about those things," he said, "And I want my poetry to be concerned about it too."
NPR recently sat down with Herrera in a poetry reading room at the Library of Congress, where he has an office.
Herrera does much of his writing these days in airports or on airplanes, using leaky oil pens or, when he can, fountain pens.
In this one, called "Poem by Poem," Herrera offers a tribute to the nine black worshippers who were murdered by a young white man at a church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.
