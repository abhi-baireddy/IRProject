ET TuesdayJoe Biden has won the Wisconsin Democratic primary, garnering 63% of the vote.
In a statement Monday night, Biden thanked Wisconsin voters for their support, but blasted the decision to hold the vote as scheduled.
Another example: Biden won every county in Michigan several weeks ago, after Sanders won that state as well in 2016.
Biden won there as well, garnering 55% of the vote and 11 more delegates.
