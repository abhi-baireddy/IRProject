Obama To Serve More Home-Brewed Beer At White HouseEnlarge this image toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP Charles Dharapak/APDuring this year's Super Bowl, President Obama created a stir by offering guests at the White House beer that he'd brewed himself.
And now the president reportedly plans to have another batch of his homebrew on hand March 17 â€” that's right, for St. Patrick's Day.
"We have no record of beer brewing at the White House," Allman said, noting that even the gourmand Thomas Jefferson never actually brewed beer in the White House.
One word of warning: I haven't been able to independently confirm that the Obamas will serve the beer at St. Patrick's Day (!).
But this is what the White House's East Wing spokesman Semonti Stephens told Obamafoodorama:"It is very safe to assume that there will be more White House beer in the future."
