TV Adaption Of 'The Outsider' Takes Stephen King's Scary Story SeriouslyEnlarge this image toggle caption Bob Mahoney/HBO Bob Mahoney/HBOIf I had to make a list of the most important figures in pop culture over the last half-century, I would put Stephen King near the top.
Fear of madness and menstrual blood, fear of killer clowns and demonic pets, fear of addiction and entrapment.
Such fear takes the form of a slow-building dread in The Outsider, the new 10-part HBO series based on King's 2018 novel of the same title.
Where most thrillers and horror tales don't claim to be more than good trashy fun, The Outsider takes its story seriously â€” so seriously, in fact, that some viewers may find it pretentious or exasperating.
In the process, The Outsider captures the quality that has always given King's work its seductive power.
