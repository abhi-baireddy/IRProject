New figures released by the Department of Labor show 22 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March.
The New York labor department requires staffers to conduct phone interviews to certify eligibility for regular unemployment insurance or the federal PUA program.
A few days later, the state's labor department changed its process so that calls to applicants who still needed to finalize applications would be initiated by staff.
Once those guidelines were issued, Su said, the state's Employment Development Department began working on creating a new PUA program.
Independent contractors who file 1099s and other previously ineligible self-employed workers seeking aid through the PUA program will have to wait until mid-May, he estimated.
