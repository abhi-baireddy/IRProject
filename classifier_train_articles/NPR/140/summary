A Haunting Home Movie Inspired Lois Lowry To Write 'On The Horizon'Lois Lowry has written more than 40 books and won the Newbery Medal twice — for The Giver and Number the Stars — but she's never written a story in verse until now.
She was inspired to write On the Horizon after rediscovering old home movies.
One film, taken by her father, shows Lowry as a toddler playing on the beach in 1939 or 1940.
Lowry was inspired to write this book to explore "the connections that we all have to one another."
HMH Books for Young ReadersIn researching for the book, Lowry dug into the stories of the young men who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor.
