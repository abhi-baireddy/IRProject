"Anywhere between 300,000 and 3.3 million African people could lose their lives as a direct result of COVID-19, depending on the intervention measures taken to stop the spread," the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa said in a report released Friday.
In a worst-case scenario, in which governments do not intervene with preventative measures such as large-scale social distancing, Africa may see more than 22 million people require hospitalization and some 3.3 million die of COVID-19.
"The economic costs of the Pandemic have been harsher than the direct impact of the COVID-19," Songwe said.
The physical distancing needed to manage the pandemic is suffocating and drowning economic activity."
