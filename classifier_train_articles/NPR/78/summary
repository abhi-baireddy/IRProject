DeSantis said the four-person National Guard "strike teams" have already been sent to 93 such long-term-care facilities, where a total of 962 positive cases have been discovered.
"I am directing the Florida National Guard to create more strike teams to significantly ramp up testing in long-term-care facilities," he said at a news conference in Tallahassee.
According to an AP tally, based on media reports and state health officials, more than 3,600 deaths nationwide have been linked to outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term-care facilities.
And in the past few days, Leon County — where the state capital, Tallahassee, is located — disclosed 22 infections at long-term-care facilities.
