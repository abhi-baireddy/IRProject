House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., presented the plan to Democrats during a caucus call on Thursday, suggesting it was the best low-tech option at this time.
McGovern also noted the proxy voting plan would be temporary and just apply to bills being considered during the pandemic.
Last month, the House Rules Committee released a 23-page report that weighed the various alternatives to in-person voting.
The report found that proxy voting was a top alternative.
