Fact Check: Is Mail Ballot Fraud As Rampant As President Trump Says It Is?
"Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters" said Trump, during Tuesday's daily White House briefing.
Election experts say Trump is partially correct, that there is slightly more fraud in mail-voting than in-person voting.
But they caution that both can be done safely and securely, and that election fraud is extremely rare in all instances.
In Tuesday's briefing, Trump specifically referred to people collecting other people's ballots, what's sometimes referred to as "ballot harvesting."
