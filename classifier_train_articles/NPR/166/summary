Cameron Esposito And The Comedy Of ConfidenceThe opening track on Cameron Esposito's new album, Same Sex Symbol, is an accelerating and elegant display of something often in short supply in great comedy: confidence.
Just finally, my look sorted out, you know, my gender reflected to you accurately â€” my gender being 'fighter pilot.'"
And even though "fighter pilot" is a punch line, there's no punch line to the underlying idea that she is happy.
"Same Sex Symbol" is available as a digital download, and you can also hear Esposito as the host of the podcasts Wham Bam Pow!
(which is about action and sci-fi movies) and Put Your Hands Together (which is stand-up from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in L.A.).
