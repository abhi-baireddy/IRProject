Workers' Advocate Says South Dakota Pork Plant Delayed Action On CoronavirusEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Groves/AP Stephen Groves/APA pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., has became a hot spot of coronavirus transmission and now workers and their advocates say the company failed to communicate the risks of possible exposure and waited too long to implement safety measures.
Taneeza Islam is the founder of the South Dakota Dream Coalition, an immigrant advocacy group working with Smithfield employees.
Islam spoke with NPR's All Things Considered on Friday about what workers at the plant are saying about the working conditions.

There's a strong sentiment that if proper mitigation efforts, proper PPE, proper social distancing, proper sanitizing, that it wouldn't have been this bad.
