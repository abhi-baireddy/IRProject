Let Your Mind Fly Free With 'What It's Like To Be A Bird'Hide caption David Sibley's new book, What It's Like To Be a Bird, features illustrations paired with essays about what birds are up to, and why.
"Here's a golden crowned kinglet, right here," he said as he watched the bird hop from branch to branch.
The bird continued to stick around, something Sibley said was unusual.
"And whatever birds I ran across, whatever birds were cooperative, I would sit down and sketch," he said.
He turned those sketches into thousands of detailed paintings, published 20 years ago in The Sibley Guide to Birds.
