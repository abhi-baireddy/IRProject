"This is an important decision and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe," Trudeau told a news conference outside the residence where he has been living and working in recent weeks.
The extension of the border restrictions came after a week in which the governments gave mixed signals about the next step.
President Trump said on Wednesday that the Canadian border "will be one of the early borders to be released.
But the next day, Prime Minister Trudeau told reporters, "There is a significant amount of time, still, before we can talk about loosening such restrictions."
