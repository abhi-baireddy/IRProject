Such charges are a major source of surprise bills, and can be financially devastating for patients.
As the first wave of $30 billion in payouts began to hit bank accounts last week, health care providers were asked to sign an online form agreeing to the government's terms.
Some health care providers and others in the industry have fought tooth and nail to safeguard their control over what they can bill patients for care.
Congress has yet to pass any legislation on surprise billing, but debate over the practice continues behind the scenes.
