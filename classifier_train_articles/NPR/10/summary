ETIf China was responsible for the coronavirus outbreak, the country should face consequences, President Trump said at Saturday's White House briefing.
Trump has offered no evidence that the Chinese were responsible for the pandemic, but did say that a U.S. investigation into the outbreak is ongoing.
Trump said, referring to China's reported mortality rate of 0.33 per 100,000 people.
The U.S. mortality rate is 11.24 per 100,000, which Birx said is half to a third of other countries.
