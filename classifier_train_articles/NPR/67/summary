CDC Hospital Data Point To Racial Disparity In COVID-19 CasesAbout 1 in 3 people who become sick enough to require hospitalization from COVID-19 were African American, according to hospital data from the first month of the U.S. epidemic released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The study of about 1,500 hospitalized patients in 14 states underscores the long-standing racial disparities in health care in the U.S.
Overall, the report found that about 90% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 had at least one underlying health condition.
The most common symptoms at the time of hospital admission were cough (86%), fever or chills (85%), and/or shortness of breath (80%).
"We really do need to address" the health disparities that exist in the U.S., Fauci said.
