The shift in tone comes after both sides are facing mounting pressure to reach an agreement.
Republicans spent all week hammering Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats for holding up critical aid to small businesses.
McCarthy said heâ€™s heard from Democratic lawmakers who are growing restless and just want to pass the small business aid.
McCarthy acknowledged there could be a vote as soon as next week if they reach a deal.
Members in both parties have been promised that they will receive ample notice if they need to return to Washington.
