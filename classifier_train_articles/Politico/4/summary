The crisis has also brought about a resurgence of single-use plastics.
The European lobby group for plastic manufacturers wants the European Commission and member countries to delay upcoming regulations and to lift all bans on some single-use plastic items.
Some European retailers have banned customers from using their own containers for food in order to avoid contamination risks.
“Consumers seem to have gone to more non-perishable products, such as flour, pasta, canned food, UHT milk and cream, eggs, yeast and minced meat.
All this will potentially create a risk for food waste in other parts of the value chain and different product categories,” Pesonen said.
