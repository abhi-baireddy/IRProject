The aid agency, which manages about $20 billion in foreign aid each year, has just begun a leadership transition, with the recent departure of its well-regarded administrator Mark Green and his replacement by an acting chief.
USAID also has fended off attempts to slash its budget by a president deeply skeptical of the value of foreign aid.
A former ambassador and GOP lawmaker, Green managed to quietly steer the aid agency and even reorganize it without attracting much notice from Trump.
William Maloney, previously a paralegal specialist at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been named USAID’s White House liaison.
Meanwhile, the White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, is reviewing USAID’s deliveries overseas to see what can and cannot be provided.
