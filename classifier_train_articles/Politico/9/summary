Obama mostly stuck to his pledge not to interfere in the race, but in 2019 there was one enormously important exception.
When Pete told Obama that he was 99.9 percent of the way there in terms of endorsing Biden, I would say that Obama was encouraging.
Obama will soon make the case for Biden that Biden has had trouble making himself.
Just as Biden once helped Obama win over older voters worried he was too young and too inexperienced, Obama will now try to help Biden win over younger, more liberal voters who think he’s too old and too experienced.
And in the 2020 Democratic primaries, Obama — or at least Obamaism — prevailed.
