FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has acknowledged the need to ramp up testing, but on Sunday his tone was cautious: Having an inaccurate test is worse than not having a test at all.
Going forward, Hahn said on ABC’s “This Week,” “further ramping up testing, both diagnostic as well as the antibody tests, will really be necessary as we move beyond May into the summer months and then into the fall.” The doctor added that the United States has done more than 2 million tests, but stated: “We need to do more.
No question about that.”AdvertisementHowever, the diagnostic testing in the U.S. has focused on those with the most severe symptoms and has been administered to less than 1 percent of the population.
Hahn pointed to pressure on the supply chain as a reason for disparities in access to tests across the country — and why nations like Germany and South Korea are testing at higher rates.
