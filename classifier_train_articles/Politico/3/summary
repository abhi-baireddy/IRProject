Watching these events on television doesnâ€™t capture how surreal they really are, so on Monday and Wednesday, I ventured to the White House to see them up close.
It sometimes takes 20-30 minutes to drive the two miles from where I live in Washington to the White House in the late afternoon, but on Monday it took about five.
A White House staffer wielding another thermometer greeted me and other reporters as we arrived outside the door to the briefing room.
Before these daily events, the White House briefing room was essentially shuttered.
There are only 14 reporters allowed in the briefing room.
