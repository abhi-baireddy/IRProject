Senate Democrats on Friday called on the Trump administration to release a fuller picture of where billions of dollars in emergency small business loans have landed, as Congress remains deadlocked over funding the economic rescue effort.

In a letter to the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked for data on the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program. They're also seeking, numbers for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Emergency Grants Program, another troubled SBA facility intended to rush aid to small businesses hit by disasters.

Among their questions, they asked for a breakdown of Paycheck Protection Program loans disbursed by demographics. They also asked for the volume of loans disbursed to large restaurant chain operators that can receive loans even if they exceed the program's 500-employee limit. Shake Shack said Friday that it received a $10 million Paycheck Protection Program loan through JPMorgan Chase, even as the burger chain announced plans to raise $75 million in the stock market.
