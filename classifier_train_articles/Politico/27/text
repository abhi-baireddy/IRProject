The coronavirus is continuing to take a deadly toll on New Jersey's nursing homes and long-term care facilities with no signs of letting up.

Of the 375 nursing homes and about 200 assisted living facilities in the state, 384 are reporting a total of 9,094 Covid-19 cases and 1,530 virus-related deaths, state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said Friday.

The death toll in New Jersey is higher than in New York, where at least 1,135 people had died at nursing homes and adult care facilities as of Wednesday, according to the New York State Health Department.

"We've seen extreme vulnerability of long-term care facilities in New Jersey and nationally," Persichilli said during the daily coronavirus briefing in Trenton. "We continue to be vigilant and do everything in our power to assist these facilities, from shipping personal protective equipment to connecting facilities to staffing support to replace the certified nursing assistants who are either ill or who have not reported to work."

Since the first Covid-19 case was reported in New Jersey early last month, there have been 78,467 positive cases and 3,840 deaths. Both totals are the second-most of any state.

Persichill said 111 long-term care facilities have reported that they are no longer admitting residents because they are unable to cohort and appropriately care for them. Last week, the state announced preliminary plans to begin moving residents in an effort to stave off the pandemic's spread.

That plan quickly became complicated as the nursing home death toll skyrocketed.

On Thursday, Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced that the administration had launched an investigation into Sussex County's Andover Subacute and Rehab Center — the state’s largest licensed facility — after 17 bodies were found in a small morgue on-site.

Murphy on Friday called the situation an "outrage."

“You’ve got a vulnerable population, a deadly virus and if that weren’t enough you have some folks who are not doing what they should be doing or need to be doing,” Murphy said, taking facility operators to task. “We expect them to adhere to the code of conduct that [they] have signed on to.”

The virus' spread in the state's three veterans homes is also worsening.

Of the 782 residents in the three veterans homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland, 145 have tested positive for Covid-19, 32 are hospitalized and 57 have died. Among the 1,331 total staff members, 70 have tested positive.

State psychiatric hospitals also reported additional deaths on Friday, bringing that total to seven from their population of 1,400.
