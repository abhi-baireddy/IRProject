As it happens, the United States could have significant leverage to make these things happen.
The United States and its allies have been the top contributors to the WHO: The United States alone has provided roughly 22 percent of the agency’s budget, compared to China’s 12 percent.
China also remains a distant second to the United States as the largest financial contributor to the U.N. system overall.
Covid-19 has shown the folly of expecting international organizations to stand up to China when the world’s leading democracy abdicates its global leadership.
Countries are thirsting for meaningful alternatives to Chinese leadership, and would rally behind the United States if decides to reengage with the U.N.
