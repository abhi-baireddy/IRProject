Prince William and Kate are opening up about what it's like following stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic and homeschooling their three children.
“Yeah, homeschooling is fun,” William said with a laugh, in a new interview with BBC.
“The experiences that front line workers are going through now is like nothing that anyone has ever seen,” added William.
Last month, William and Kate shared a video of George, Charlotte and Louis cheering for the health care workers.
