Election officials are seeking to minimize the health risks associated with COVID-19 either by moving contests or implementing alternative tactics to in-person voting.
West Virginia was the fifteenth state to announce it will delay its primary due to concerns over the coronavirus.
In the last couple of days, both Pennsylvania and New York, the last of the Acela primary states, which were scheduled to hold contests on April 28, have delayed their primaries until June.
In most of the states, election officials overseeing the contests have officially announced a new date, while some remain in flux with bills and lawsuits still being worked out.
More than 71,000 ballots have already been mailed to Democratic voters, according to the state party.
