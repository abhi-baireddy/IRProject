The administration has requested another $250 billion for the program, but a political clash between Democrats and Republicans has let the funding lapse.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to GOP accusations that she's holding small businesses hostage to her demands that they say are not immediate.
"In less than two weeks, the PPP helped over 1 million small businesses receive forgivable loans.
Now, millions of small businesses are in limbo because Democrats refused to put aside partisan politics and fund this bipartisan program."
We think at the end of the day, we're going to need upwards of $1 trillion to satisfy the demand of the nation's small businesses."
