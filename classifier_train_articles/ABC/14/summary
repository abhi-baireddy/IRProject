President Donald Trump's plan to reopen the American economy after a near-total shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic consists of three graduated phases, according to a copy of the proposed actions obtained by ABC News.
It calls on all vulnerable individuals to "shelter in place," and when in public, all individuals should continue social distancing.
Large venues, including churches and gyms, can open if they operate under “strict” social distancing and sanitation protocols.
The third phase says all these venues -- bars, gyms and large venues -- can reopen with “limited” social distancing and “standard” sanitation.
