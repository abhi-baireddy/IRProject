As the coronavirus pandemic forces people around the world to stay inside, streaming platforms, including Netflix and YouTube, have been forced to throttle video quality in Europe amid unprecedented demand, and YouTube said that it will now begin doing the same globally.
Google-owned YouTube confirmed Tuesday that it is temporarily defaulting all traffic globally to "standard definition" video quality.
Users can still opt-in to high definition quality, but by default they will be viewing the lower quality video content.
"If you are particularly tuned into video quality you may notice a very slight decrease in quality within each resolution," Florance added.
"But you will still get the video quality you paid for."
