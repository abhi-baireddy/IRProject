Now some areas of Florida are beginning to reopen them with restrictions: no sunbathing, no sitting in folding chairs, no coolers.
It was exactly what you would have wanted to see on your beach if you decided to open the beaches today,” Sweeny said.
“There were no beach chairs.”To be clear, the state of Florida never closed the beaches along its 1,350 miles (2,173 kilometers) of shoreline, except in South Florida — a hot spot for coronavirus infections.
After that order, Volusia County, home to the famed Daytona Beach, opened its beaches with restrictions on April 4.
But on Friday, a reporter asked DeSantis about Duval County reopening its beaches earlier that day.
