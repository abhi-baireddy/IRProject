Mom says giving birth during pandemic a 'blessing in disguise' "There can be positives from this."

A mom of a 2-week-old baby said that giving birth during a pandemic was a "blessing in disguise."

In a piece for Knoxville Moms Stephanie Lancaster wrote:

"One month ago, I was 38 weeks pregnant, full of anxiety, anger and fear. Hospital protocols were changing daily. Visitors were banned. Laboring women could only have one person with them. This isn’t what I pictured delivering my third baby would look like.

"This time, it was just my husband and I. The room was quiet. No chaos of visitors. The conversations were just him and I. Just the two of us for the first time in six and a half years. I’m just going to say it: delivering during the pandemic was a blessing in disguise."

Lancaster, a photographer in Knoxville, Tennessee, told "Good Morning America" the circumstances allowed her to be present at the moment.

"I was able to truly soak up every moment without thinking about who was coming, when they were coming, when they were leaving," she said. "We can't wait to share this new baby with family and friends, but right now it's been so great not having anywhere to be, literally nowhere to go and no schedule whatsoever."

She wrote in her post, "If you are a pregnant momma set to deliver during all the chaos of the world right now, rest easy. Take a deep breath. While this is probably not how you imagined your delivery, find the blessing through this mess."

Though the family doesn't have plans for a 4th baby, Lancaster told "GMA" she would "100%" restrict visitors on her own if they did.

Most of all, she hopes her post brings comfort. "It's so scary and uncertain right now, I just want to let them know there can be positives from this and to see the bigger picture and enjoy it."
