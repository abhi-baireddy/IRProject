Mom says giving birth during pandemic a 'blessing in disguise' "There can be positives from this."
A mom of a 2-week-old baby said that giving birth during a pandemic was a "blessing in disguise."
In a piece for Knoxville Moms Stephanie Lancaster wrote:"One month ago, I was 38 weeks pregnant, full of anxiety, anger and fear.
Iâ€™m just going to say it: delivering during the pandemic was a blessing in disguise."
Though the family doesn't have plans for a 4th baby, Lancaster told "GMA" she would "100%" restrict visitors on her own if they did.
