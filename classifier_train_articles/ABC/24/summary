Dogs and horses mimic each other during play, study finds Dogs interact with horses similarly to how they do with other friendly dogs.
Research on play between species may shed light on how capable each species is of detecting and interpreting playful actions.
In a new study, Palagi and her colleagues focused on play between dogs and horses, both intelligent, domesticated social animals that can recognize the facial expressions of humans and members of their own species.
The scientists found the dogs and horses both often displayed relaxed, open mouths toward each other, a common playful facial expression in mammals.
In the new study, they discovered such facial mimicry happened between dogs and horses roughly as often as it did between pairs of friendly dogs.
