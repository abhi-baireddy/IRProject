Does wearing a mask while traveling ward off illness?
With the recent outbreak, images from across the world show people wearing masks to ward off illness when traveling.
However, wearing a mask is not a practice the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for preventing infection in healthy travelers.
"There isnâ€™t a lot of data to support if there is any benefit to wearing a mask in the public setting.
"If someone has a cold or the flu or another viral respiratory infection, wearing a simple mask will decrease the risk of that person spreading infection."
