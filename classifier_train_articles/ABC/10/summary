Ariana Grande, Beyonce and more amazing performances from Disney's celeb-studded singalong Check out videos of some of the night's performances!
It was a musical night on Thursday as Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato, Luke Evans, Beyonc√© and other artists came together to entertain families across the country for "The Disney Family Singalong."
To make the singalong easier, lyrics to some of Disney's most popular songs were displayed at the bottom of the screen as a golden Mickey helpfully bounced on top of each word.
Interwoven throughout the performance were various heartfelt messages thanking first responders, from medical staff to grocery store workers.
Even Zac Efron dropped in despite weathering a bad connection to introduce the performance and remark on the song's newfound popularity and new meaning.
