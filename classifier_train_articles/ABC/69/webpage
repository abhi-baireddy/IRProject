Those we've lost come from all backgrounds and walks of life and include the very people -- first responders and medical staff, who are working so diligently to stem the tide of the infection and care for the sick. Variously described as heroes, caring educators and loving family members, they will never be forgotten.

Three members of an Ohio family -- Judith Conkey, her husband Lewis Conkey and their son David Conkey -- all died from coronavirus.

"My uncle passed away first and then my grandmother and my grandfather, they both passed the same day," Judith and Lewis Conkey's granddaughter, Katie Garbrandt, told ABC News.
</p><p>
"Everyone's deterioration went pretty quickly," she said. "My grandparents did know that they were in the same hospital and they could communicate by phone, but they didn't know one's condition one day from the next. And we didn't tell my grandparents when my uncle had passed away. They were on life support and we just we just couldn't do that."

"I don't know if there's a word to describe how close-knit we are," Garbrandt said. He said his grandparents were married in 1963 and "did everything together. ... They were always there for us."

"Take it seriously," Garbrandt said of the virus. "We want to spare any family we can from the trauma that we're going through. We can't have funeral the proper way. We can't grieve with our friends and our family.

"He dedicated his career to ensuring justice and security for those he served, and the impact he had on his community will continue to be felt for years to come. Rep.

Robinson died on March 29.
</p><h3>Dan Spector</h3><p>
Dan Spector was a Memphis artist who was gifted from an early age, his younger sister, Rachel Spector Peak, told ABC News.
</p><p>
After attending the Rhode Island School of Design, Spector launched a career in industrial design and started his own company for architectural molds and reproductions, Peak said.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineImage"><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><img class="" alt="" title="" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><figcaption><div class="InlineImage--caption"><div class="InlineImage--source-meta"><img class="Image Logo Logo__xs" alt="Rachel Peak" title="Rachel Peak" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><span class="InlineImage--caption-meta" aria-hidden="true"><div style="overflow:hidden"><span>Dan Spector</span></div></span><span class="Screen__Reader__Text">Dan Spector</span><span class="InlineImage--source-title">Rachel Peak</span></div></figcaption></figure></aside></div><p>
“I’m on overload right now," she said.
</p><p>
Peak said her brother's funeral was held online, which she said was a "tremendous help."
</p><p>
"It was very painful. I mean to watch your brother get buried by video – to watch your brother period get buried is painful," she said. "At least I was able to see him and I could hear the rabbi’s prayers and I could see the other people that were there, you know, on my iPad.”
</p><h3>Israel Tolentino Jr.</h3><p>
Israel Tolentino Jr. was a firefighter in Passaic, New Jersey, who came on the job in December 2018.
</p><p>
“He was liked immediately.  A wonderful, wonderful person. And he fit right in to that tour and made it his home," his fire chief, Patrick Trentacost, told ABC News. “We are family... we are there for 24 hours. We sleep there. And we laugh together and we cry together.”</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineSocial InlineSocial--desktop"><section class="ContentList"><section class="ContentList__Item"></section></section></aside></div><p>
Tolentino "was always happy to jump in” to do fire education at local schools, said Trentacost.
</p><p>
The chief said that what made it especially difficult was that they couldn't give him the full honors they normally would bestow on a fallen member.
</p><p>
"We did our best, but we had to keep our distance. We had to maintain our personnel in the vehicles," Trentacost said. "We have to set the example for safety. We have to set the example of social distance. And we did it. We gave as much respect and honor as we possibly could. Certainly we couldn’t go there and hug his wife Maria, who is a tremendous person. We couldn’t hug his kids."
</p><h3>James Villecco</h3><p>
James Villecco, 55, was an auto mechanic with New York City's fire department, most recently working in the ambulance repair shop.⁣
⁣
“Behind the thousands of calls our members respond to every day is a team of dedicated and skilled mechanics who ensure our ambulances are running 24/7,” said Daniel  Nigro, Commissioner of the FDNY. "James Villecco was one of those truly unsung heroes in our Department whose outstanding work provided medical care for the people of our city. The entire Department mourns his loss.”⁣
⁣
Villecco, who died on March 29, lived in State Island and served six years in the Army, the FDNY said.
</p><p>
He is survived by his wife, Joy, and daughter, Jessica.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineSocial InlineSocial--desktop"><section class="ContentList"><section class="ContentList__Item"></section></section></aside></div><h3>Bernard Waddell Sr.</h3><p>

“He’s going to be sorely missed," said Ron Edwards, director of the Hudson County Department of Corrections, <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/04/hudson-county-jail-correctional-officer-56-dies-from-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">according to NJ.com.</a> “He was more than just an officer.
