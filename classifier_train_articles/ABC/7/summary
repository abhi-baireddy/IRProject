USDA to try 'out of the box' solution to get food from farmers to food banks Farmers and food banks have struggled with disruptions from coronavirus.
“Our farmers, ranchers, we have, these are great people.
We also appreciate the additional funding from other sources to help deliver food from farms to food banks," he continued.
“We look forward to additional details about how the aid will be distributed.”The nation's largest operator of food banks, Feeding America, also applauded the announcement.
Along with the Farm Bureau, the groups have asked the USDA to consider ways to get food directly from farmers to food banks more quickly and expand SNAP benefits to Americans so they can buy food from local retailers.
