The urgent lesson for America's voters in the UK's 'disinformation election': Analysis The UK has been besieged by disinformation campaigns surrounding this election.
Answer: because three years after a Brexit referendum campaign bursting with half-truths, exaggeration and just outright lies, it seems the U.K. has not learned its lesson.
Both in the United States and here in the U.K., the focus has been on possible foreign interference.

Both U.K. parties seem to have been given licence to make claims that are untrue.
