More testing needed before states implement Trump's reopening guidance, experts say "I don't think any place is ready to start right now."
"Our best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of phase one reopening, if state governors should choose to do that," said Pence, referencing White House guidance.
But public health experts surveyed by ABC News, even as they praised the broad strokes of Trump's reopening plan, said testing shortages would prevent states from safely beginning the reopening process, describing the problem as one requiring a federal, not state-by-state, solution.
Leaving the issue up to states to solve for themselves could create inequities in testing capacity between states, the experts warned.
With many states concerned about lacking the testing required to monitor their populations, the administration has outlined efforts to help states expand their efforts.
