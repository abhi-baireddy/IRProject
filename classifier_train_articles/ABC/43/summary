Last responders: The grim job of medical examiners in the COVID-19 pandemic There are only 500 full-time, board certified forensic pathologists in the U.S.Just as first responders have been working hard to treat and prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, another group of medical staff have been working hard as last responders: medical examiners.
Medical examiners, also called forensic pathologists, are doctors who undergo intensive training to examine dead bodies to determine the likely cause of death.
What most people know about medical examiners comes from TV shows like "CSI."
There are around 500 full-time, board-certified forensic pathologists in the U.S., according to the National Commission on Forensic Science.
Some are motivated by the role forensic pathology plays in public health, as medical examiners report trends in causes of death, which shapes regulations that can improve public health and safety.
