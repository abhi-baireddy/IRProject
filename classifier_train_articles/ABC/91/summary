How novel coronavirus compares to SARS, MERS and other recent viral outbreaks A look at how COVID-19 stacks up against recent viral epidemics.
It seems like weâ€™ve been down this road before with SARS, MERS and the swine flu.
SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are all respiratory illnesses that are caused by the same large family of viruses called coronavirus.
