Coronavirus testing on the rise in US, but experts say itâ€™s not enough There have been over 6,600 tests administered in the country.
Officials in Washington, the state hit hardest by the virus thus far, have tested more than 1,300 patients.
California has tested more than 900 patients, while Florida, Oregon, New York, Illinois, Colorado and Texas have each tested more than 100 patients.
But experts say it's still not enough, with local officials continuing to scramble for additional tests.
"While testing options for COVID-19 have expanded, there still is frustration and concern that we don't have enough," one county health department in Washington tweeted on Tuesday.
