Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, called his impending prison sentence in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic "essentially a death sentence."
In an interview on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight" â€” Stone lamented, despite "egregious juror misconduct," he has been ordered to surrender in two weeks.
He faces a 40-month prison sentence after being convicted last year of witness tampering and lying to Congress.
Stone insisted, however, he felt the real reason he was prosecuted was he "refused to bear false witness" against Trump.
"I wasn't prosecuted because I was covering anything up for the president," Stone said.
