Michigan Gov.
Later on Friday, President Donald Trump, who has traded jabs with Whitmer over the state's handling of the outbreak, tweeted: "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"
Trump did not mention Ohio, whose Republican governor has set a similar target for economic reopening.
The chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, has criticized Whitmer, saying she was turning Michigan into a "police state."
The head of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce on Thursday urged Whitmer to revise her stay-at-home order, which he called too restrictive.
