When President Trump addressed the nation on Thursday, April 16, about ending the enforced national shut-down, he seemed oddly muted.
We will never know whether our self-inflicted wound was necessary, since we do not have a national control group, and, like President Trump, weâ€™re driven to rely on experts.
What we actually need, it would appear, is some way of evaluating the experts, some perspective in evaluating the unknown and the unknowable.
President Trump must now lead the way in reforming our politics, our academy, and our press.
He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and has taught at Rutgers University, the University of Virginia, and University College, London.
