President Trump needs to continue focusing the nation not only on these very important second things but also on American "first things," including our Constitution and federalism.
In the same press briefing, President Trump said, "We have a thing called the Constitution" as he explained, "We’re working with the governors."
Lewis coined the term, "The Principle of First and Second Things": "You can’t get second things by putting them first," wrote Lewis, "You can get second things only by putting first things first."
According to this principle, if a society only focuses on its very important second things, like money and survival, in the end that society does not achieve those second things and in the process loses its first things.
Lewis expert explained this "Principle of First and Second Things" more bluntly, using the most basic of all second things" to make the point, "The society that believes in nothing worth surviving for — beyond mere survival — will not survive."
