Reese Witherspoon had good intentions when she offered teachers fighting through the coronavirus a chance to receive a free dress from her clothing brand, Draper James.
The initiative was designed to show teachers gratitude by offering them "a free dress."
"I didnâ€™t receive an email either.
"We were so excited to reward 250 teachers across the United States with a free dress.
Draper James then encouraged followers to look out for Instagram stories of how "teachers are navigating the world of remote learning."
