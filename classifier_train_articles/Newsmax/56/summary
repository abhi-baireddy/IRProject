Kristen Wiig will take the lead role in Reese Witherspoon's TV comedy series that has just been snapped up by Apple, The Wrap reported.
Colleen McGuinness, who has worked on "30 Rock" and "Friends From College," will serve as showrunner and will also work alongside Wiig, Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter as executive producer, CNN said.
Taking on this TV role will mark Wiig's return to the small screen after appearing in seven seasons of NBC's "SNL" from 2005 to 2012, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Over the past few years Wiig has turned her attentions to features such as "Bridesmaids" and "Ghostbusters" so her return to TV is something to celebrate.
The tech giant has already clinched three series from Witherspoon, including a drama starring Jennifer Aniston about morning shows as well as another drama "Are You Sleeping," which features Octavia Spencer, CNN said.
