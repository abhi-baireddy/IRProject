Kristen Wiig will take the lead role in Reese Witherspoon's TV comedy series that has just been snapped up by Apple, The Wrap reported.

The 10-episode untitled series, which will be produced by Witherspoon's company Hello Sunshine, is the tech giant's first scripted comedy and is inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld's upcoming short-story collection "You Think It, I'll Say It."

Colleen McGuinness, who has worked on "30 Rock" and "Friends From College," will serve as showrunner and will also work alongside Wiig, Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter as executive producer, CNN said.

Taking on this TV role will mark Wiig's return to the small screen after appearing in seven seasons of NBC's "SNL" from 2005 to 2012, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Over the past few years Wiig has turned her attentions to features such as "Bridesmaids" and "Ghostbusters" so her return to TV is something to celebrate.

The Verge noted that Apple intended to invest at least $1 billion in original content for the upcoming year and, over the last few months, has added a string of new shows to its list.

The tech giant has already clinched three series from Witherspoon, including a drama starring Jennifer Aniston about morning shows as well as another drama "Are You Sleeping," which features Octavia Spencer, CNN said.

However, fans can look forward to an eclectic mix including a futuristic drama from the director of the "Hunger Games" films and a space series created by Ronald D. Moore from "Battlestar Galactica," The Verge said.
