New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday that a recent drop in hospitalizations and other improving metrics indicated the state may be past the peak of its coronavirus crisis and on a path toward stabilizing its battered healthcare system.
The governor said total hospitalizations of patients being treated for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, came to 16,967, a drop of more than 1,300 over the past three days.
Intubations and admissions to intensive care units also continued on their downward trend.
"On every level this is a terrible experience, Cuomo said.
"It is as tumultuous a time as we have ever seen."
