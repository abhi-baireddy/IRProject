It has been widely reported the U.S. and Canada had helped fund the Wuhan, China, virology lab that is believed to have accidentally released the global coronavirus pandemic because of lax safety protocols, according to U.S. intelligence.
Now, it turns out that $3.7 million grant was awarded by Obama administration in 2015.
"The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million," Trump told Newsmax TV reporter Emerald Robinson during the White House coronavirus task force daily briefing Friday.
The funding grant was award to the Chinese virology lab to research coronavirus pandemics, but intelligence reports the lab had been written up by skeptical U.S. officials for problematic safety procedures.
The Trump administration, which has already faced historic investigations since before he was even elected, has repeatedly been dogged by Obama administration officials, holdovers, and policies.
