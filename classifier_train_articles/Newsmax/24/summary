The coronavirus that has killed several workers and sickened hundreds of others at U.S. meat plants is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores.
As some slaughterhouses halt or slow output and buyers brace for more disruptions, meat prices are surging.
JBS USA delayed the reopening of a Pennsylvania beef plant from Thursday to Monday.
Last week, pork prices fell to the lowest since 2009, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Choice-grade beef prices climbed six straight days through Thursday, rising to $2.36 a pound, a one-month high.
