Harvey Weinstein is speaking out to media sources after a turbulent week that left one of the most powerful movie executives in Hollywood without a job and his professional and personal relationships in ruins.
Weinstein, cofounder of the movie hit-making Weinstein Company, was rocked by stories from The New York Times and New Yorker magazine detailing years of alleged sexual harassment and abuse claims.
Weinstein's wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced publicly that she was leaving him this week after the allegations became public, the New York Post reported.
Weinstein told the New York Post Page Six that he "fully supports" his wife's decision to leave.
He was fired from the company he cofounded, the Weinstein Company, in light of the allegations, the Post noted.
