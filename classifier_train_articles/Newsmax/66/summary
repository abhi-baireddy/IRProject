Actress Kate Beckinsale is the latest Hollywood star to come forward saying Harvey Weinstein harassed her, and she was just 17.
In a lengthy caption, Beckinsale claimed Weinstein called her to a meeting in his hotel room where he greeted her in a bathrobe and offered her alcohol.
Years later, she said Weinstein appeared not to remember the encounter and asked her if anything had happened between them.
Beckinsale did go on to star in several Miramax-produced films, including “Serendipity” and “The Aviator,” during the time when Weinstein co-owned the company.
Weinstein was forced out of his own company after The New York Times published an expose detailing many Hollywood stars he allegedly harassed, propositioned, or assaulted.
