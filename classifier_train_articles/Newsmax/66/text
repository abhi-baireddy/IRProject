Actress Kate Beckinsale is the latest Hollywood star to come forward saying Harvey Weinstein harassed her, and she was just 17.

Beckinsale posted her account on Instagram, with similar undertones to the other women who have recounted stories of unwanted advances from the film executive.

In a lengthy caption, Beckinsale claimed Weinstein called her to a meeting in his hotel room where he greeted her in a bathrobe and offered her alcohol. She said she declined and told him she had school in the morning, then left uneasily.

Years later, she said Weinstein appeared not to remember the encounter and asked her if anything had happened between them.

Beckinsale claims her rejection of Weinstein hurt her career, and that he would scream at her and call her names, saying, “Kate lives to say no to me.”

She applauded the women who came forward and said she hoped there would be a "new paradigm" where people don't get away with such behavior anymore.

“Let’s stop allowing our young women to be sexual cannon fodder, and let’s remember that Harvey is an emblem of a system that is sick, and that we have work to do,” she finished.

Beckinsale did go on to star in several Miramax-produced films, including “Serendipity” and “The Aviator,” during the time when Weinstein co-owned the company.

Weinstein was forced out of his own company after The New York Times published an expose detailing many Hollywood stars he allegedly harassed, propositioned, or assaulted.
