Academy Award-winner Reese Witherspoon revealed recently that she was "so confused" and "competitive" before she had kids and has mellowed out a lot since. Witherspoon, 37, is Elle magazine's November cover girl and opened up about what her transition to motherhood was like."I feel like I was so confused before I had kids, I almost got in my own way," she said. "Having kids made me clearer about who I was as a woman. I just wanted to exhibit good qualities for my daughter."The actress has two kids with ex-husband Ryan Phillippe — Ava, 14, and Deacon, 9. The couple was married from 1999 to 2007. Witherspoon later married Jim Toth and gave birth to son Tennessee last year."I was a little competitive before I had kids — probably really competitive, to be honest," she told Elle. "It really made me let go of that."Witherspoon also talked about what motivated her to launch her production company, Type A Films, in 2000. The firm merged with Bruna Papandrea's Make Movies in 2012 to create Pacific Standard, according to Us Weekly. "I started noticing a couple years ago that I wasn't seeing women as the stars of movies," she said. "I'm seeing them as the guys’ girlfriends, or so-and-so's wife. I just thought: God, if I don't start buckling down and start producing some movies, what's my daughter going to see in the movies?"Elle's November issue also doubles as its "Women in Hollywood Issue." Other celebrities who were highlighted along with Witherspoon were Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard, Melissa McCarthy, Shailene Woodley, and Naomie Harris.
