California reported 87 new deaths from the coronavirus outbreak, one of the highest daily fatality counts so far, as the governor says that the state may not be close to loosening measures imposed to curb the spread.
The total death toll was 1,072, Newsom said in his daily briefing.
The number of cases climbed 5.3%, while patients in intensive care fell by a “modest” 0.1%, he said.
“We have certainly flattened the curve,” Newsom said.
