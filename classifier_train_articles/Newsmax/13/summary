CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes confirmed in a statement to the Post, a "quality control" issue delayed getting the test kits out because they were delivering false positives.
"Only two of them got it right," a senior federal scientist involved in the development and study of the initial test kits told the Post.
The CDC violated their own manufacturing practices at a lab that was also handling synthetic coronavirus material, sources told the Post.
Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the initial failures, federal officials said, and the CDC acknowledged test kits had "a design and/or manufacturing issue or possible contamination."
"The first lot, they did not find any issues," the scientist who investigated the issue told the Post.
