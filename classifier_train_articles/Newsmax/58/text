Mayim Bialik was dressed down by critics of her Harvey Weinstein op-ed in The New York Times that some charged was victim-blaming, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.

Bialik, a co-star of the CBS hit series "The Big Bang Theory" and former teen star of the series "Blossom," wrote her New York Times op-ed, posted Friday, addressing the Weinstein situation in which she talked about "self-protecting" herself in Hollywood.

Weinstein, one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, lost his job earlier this month after he was accused by women in articles by the Times and New Yorker magazine of years of sexual abuse and harassment.

"I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise," Bialik wrote in her op-ed. "I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don't act flirtatiously with men as a policy."

She said women cannot be "na�ve" to the culture of Hollywood.

"In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want," Bialik wrote for the Times. "But our world isn't perfect. Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can't be na�ve about the culture we live in."

She concluded: "And if — like me — you’re not a perfect 10, know that there are people out there who will find you stunning, irresistible and worthy of attention, respect and love. The best part is you don’t have to go to a hotel room or a casting couch to find them."

The column brought criticism from some Hollywood stars and others, claiming that Bialik was trying to blame Weinstein's accusers for the actions of the movie mogul.

The criticism led Bialik to defend her column on Twitter, saying that her column was taken out of context.
