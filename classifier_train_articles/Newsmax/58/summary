Mayim Bialik was dressed down by critics of her Harvey Weinstein op-ed in The New York Times that some charged was victim-blaming, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.
"I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise," Bialik wrote in her op-ed.
"In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want," Bialik wrote for the Times.
@missmayim I have to say I was dressed non provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me.
