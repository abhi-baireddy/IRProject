Reese Witherspoon said Monday that she was assaulted by a director at 16 and that she had faced "multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault" during her Hollywood career, according to Elle magazine.
The Academy Award-winning actress made the charges during a speech at the Elle Women in Hollywood event, the latest revelation of sexual harassment and abuse charges made since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke two weeks ago.
Witherspoon talked about her experience before introducing Laura Dern at the event.
Witherspoon and Dern starred together in the award-winning HBO series "Big Little Lies" this year.
Revelations about sexual harassment and abuse charges surrounding Weinstein, one of the most powerful movie executives in Hollywood this month, were detailed in stories by The New York Times and New Yorker magazine.
