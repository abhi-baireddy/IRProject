The infection and spread of COVID-19 across the United States could be far greater if results from a new Stanford University study prove true.
The study used an antibody blood test to estimate how many people had been infected the the coronavirus in the past.
Other tests using nasal swabs or saliva test for the virus' genetic material, which does not persist long after recovery, as antibodies do.
Dr. Eran Bendavid, who led the study, told ABC News that around 95 percent of the Santa Clara population were still without antibodies.
Widespread antibody tests are instrumental in helping governments decide whether to return populations to work because those tests can help figure out who is less at risk, experts say.
