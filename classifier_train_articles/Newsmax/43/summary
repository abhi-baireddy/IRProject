I asked my friend Bryan: "What did you think of the president's news conference on the virus?"
It is clear from their conduct that many in the White House press corps would be good public relations agents for the Democrat party — as are many of their organizations!
While press corps reporters are hostile in their questions to the president, their colleagues have their own bias — have been rather reluctant to criticize China for expelling members of their profession from the country.
Shouldn't it be the American media and media around the world ferreting out where this plague began?
Americans are not as dumb as the major media thinks and can see right through its politicized charade on news coverage — especially by the White House Press Corps!
