Instagram’s founders, who have been mostly out of the public eye since leaving Facebook Inc. in 2018, introduced a website that gives live state-by-state updates on the spread of COVID-19.
RT.live uses a statistic called an effective reproduction number, which tracks the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person.
While the pandemic is global, Systrom said it’s more useful to look at the infection rate from a local angle.
Systrom and Mike Krieger, the Instagram founders, left Facebook in late 2018 after clashing with CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
While neither man has a background in health or epidemiology, the same statistical modeling that applies to fast company growth might also be useful for tracking virus growth, Systrom said.
