Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., has been tapped to assist in overseeing the Trump administrationâ€™s implementation of the trillions of dollars the U.S. government is spending to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic relief package in late March.
Pelosi in announcing the committee in early April said it was not an investigation of the Trump administration.
House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., will lead the five-person panel, which will have subpoena power.
Shalala joins Sen. Pat Toomey and Rep. French Hill, both Republicans, and Bharat Ramamurti, a longtime aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
