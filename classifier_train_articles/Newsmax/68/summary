According to one recent study by Careerbuilder, a staggering 80% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck, including 10% of six-figure earners.
And while average income varies widely across the country, so does the average cost of living.
The differences in leftover income highlights the vast differences in average income across the country.
On the other end of the spectrum, pricey but high-earning Bridgeport, CT had the highest level of leftover income, with nearly $1,700 left over from each paycheck.
After paying expenses, the average San Antonio resident had nothing left from their paycheck, while the average San Jose resident had nearly $1,300.
