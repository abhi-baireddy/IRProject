After two months as acting director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell has more than made his mark by carrying out President Trumpâ€™s directions to make American intelligence more efficient and less political.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has condemned Grenell for all of the above reasons but is probably more worried that the acting DNI will sharply curtail Intelligence Community cooperation.
More worrisome is that classified information is frequently leaked from the committee to damage President Trump politically.
Sniping from Rice, Brennan, Schiff and other Trump opponents will not slow Grenell down.
He previously held national-security jobs with the CIA, the DIA, the Department of State, and the House Intelligence Committee.
