A small group of Christian clerics celebrated the Holy Fire ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem on Saturday as the coronavirus pandemic prevented worshippers from taking part in the ancient and mysterious ritual.
The clergymen, from different Orthodox denominations, then circled around inside the empty church, chanting prayers that echoed off the walls.
In previous years, the church would be packed with pilgrims, each holding candles and passing the light around until it illuminated the centuries-old walls.
The ceremony, along with other events in the Holy Week leading up to Easter, was scaled back in line with a ban on public gatherings.
Israel says it made special arrangements with church leaders to allow the holy flame to be carried abroad to other Orthodox communities.
