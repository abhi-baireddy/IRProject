When the global coronavirus pandemic was ravaging China – well before the first death in the U.S. – the Trump administration was encouraging U.S. manufacturers to ship millions of dollars of face masks and other protective medical equipment to China in January and February.
The Trump administration had hoped the COVID-19 outbreak would be contained in China, using information provided from the country and the World Health Organization.
President Donald Trump had banned travel from China at the end of January.
"People right now, as we speak, are dying because there have been inadequate supplies of PPE."
"While China was silent on the seriousness of the crisis, they were quietly buying up a large portion of the world's global supply for masks and other PPE," Peter Navarro told the Post.
