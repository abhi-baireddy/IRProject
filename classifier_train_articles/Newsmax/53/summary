Phil Murphy, D-N.J., made an impassioned plea Saturday for Congress to pass direct federal coronavirus relief aid to states.
Without a "responsible bond program" from the U.S. Treasury, Murphy said his state is going to suffer "historic" levels of layoffs.
"There is one part of Congress that doesn't see the wisdom into putting direct money into states," Murphy said.
New Jersey would not be one that is ready, along with New York, which are the two most infected states in America.
Many other states run by Republican governors are closer to be ready to enter Phase I.
