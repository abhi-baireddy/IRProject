There is encouraging news from a University of Chicago hospital that’s participating in a clinical trial with Gilead Sciences Inc. using their experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir in treating severe COVID-19 patients.
Apart from the University of Chicago, there are 151 other locations globally participating in Gilead’s trial that involves 2.400 COVID-19 patients presenting with severe disease.
There are 169 other study locations, also worldwide, of a trial using remdesivir which includes 1,600 patients with more moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
While we anxiously look forward what data will be discovered from the other ongoing studies, we don’t want to make rash decisions too soon on its effectiveness and use for treating COVID-19.
