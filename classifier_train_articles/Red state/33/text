Investigative journalist John Solomon spoke to Sean Hannity on his radio show on Friday about the rather explosive statements made by Attorney General William Barr during his interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham last week that no one in the mainstream media has reported on. I was even surprised at how little attention many conservatives paid to what were extraordinary remarks.

As the two spoke, Solomon made reference to the fact that U.S. Attorney John Durham has been subpoenaing witnesses and that several have already appeared before the grand jury. (It was reported recently that Durham had driven down to Washington, D.C. in March because the investigation was ongoing, but there had been no reference to what specifically was the reason for his trip.)

Solomon said, “I’ve seen some evidence of the grand jury work [Durham’s] in the last four, five, six weeks. It’s been going on in the middle of the pandemic. And I think we’re going to get a better sense of what that looks like…”

Hannity abruptly cuts him off to say, “Well, that’s the first time you’ve told me that. What do you know?”

“I know of some witnesses that received subpoenas, I know of some witnesses that have appeared before the grand jury.”

Hannity asks if this is taking place in D.C.

“D.C. is my understanding,” replied Solomon. “They’ve got to build this case methodically and they have a good starting point. We know there was a crime clearly identified in the IG’s report. A [sic] FBI lawyer changed a document to deceive the court. They literally, fraudulently changed a document to deceive the court. That’s a crime. I believe they will start there and they will wind back. Why did that person do that? Who else was involved and who instructed that and what other intentional acts did we learn about that occurred in the same manner?

Hannity asks, “What about all the people that signed the FISA applications knowing that the top of a FISA application says verified and none of it was verified? What about the people who put their signature on it like James Comey?”

“Yeah. And Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein,” Solomon noted. “Every time you played that Rod Rosenstein clip on your show, you’re reminded, ‘Oh, we did this right. We did this right.’ Those guys lied to us when they said that. They did nothing right. Nothing about this was right. And last week, what did we learn. 29 out of 29 FISAs reviewed. All of them wrong.”

Solomon continued, “The FBI has not been following the law for a long time on this and there has to be a reckoning. I don’t believe that those people will be prosecuted for signing the documents. Now, there may be other questions, right? False testimony is an area that I believe Durham has been focusing on, based on the grand jury subpoenas and questions that I’ve heard. It’s possible that some of the people that gave false representations to Congress could get prosecuted for those false representations. That’s an area I’d keep an eye on.”

Who gave false testimony? We know that John Brennan gave false testimony on several occasions. Comey and McCabe lied to Congress as well.

Here is an excerpt from my post on the Bill Barr/Laura Ingraham interview. The post can be viewed here.

The Attorney General said, “My own view is that the evidence shows that we’re not dealing with just mistakes and sloppiness. There’s something far more troubling here. And we’re going to get to the bottom of it.” And he still considers the deep state’s assault on the President to be “one of the greatest travesties in American history.” These two statements, in my opinion, were the most important takeaways from the interview. Durham’s investigation has been going on for nearly a year, even longer by some accounts, and Barr remains convinced that the Democrats worked to sabotage Trump’s presidency. It’s easy for us to become discouraged and say ‘nothing will happen’ because, outside of a few leaks from the CIA or other similar entities, we never hear anything. But Barr’s response to this question reassures us that they’re on it and that nothing Durham’s team has uncovered so far has changed his mind.
