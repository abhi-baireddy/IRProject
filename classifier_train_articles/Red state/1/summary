FILE – This March 23, 1948 file photo shows a statue of Paul Revere in front of Christ Church in Boston.
The cornerstone of the church was laid in 1723, making it the oldest church in Boston, and it stands at the far end of Paul Revere Mall.
(AP Photo/Abe Fox, File)…Of the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,On the Eighteenth of April, in ’75:Hardly a man is now aliveWho remembers that famous day and year.
Old as I am, I don’t remember it either — it pre-dated me by about 193 years.
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,Through all our history, to the last,In the hour of darkness and peril and need,The people will waken and listen to hearThe hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,And the midnight message of Paul Revere.
