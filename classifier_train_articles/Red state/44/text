Democrats just can’t seem to stop being tone deaf to the havoc they have caused and they demonstrated it again today.

On Wednesday, we recounted how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) bragged about blocking refunding for the Paycheck Protection program that would have helped saved small businesses and rescued millions of American jobs.

The program had been authorized under the virus relief act, so Democrats had already agreed to the substance of it. But it was so successful, it was running out of money already to satisfy the great need. The Republicans tried to get another $250 billion passed to refund the program and continue helping people last week, just putting out a clean bill, just for the refunding. But Democrats blocked it, trying to add more things to it, in a ridiculous move. There was no reason to deny it other than trying to use the American people as hostage to get more of their pet programs.

Well, the money ran out on Wednesday the money ran out and now they’re not longer taking any applications. So if you’re trying to save your business or your employees jobs, you’re out of luck for now. Democrats couldn’t give a darn.

They beat it out of town. Democrat House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that the House wouldn’t be in session again until May 4, “absent an emergency.” Because a pandemic and millions thrown out of work isn’t an “emergency” apparently.

Pelosi gave an interview to James Corden of The Late Late Show where she had a Marie Antoinette moment, talking about how we “keep our spirits up during these trying times” showing off her expensive chocolate, her luxury double refrigerators and her freezer packed with designer ice cream that runs $12 a pint.

She also recounted how her grandkids were visiting her from New York and spoke about the “wonderful opportunity” they had.

Most grandkids aren’t getting to visit their grandparents and people in New York are under a stay at home order, don’t travel advisory.

Most Americans viewed these comments by Pelosi pretty darn clueless under the circumstances and there was substantial backlash on social media to Pelosi.

But today, the reaction of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Communications Director really took the cake.

.@SpeakerPelosi Pelosi having a banner week…

-gets attacked by Republican operatives for loving 🍦

-gets attacked by President Trump for RUNNING THE COUNTRY while he calls Coronavirus a hoax. The only Q: Which @jenisicecreams pint will she enjoy today as she saves the country. — Cole Leiter (@coleleiter) April 16, 2020

Translation? How dare you peasants be upset with her! You must be “Republican operatives!” They’re going to repeat the debunked hoax lie, while she’s doing the exact opposite of “saving the country,” denying millions a paycheck and destroying small businesses.

Not a good look, she’s thinking about what $12 pint of designer ice cream to eat while Americans are literally trying to figure out how they will be able to eat and feed their families.

She’s not going to lose her job and neither is Cole. Although she might lose her speakership after all this.

Why'd you leave out her other big accomplishment? pic.twitter.com/CabSe0n42R — Jordan Haverly (@jhaverly) April 16, 2020

Oh my gosh do you get paid for communications? — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) April 16, 2020

this…is a bad tweet and you should delete it. — Andrew Wagner (@andrewwagner) April 16, 2020

But they know they’ll get a pass and never be called out by the media which will blame Trump and the GOP.

But please, folks, let’s come together and through these folks out of leadership in the House come November.
