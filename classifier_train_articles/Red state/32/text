Joe Biden realized he can’t use a teleprompter for live TV interviews and boy has it upped the topic material.

After a bit of a lull, it’s been one clip after another the last few days. Just yesterday, I covered Biden attempting to do a hit for Morning Joe and how much of a disaster that was, his wife sitting uncomfortably by his side (see Joe Biden Went off the Teleprompter This Morning and It Was an Absolute Disaster).

I guess he’s overriding his handlers at this point, because there’s no way they’d otherwise keep letting him do this when it’s so unnecessary. But do it again he did, later that night on Anderson Cooper’s show, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s face was absolutely priceless.

OMG! What they are doing to Joe Biden is just pure evil. Let the man have his dignity. pic.twitter.com/2G22YbSBFm — Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) April 17, 2020

Here’s the full clip, which offers little via the way of clarification but a lot more cringe.

This is 5 minutes of torturous cringe. https://t.co/E7IfZcmJYF — David Edward 💤 (@_David_Edward) April 17, 2020

The oddity here is that Biden probably has a better shot at winning the election by just going away. The more he becomes “generic Democrat,” out of sight and out of mind, the more people will focus on Trump’s flaws and make the vote a referendum on him. Conversely, the more Biden keeps doing these interviews, the more obvious it becomes that he’s mentally degrading and isn’t fit for the office. Yet, he keeps doing them.

He appears to be all-in on the idea that he can handle this though. That’s good for Republicans — and good for your entertainment — but man is it awkward.

Regardless, he’s made this choice to be the nominee and there’s no holding back. If Biden wants to be president in such a state, voters can’t leave any issue on the table in attempting to stop him. That includes making an issue of his inability to complete a sentence.
