(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)Joe Biden realized he can’t use a teleprompter for live TV interviews and boy has it upped the topic material.
Just yesterday, I covered Biden attempting to do a hit for Morning Joe and how much of a disaster that was, his wife sitting uncomfortably by his side (see Joe Biden Went off the Teleprompter This Morning and It Was an Absolute Disaster).
But do it again he did, later that night on Anderson Cooper’s show, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s face was absolutely priceless.
What they are doing to Joe Biden is just pure evil.
