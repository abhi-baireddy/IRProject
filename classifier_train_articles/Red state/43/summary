(Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times: Media fact checkers need full time fact checkers to fact check their fact checks.
The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler is a shining example of a professional fact checker who needs one if not more than one person proofreading his work and analyzing it for mistakes.
He’s been caught in so many self-owns and erroneous fact checks that I’ve simply lost count.
The latest example from Kessler happend earlier today, when he posted a tweet that included a link to his latest fact check.
It was Trump saying the WHO said the virus was “not communicable” that Kessler took issue with.
