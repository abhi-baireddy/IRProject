Stand up comic and actor Patton Oswalt leans on a fence as he talks to the crowd at the Ebertfest Reception at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign president’s house in Urbana, Ill., on Wednesday, April 23, 2014.
This is usually covered with a sneering veneer of elitist snobbery and a comparison to greater sacrifices throughout history.

It’s a choice Patton Oswalt hasn’t been faced with in a long, long time, and it shows.
