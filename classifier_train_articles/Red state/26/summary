Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks to local residents during a community event, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2019, in Burlington, Iowa.

The latest entrant to confirm their politically selective “outrage” on the issue of sexual assault allegations is CNN, who finally managed to “report” on the story weeks after it first broke, in stark contrast to the more than 700 real-time pieces they did on the allegations against Kavanaugh.
But did they frame it as a detailed examination of the facts as we know them so far?
