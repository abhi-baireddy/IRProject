SCOOP @CBSNews obtains newly declassified footnotes IG report w/multiple warnings to FBI about dossier, Russian targeting, disinformation.
Per The Daily Caller, one of the sources was not only a fan of Hillary Clinton and clearly compromised politically, but he also had contacts directly with the Kremlin.
A source of information for the Steele dossier had contacts with a Kremlin insider in early summer 2016, and also voiced “strong support” for Hillary Clinton, according to information declassified Wednesday.
Try to imagine the reaction if this had been Donald Trump’s campaign paying for a foreign spy to mine Russian sources.
I’ve written countless words on the Steele dossier, so I’ll digress early on this one, but the hypocrisy that’s been shown over this issue is just incredible.
