(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)In mid-March, President Trump announced his 15-day plan to shut down the economy.
The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel writes, “The goal of the shutdown was never to eradicate the disease—an impossibility absent a vaccine.
They are setting up impossible conditions so they can blame President Trump for each COVID-19 death that comes after the shutdown ends.
What’s missing from the White House reopening plan—and what is urgently required—is management of expectations.
Unless Trump were to commit a deliberate, egregious error, I think most Americans will see through the Democrats’ spin.
