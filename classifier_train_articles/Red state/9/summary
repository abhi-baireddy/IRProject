That year also saw 391 homicides in Philly, so the city is right on pace to tie that record.
Mr Nutter had brought him out of retirement when he began his term in 2008, and crime in Philly steadily declined: the city’s homicide rate dropped 37% and violent crime 31%.
In 2016, there were 277 homicides in Philly, a drop of three since Commissioner Ramsey’s last full year.
The crime rate in foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy Philadelphia is due to the choices the people of the city have made.
They allow the criminals safe haven in their own neighborhoods, and treat drug abuse as no crime at all.
