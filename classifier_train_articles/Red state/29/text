Paul Revere received a $400,000 earmark in the Omnibus Spending bill — well at least his house did. The Paul Revere House received an earmark, thanks to Congressman Mike Capuano (D-MA). It is ironic that the Tea Party movement has risen up to fight against out of control government spending, yet the elites in Washington, DC think it appropriate to soil the name of an American Patriot by funnelling federal money to the Paul Revere House.

Here are three Massachusetts Earmarks that will make your head spin:

Spalding House, Lowell – $125K – Requested by Congressman John Olver (D-MA) and Niki Tsongas (D-MA) Paul Revere House – $400,000 – Requested by Congressman Capuano Lightship Museum Nantucket, Boston – $275,000 – Senator John Kerry (D-MA)

Paul Revere is the famous Patriot who fought in the battles of Lexington and Concord. Historians believe that he was at the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Revere is best known for his midnight ride from Boston to Lexington to warn the Minutemen of the movements of the British Army.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love the Paul Revere House. I am originally from Massachusetts and loved to go there as a kid. It is a small house in the middle of Boston and the tour of the house does not take that long. They have a freedom trail that takes you through the city to the House.

To paraphrase the famous poem about the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere:

Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight earmark for Paul Revere’s house, On the fifteenth of December of one-zero; Hardly a man is now alive Who remembers that day when Tea Party Patriots could be hear yelling, THE EARMARKERS ARE COMING!!! THE EARMARKERS ARE COMING!!! THE EARMARKERS ARE COMING!!! And they are going to take all our money away.

Why do they need $400,000 of federal tax monies?
