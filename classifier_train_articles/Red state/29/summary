Paul Revere received a $400,000 earmark in the Omnibus Spending bill — well at least his house did.
The Paul Revere House received an earmark, thanks to Congressman Mike Capuano (D-MA).
It is ironic that the Tea Party movement has risen up to fight against out of control government spending, yet the elites in Washington, DC think it appropriate to soil the name of an American Patriot by funnelling federal money to the Paul Revere House.
Historians believe that he was at the Boston Tea Party in 1773.
Now don’t get me wrong, I love the Paul Revere House.
