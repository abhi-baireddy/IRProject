My mother asked me why, considering that almost everything being reported on cable news and in print media was depressing.
That said, there are the little everyday small blessings to be thankful for and appreciate, too.
I got the things I needed, and got some things mom and dad needed, too.
“What’s got you smiling so much today, mom?” I asked her, glad to see she was in good spirits.
“I’m seeing my girl,” she answered, looking at the screen as though I was literally right in front of her.
