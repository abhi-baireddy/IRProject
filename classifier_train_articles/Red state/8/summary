Dr Franklin: If I’m to hear myself called an Englishman, sir, I assure you I prefer I’d remained asleep.
I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.
But, as our third President said, there are times when a little rebellion is a good and necessary thing.
When Governors order the state police to stop cars with New York license plates and send the National Guard, the National Guard!
When Mayors order the police, fire department, etc, to break up church services and threaten to permanently close their buildings if the Do Not Comply, a little rebellion is most certainly in order.
