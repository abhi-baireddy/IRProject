President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House, Tuesday, April 14, 2020, in Washington.
Let’s not normalize this: the President of the United States is encouraging citizens to engage in armed rebellion.
The Washington Post is accusing Trump’s tweets of breaking the law because of course they are.
Perspective: Trump’s "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"
Further, to think that Trump said that word based on some grand plan to call for insurrection but to then be able to deny it later is to credit Trump with forethought he simply doesn’t possess.
