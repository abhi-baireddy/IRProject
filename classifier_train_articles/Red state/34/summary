Legendary actor/comedian Orson Bean, the father-in-law of Andrew Breitbart, was struck by a car and killed Friday night in Los Angeles.
It’s not a stretch to claim that Orson Bean is, in a large way, responsible for the rise of conservative media since he was the man who sparked Andrew Breitbart’s conversion to conservatism.
In the film Hating Breitbart, Andrew talks about the influence Bean had on his work.
Orson Bean began his comments by mentioning that he had already sought and gotten approval from the rabbi to tell the joke.
As Larry Solov wrote at Breitbart, Bean was an example of having the courage to “live your truth,” as the New-Agers term it.
