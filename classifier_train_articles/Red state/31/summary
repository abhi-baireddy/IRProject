This week’s episode of Homestyle features Leigh and I talking about one of our favorite hobbies, and usually, one of the first hobbies to get tossed aside when life gets crazy: reading.
We also discuss ways to get the kids reading and also getting them to buy into and analyze what they’re reading.
Whether it’s taking turns alternating pages with them, having them draw their favorite scene from that day’s reading, or just talking about it with them, getting kids engaged with reading is one of the best skills you can teach them.
