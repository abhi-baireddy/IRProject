This week’s episode of Homestyle features Leigh and I talking about one of our favorite hobbies, and usually, one of the first hobbies to get tossed aside when life gets crazy: reading.

In Louisiana, we’re now in our fifth week of sheltering in place, and there’s time during the day and after we’ve exhausted our kids enough for them to go to sleep to catch up on all that reading we’ve been meaning to do for the last six to eight months. For her, it’s the Lorien Legacies, and for me, it’s American Lion, a biography on Andrew Jackson.

We also discuss ways to get the kids reading and also getting them to buy into and analyze what they’re reading. Whether it’s taking turns alternating pages with them, having them draw their favorite scene from that day’s reading, or just talking about it with them, getting kids engaged with reading is one of the best skills you can teach them.

Here’s the episode:

The Homestyle Podcast is a joint venture between myself and one of my best friends, education reporter Leigh Guidry. Throughout each episode, we discuss cooking, crafting, and other hobbies as well as how we make sure to spend time with our families despite how insanely busy life can be. The goal of the podcast has always been to take a moment to focus on what’s really important because, at the end of the day, family and life is more important than whatever distractions are going on in the world around us.
