On Friday, the Indiana Election Commission got treated to a real doozy during their virtual meeting on the Zoom video platform.

As committee members, county and state election officials, and members of the media looked on, a stranger overtook the screen.

The invading party was an evident adherent of the age-old edict, “Scratch it where it itches, even if it’s in your britches.”

Maybe he’d had ants in his pants. We’ll never know — he wasn’t wearing any.

The takeover was quite dramatic — even Shakespearean.

Imagine the surprise: virtual attendees are watching business as usual when suddenly, well, to quote Hamlet: “Ay, there’s the rub.”

But to be clear, the hacker may not have been the whacker.

From The Northwest Indiana Times:

An unidentified participant took over the single screen shared among [the group] and used it to display a video of a man masturbating. A steady orange and black logo beside the steadily moving image suggests the recording originated on one of the most visited free pornographic websites on the internet.

The clip ran for a full minute before the commission’s web services manager was able to cut it off and remove the unwanted(?) user.

Election Commission Chairman Paul Okeson didn’t appreciate the unanticipated instructional. Once the rude, bare-skinned intruder was ejected, Paul commented on the naked jerk:

“That was sufficiently disturbing.”

Other comments were tweeted:

Apparently, crashing virtual meetings is nothing nude. I mean, new.

More from NWITimes:

The practice of “Zoombombing,” or outsiders using the video platform’s screen-sharing feature to display graphic content to invited conference participants, has become more prevalent as public and private meetings across the United States have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fortunately, everyone was still able to get down to the nitty gritty:

[The incident] did not stop the Election Commission…from ratifying the coronavirus related changes to the June 2 primary election agreed to Thursday by leaders of the Indiana Republican and Democratic parties, and GOP Secretary of State Connie Lawson.

Good for them.

We’d love to see the progamming perpetrator — who I must assume is male — brought to justice. Interrupting government business with vulgar content is absolutely not okay.

Someone should certainly be on the hook for such a repulsive act.

But for now, at least, it appears the guy got off.
