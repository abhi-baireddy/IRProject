On Friday, the Indiana Election Commission got treated to a real doozy during their virtual meeting on the Zoom video platform.
As committee members, county and state election officials, and members of the media looked on, a stranger overtook the screen.
From The Northwest Indiana Times:An unidentified participant took over the single screen shared among [the group] and used it to display a video of a man masturbating.
Election Commission Chairman Paul Okeson didn’t appreciate the unanticipated instructional.
Once the rude, bare-skinned intruder was ejected, Paul commented on the naked jerk:“That was sufficiently disturbing.”Other comments were tweeted:Most exciting election commission meeting ever.
