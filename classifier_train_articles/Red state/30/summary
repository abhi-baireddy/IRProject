(AP Photo/Nati Harnik)We all know that there is something mentally wrong with former VP and presumptive DNC pick for president Joe Biden.
WATCH: Joe Biden can't remember what he was saying.
I’m pretty disgusted by the way Jill, his wife, is allowing this to go on.
It’s on the DNC for putting this mentally ill old man in the arena, but Jill Biden definitely should receive the most derision for her unwillingness to guard her husband.
