California Assembly candidate Steve Fox, a Democrat running in the Antelope Valley area of northern Los Angeles County, didn’t get that memo, and apparently his consultants didn’t either.
On March 23 he posted this video, from the hospital lobby no less, claiming that since heat kills viruses people should use hair dryers to kill coronavirus.
In this video he didn’t really explain HOW to use the hair dryer, though.
Vote Steve Fox.
“They” should light into Steve Fox, who is far more deserving of their ire, for promoting these preventative measures as if they’re rooted in science.
