MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe took to the airwaves this morning to spread more discriminatory nonsense, this time by claiming that people who live in red states responded slower to the Wuhan virus because of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh.
Regardless, aside from there being no empirical evidence that Fox News viewership somehow makes people take the virus less seriously, the claim of state response is factually incorrect.
Was it all those rubes listening to Rush Limbaugh that caused that?
Another data point is that Ohio and Maryland are red states that acted very early because their situations demanded it.
