Perspective: Homeschooling during the coronavirus will set back a generation of children https://t.co/hNnx62PVLe — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 28, 2020Hyperbole much?
Set back an entire generation?
Unfortunately (but not surprisingly), the headline, “Homeschooling during the coronavirus will set back a generation of children,” is misleading.
Whether we’re discussing homeschooling or what’s essentially an online public school, writer Kevin Huffman’s conclusions are wrong – and that’s not just due to my experience.
But it has zero to do with “homeschooling.”To his credit, Huffman does list efforts undertaken by schools, teachers, and educational advocates across the country to make the best of our current educational reality.
