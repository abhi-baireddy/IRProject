Gretchen Whitmer to extend and expand the statewide eviction ban set to expire Friday.
Whitmer signed an order March 20 suspending evictions until April 17, allowing tenants and mobile home owners to remain in their homes even if they can't pay rent.
In Detroit, 36th District Court already extended its eviction freeze until April 30, the end date of Whitmer's current stay-at-home order.
"Every day the governor's office fails to extend the eviction moratorium creates more uncertainty and strain on Michigan residents."
Renters who are still employed are skipping out on paying, even though the state order doesn't change their obligation to pay rent, he said.
