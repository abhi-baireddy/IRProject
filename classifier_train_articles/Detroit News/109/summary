“I discovered, and I’m still discovering, that it is only by living completely in this world that one learns to have faith.
In so doing we throw ourselves completely into the arms of God, taking seriously, not our own sufferings, but those of God in the world.
That, I think, is faith.”Those words belong to the late Dietrich Bonhoeffer, German pastor and Nazi-opposer, martyred 75 years ago this month.
It was solidarity with a suffering God, for God enters the world in those who are hurting, the “least of these,” as Jesus called them.
“That, I think, is faith,” Bonhoeffer said, and I think so as well.
