"We know that this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people's health," Whitmer said from a press conference at the Romney Building.
"The sad irony here is that the protest was that they don't like being in this stay-home order, and they may have just created a need to lengthen it," Whitmer said.
The Wednesday protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, which told supporters to "come ready for a potentially major traffic jam around the (taxpayer-funded) Michigan Capitol Building."
He argued the governor should be allowing reasonable changes to the stay-home order to allow people to start returning safely to work.
