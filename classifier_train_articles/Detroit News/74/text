Mohamed Ali Saad, 32, has a history of mental illness and is considered armed and extremely dangerous, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement. The Marshals Service elevated him to major case status early Friday.

“The United States Marshals Service stands with the Dearborn Heights Police Department and will commit all resources to apprehend this fugitive, as we believe he poses a significant threat to public safety,” Mark Jankowksi, acting U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a statement.

Officials earlier said investigators suspect the woman's death in the 27000 block of Simone Street near Ford and John Daly roads is a homicide.

Officers were called to the home about 7 p.m. and discovered the deceased woman.

Investigators later learned Saad was last seen driving the woman's silver 2018 Jeep Cherokee Laredo and traveling east on Simone near Amboy, officials said. The vehicle's license plate number is DYV 2064.

"Saad has fled the Dearborn Heights area and is believed to be traveling through Ohio, possibly Dayton area," the U.S. Marshals Service said Friday.

Saad may be in need of medication, police said.

Anyone with information about Saad's whereabouts should call Dearborn Heights Police Det./Sgt. Tim Ciochon at (313) 277-7708, the U.S. Marshals Service at (313) 234-5656 or Crime Stoppers of Michigan at 1-800-SPEAK-UP. Tips can also be submitted online.
