Motorized boating is the latest item to be scratched off the list of allowed activities under Gov.
Just last week, the state website said “boating falls within the outdoor activities permitted under the order.”But the most recent update seems to drill down further and exclude motorized vessels.
Fishing still is allowed, but charter fishing isn't, and the DNR emphasized that "long distance travel is prohibited" except for critical purposes.
DNR boating access sites still are open and do not require a recreation passport.
Besides nonmotorized boating, just about the only outdoor recreation allowed under the order are walking, hiking, running and biking.
