Tallahassee, Fla. — A Florida man encased himself in concrete Friday outside the Governor’s Mansion in the state capital apparently to protest prison conditions related to the coronavirus.
Tallahassee police spokesman Kevin Bradshaw said the man, identified as 28-year-old Jordan Mazurek, put PVC pipes horizontally into two 55-gallon plastic drums filled with concrete, with some sort of mechanism that locked his arms in place.
Mei Azaad, a spokeswoman for the group, said they did not organize the protest but were aware of it.
“He refused to let go so we ended up having to use heavy equipment” to extract him, Bradshaw said.
They demanded that inmates in Florida prisons and jails be released to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
