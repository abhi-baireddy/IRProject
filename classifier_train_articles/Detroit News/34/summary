Detroit â€” President Donald Trump named Detroit and New Orleans as cities nationally that he believes are gaining ground in the battle against COVID-19.
"The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing," he said.
"Detroit is really started to go up and now it is stabilizing, and New Orleans is a great place ... it's really stabilized."
