Appropriately calling it a "business decision," Ann Arbor Pioneer dual-threat quarterback Conor Easthope announced Saturday that he has committed to playing at Harvard.
Easthope committed to Western Michigan last month, before backing away from that choice last week.

Before he committed to Western Michigan in March, Easthope had offers from another Ivy League school, Columbia, as well as Eastern Michigan, Central Michigan, Buffalo, Bowling Green and Toledo, among others.
