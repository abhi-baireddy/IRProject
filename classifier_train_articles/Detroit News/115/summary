Nashville, Tenn. – Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn only knew each other a short time before Cline’s death at the age of 30, but the friendship formed between two trailblazers of country music is enough to fill a book.
In this Feb. 10, 2016 file photo, Loretta Lynn poses for a photo at the Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tenn. Lynn's new book, "Me & Patsy Kickin' Up Dust: My Friendship with Patsy Cline," was released on Tuesday, April 7.
This cover image released by Grand Centra shows "Me & Patsy Kickinâ€™ Up Dust: My Friendship with Patsy Cline" by Loretta Lynn.
Cline showed Lynn how to shave her legs for the first time, taught her how to drive and gave Lynn dresses to wear on stage.
Lynn even has a pair of lace panties that Cline gave her as a way to spice up Lynn’s marriage.
