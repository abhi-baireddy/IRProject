Robin Seymour, who had most recently been living in Texas, was honored in Metro Detroit last year.
Following a start on WJBK-AM as a teen, Mr. Seymour headed to WKMH-AM, which later became known as WKNR.
Mr. Seymour was also open to playing diverse artists, embracing "sockhops" and catering to youths’ evolving tastes, said his daughter, Deborah Young.
“Looking back at it, I don’t know how we did it — five hours of live television, every week for seven years," Mr. Seymour once told The Detroit News.
Over the years, Mr. Seymour returned to Metro Detroit for multiple reunions honoring radio greats, including in September, when he also spent hours greeting hundreds of well-wishers while promoting his book, Seltzer said.
