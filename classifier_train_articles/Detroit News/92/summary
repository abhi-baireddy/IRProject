The Internal Revenue Service announced Wednesday it would send stimulus payments to Supplemental Security Income recipients, less than two weeks after Michigan Sens.
Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters had called for SSI beneficiaries to receive coronavirus stimulus payments without filing tax returns.
The senators had previously called on the Treasury to provide Social Security recipients the direct cash assistance included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Protection Act without having to file a tax return.
"Additional programming work remains, but this step simplifies the process for SSI recipients to quickly and easily receive these $1,200 payments automatically.
"However, many benefit recipients typically aren't required to file tax returns," the agency said Wednesday.
