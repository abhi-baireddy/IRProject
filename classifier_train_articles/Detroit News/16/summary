Beaumont Health issued notices Friday about a data breach last year that officials said could have exposed the personal information of up to 112,000 people.
The eight-hospital system launched an investigation and worked with cyber-security professionals immediately after learning an unauthorized third party accessed some employee email accounts, representatives said in a statement.

"A limited number of individualsâ€™ Social Security numbers, financial account information, health insurance information, and driver's license or state identification numbers were also contained in the impacted email accounts," Beaumont said.
The number of people who could have been impacted reflects less than 5% of the 2.3 million patients Beaumont serves, according to the statement.
