FILE - Guided missile destroyer USS Paul Hamilton is docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2013.
Naval Forces Central Command said the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of several American ships at close range and high speed.
In the group of U.S. ships was the USS Paul Hamilton, a Navy destroyer, and the USS Lewis B. Puller, a ship that serves as an afloat landing base.
The U.S. ships were operating with U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters in international waters, the statement said.
After about an hour, the Iranian vessels responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries, then maneuvered away.
