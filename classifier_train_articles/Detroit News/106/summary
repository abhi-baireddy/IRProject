The Idaho Freedom Foundation, a libertarian think tank and lobbying group, emblazoned its social media feeds with “Disobey Idaho” graphics and announced that it would host Friday’s rally along with Health Freedom Idaho and the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance.
It defies logic,” said Wayne Hoffman, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation.
Similar protests have been held across the country, with groups pushing back against stay-at-home orders in places like Michigan, Texas and Virginia.
Dozens circled Oregon’s state Capitol in their vehicles Friday to protest that state’s stay-at-home order.
In northern Idaho, Republican state Rep. Heather Scott referred to the governor as “Little Hitler” and compared the stay-at-home orders to Nazi Germany during the Holocaust.
