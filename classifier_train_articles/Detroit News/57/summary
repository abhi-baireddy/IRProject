A barge has been freed three days after becoming stuck in Lake St. Clair, U.S. Coast Guard officials said Thursday.
The tank barge Margaret out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, ran aground about 2 a.m. Monday on a soft mud bottom in American waters near Peche Island, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
It was with a tugboat and carrying 3.9 million gallons of diesel fuel, the maximum amount, according to the release.
The U.S. Coast Guard also coordinated response efforts with Canadian maritime officials to monitor the operations.
Approximately 936,600 gallons of fuel were transferred from the barge before it was freed late Thursday, the Coast Guard said in a statement on Twitter.
