Des Moines, Iowa â€” More than a dozen Iowa elected officials on Friday implored Tyson Fresh Meats to close their Waterloo pork processing plant, saying the coronavirus is spreading among workers and is endangering both employees and the surrounding community.
Workers build a large tent at the Tyson Foods pork processing plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, on Thursday.
Testing was completed Friday in Columbus Junction, where Tyson officials said two workers had died following an outbreak where at least 148 workers have been infected.
Reynolds said 2,700 tests were sent to the Waterloo plant and they will be processed at a state laboratory over the weekend.
State health officials said seven cases have been confirmed and the number is expected to rise.
