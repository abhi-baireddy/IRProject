Stone’s request “is a tower of indignation,” wrote Jackson, a Barack Obama appointee who was also attacked by the president on Twitter.
Jackson sentenced Stone in February to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress and tampering with a witness to protect Trump.
After his sentencing, Stone almost immediately requested a new trial, arguing the foreperson was a Democrat who was opposed to Trump and called the president racist on social media.
Stone also argued the juror had lied on a questionnaire to hide her bias and get on the panel to undermine the case.
Three jurors testified in a rare post-trial hearing and said there was nothing unusual or biased about their deliberations.
