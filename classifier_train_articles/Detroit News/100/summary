Washington — Some cities are preparing for a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the fall and winter by signing leases with sites for Army field hospitals that last through December, the head of the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday.
On the other hand, Washington state chose to close a field hospital due to lack of use.
One factor in a city’s decision on whether to extend a field hospital longer term may be cost, Semonite said.
Many of the field hospital sites have been established in city convention centers which hold events or large trade shows that contribute to the local economy.
For some converted field hospital sites, it might make sense to keep the beds in place for a while, he said.
