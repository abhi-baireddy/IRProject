Most international soccer might not be played until 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic travel restrictions and the need to give club competitions the chance to resume, a FIFA vice president said Monday.
CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani of Canada has been heading a FIFA working group formulating plans to deal with the implications of the world’s biggest sport being largely shut down since last month.
FIFA already has called off matches between countries that were due to be played in March and June.
Montagliani, CONCACAF’s president, believes the September, October and November windows for national team matches could be scrapped.
“If you take that across international boundaries, that’s a significant issue,” Montagliani said.
