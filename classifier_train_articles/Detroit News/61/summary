"To be clear: those who misallocated or misused training center funds betrayed our trust," Williams told thousands of union members gathered in Cobo Center.
The directive described by Adams Johnson stands in contrast to the reported actions of Williams' predecessor as UAW president, Bob King, years earlier.
Simultaneously, Fiat Chrysler officials filtered money through the training center to pay the salaries of "a large number of" UAW officials and employees who supposedly were assigned to work at the training center, the government alleges.
Prosecutors raided his home in November during the investigation, which has previously revealed that Jewell received a $2,180 shotgun purchased with training center funds.
Since that disclosure, Ashton resigned from GM's board and Estrada last month was transferred to replace Jewell as head of the UAW's Fiat Chrysler department.
