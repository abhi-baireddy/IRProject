The White House has intervened to weaken one of the few public health protections pursued by its own administration.
EPA pushed back on the White House demand for the loophole, known as a “safe harbor” provision for industry.
Asked about the White House actions, EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said in an email that “consulting with other federal agencies on actions is a normal process across government,” and that the White House often chooses to lead the process.
Emails sent for comment to the White House, the White House Office of Management and Budget and Beck were not immediately answered.
No authors are listed in many of the final rounds of White House edits, drafts and proposals and EPA’s responses.
