After designing his own treatment plan, a 92-year-old Wayne State University research doctor says he and his wife, also 92, are among the Michigan residents who appear to have beaten COVID-19.
Prasad said he was taking zinc as a supplement before he began having symptoms of the virus at the end of March.
But the doctor began to use a combination of zinc and hydroxychloroquine for treatment, which he described as a "powerful tool" for combating the virus.
A longtime friend of Prasad, Steve Bancroft of Franklin, described the doctor as gentle, kind and "non-self-promoting."
Three were eventually weaned off the ventilators, six stabilized but stayed on ventilators and three died, the doctor said.
