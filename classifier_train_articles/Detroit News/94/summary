Wagner Moura and Ana de Armas star in story of Sérgio Vieira de MelloUnited Nations diplomat Sérgio Vieira de Mello gets a respectful if muddled biopic in "Sergio," which presents its subject as a political Superman.
Ana de Armas and Wagner Moura in "Sergio."
(Photo: Netflix)Wagner Moura plays the Brazilian peacekeeper, known as "The World's Mr. Fix-It," as a guy so even-keeled he could make Barack Obama look like a hothead.

Yet its dry telling and skewed emphasis on his love life trivialize a man whose life was much more than skin deep.
