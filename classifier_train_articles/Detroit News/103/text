A man was walking on Cyman near Toepfer about 9:45 p.m. Thursday when a white Ford Crown Victoria drove north "at a high rate of speed," investigators said in a statement.

After the pedestrian "threw his arms up and motioned to the speeding Ford to slow down as it passed him," the car made a U-turn and drove back, according to the release. "The passenger of the Ford then approached the male citizen and began punching him repeatedly."

The passenger returned to the car, but the pedestrian stood in front before it "accelerated forward, striking the male citizen," Crime Stoppers said. "As the Ford drove away, the male citizen went over the top of the car and landed on the pavement."
