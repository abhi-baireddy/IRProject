President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion bailout package for farmers hurt financially by the coronavirus crisis.
The aid plan includes $16 billion in direct payments to farmers to boost their incomes, along with $3 billion in government purchases of meat, dairy products and other foods.
The combination of direct payments to farmers and bulk government purchases of commodities parallels the approach the Trump administration followed in its $28 billion agriculture trade bailout over the past two years.
The closing of restaurants, school cafeterias and other commercial food service operations has upended the market for agricultural products, particularly dairy, meat and produce.
Farmers are dumping as much as 8% of their milk, according to the Dairy Farmers of America cooperative.
