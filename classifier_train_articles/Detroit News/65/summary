The Department of Veterans Affairs is supposed to provide a safety net for the U.S. medical system in times of crisis.
Yet its hospitals have treated just 135 civilians afflicted with COVID-19, according to numbers released this week, even as coronavirus infections have pushed tens of thousands of Americans into the nationâ€™s hospitals.
By the end of January, a VA medical expert warned senior officials that the virus could devastate the U.S. medical system and economy and that VA hospitals needed more safety equipment.
The congressional relief bill passed in late March, the CARES Act, included $17 billion in additional funding for the VA to provide COVID-19 care.
The VA, which began virus screenings on March 11, said Monday that 1,530 of its workers have tested positive for COVID-19.
