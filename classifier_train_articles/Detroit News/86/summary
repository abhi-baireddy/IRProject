The bad news is Joshua Christopher, a five-star guard from Lakewood, California, won’t be coming to Ann Arbor next season.
Christopher committed to the Sun Devils over Michigan, Missouri, UCLA and USC in a video posted on Twitter and Instagram.
The Wolverines were viewed as the front-runner to land Christopher, who would’ve been the final — and arguably biggest — piece to the team’s 2020-21 puzzle.
Still, Michigan has its share of options to plug in at the two, where Christopher would've played a major role.
They are among five finalists for five-star forward Greg Brown, but Texas is the likely destination for the Austin native.
