(Photo: AP, File)As virus deaths mounted – with the U.S. reporting its highest one-day death toll yet at nearly 4,600 – the economic devastation from the restrictions is becoming even more shocking.
Britain’s official death toll, which is approaching 14,000, has come under increasing scrutiny because it does not include any deaths at home or in nursing homes.
The official death toll soared by more than half in New York City earlier this week when health authorities began including people who probably had COVID-19 but died without being tested.
The death toll in the U.S. topped 33,000, with more than 670,000 confirmed infections.
China raised its overall death toll to over 4,600 after Wuhan, where the outbreak first took hold, added nearly 1,300 deaths.
