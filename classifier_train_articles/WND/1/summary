The pro-life group Children of God for Life, which promotes ethical vaccines, found that several of the top COVID-19 vaccine projects are using aborted fetal cells, LifeSiteNews said.
In a letter to the president, they thank him for his defense of the sanctity of life, including fetal tissue and cells.
But they note that some advocate the use of fetal tissue for COVID-19 vaccine research.
"Notably, the few attempted transplants of aborted fetal tissue have made most patients worse, not better.
LifeSiteNews reported a vaccine developer owned by Johnson & Johnson is using technology derived from an aborted baby's retinal tissue.
