Trump first quoted Fox News' Sean Hannity as saying, "Nancy Pelosi, you are a weak person.
"She is totally incompetent & controlled by the Radical left, a weak and pathetic puppet," Trump tweeted.
Crazy â€œNancy Pelosi, you are a weak person.
"The truth is a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility.
A weak person blames others."
