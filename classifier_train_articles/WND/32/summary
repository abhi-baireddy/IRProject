A university has announced it will grant credit for learning to play Dungeons and Dragons.
Campus Reform reported the course at Castleton University in Vermont will be "simply on how to play the game rather than the gameâ€™s supposed psychological importance."
Engel told Campus Reform the game is "useful for creating communities and positive social interactions, which are known to improve student success."
He hopes the one-credit course will "help to create a greater sense of community on campus."
The report noted Delaney Whitehead, a sophomore, reasoned that music and art classes also are accredited.
