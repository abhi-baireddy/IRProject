According to Business Insider, experts are saying that marijuana smokers may be more likely to contract coronavirus and have serious COVID-19 symptoms than non-smokers.
â€œFrom China and Italy, we see people who developed COVID-19 and had underlying lung disease, [they] have more complications and die more often," Make said.
They found that 9.2 percent of those patients had chronic lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.
"A lot of lung disease related to these inhalants are silent until they're very far advanced."
Even without a chronic disease, Galiatsatos said, marijuana could put you at a higher risk of ending up with a bad case of COVID-19.
