Police in Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands have retrieved nearly $1 million from a coronavirus mask-supply scammer just as the money was about to be sent to Nigeria.
"In mid-March, as a number of countries were going into lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, German health authorities contracted two sales companies in Zurich and Hamburg to procure EUR 15 million worth of face masks," Interpol said.
The company claimed to have 10 million masks, but the "delivery" fell through.
An agreement for an initial delivery of 1.5 million masks was made, in exchange for an up-front payment of EUR 1.5 million," Interpol said.
"Prompt intervention by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau allowed them to freeze the 1.5 million in the account and identify the Irish company involved," police said.
