Nothing is as soothing to the soul as a deserted beach, where the waves can pound the shore as they have since the dawn of time and not a single jangling cellphone can be heard.

Just ask a crocodile.

The reptiles have been seen soaking up the rays on the lagoon beach at La Ventanilla in Oaxaca, an ecotourism resort on Mexico‚Äôs southern coast, according to a Spanish-language account by Mexican news agency Milenio.com.

Some crocodiles, the news outlet said, were frolicking in the water and appeared to be surfing.

The beaches at Oaxaca have been contested in the past.

In November, one fisherman took a nap on the sand and was attacked by a crocodile, Mexico News Daily reported. The victim was hospitalized but survived.

The Mexican beach is not the only place where wildlife now walks openly in a human-free environment.

Yosemite National Park in California is full of critters that have emerged from hiding.

‚ÄúThe bear population has quadrupled,‚Äù Dane Peterson, who works at the Ahwahnee Hotel in the park, said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt usually here,‚Äù he said, concerning bears, bobcats and coyotes that are now commonly seen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that they usually hang back at the edges, or move in the shadows.‚Äù

The photogenic animals are not always friendly.

Near Missoula, Montana, the Ravalli County Sheriff's Department is warning the public about wildlife sightings, which have increased as human activity has waned, according to KCFW-TV.

In this case, the warning referring to mountain lions prowling about.
