The BBC is being called out by an expert on jihad and Islam for suggesting that King Henry II wrote in a letter that he was considering converting to Islam.
Claudia Gold, writing for BBC History Magazine, noted Henry II was "furious with the archbishop of Canterbury," so he "threatened to forsake Christianity for Islam."
The king had promoted Becket to chancellor much earlier in their relationship, but the two eventually had a falling out.
"Thatâ€™s the entire weak reed on which the BBC bases this entire flight of fancy about Henry II converting to Islam and compelling all of England to do so as well.
"It does not in any way actually mean that Henry was thinking of converting to Islam.
