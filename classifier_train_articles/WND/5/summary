An array of cardboard beds awaits travelers at one Japanese airport who are waiting for the results of COVID-19 screening tests.
At Narita Airport in Tokyo, cardboard beds and quilts have been installed in the baggage claim area, according to Reuters.
The beds used at the airport were made to be used in times when evacuation centers would need to be opened after some type of disaster.
