A former British prison official is warning that male prisoners who "self-identify" as females have been raping women in prisons.
Rory Stewart, a former Tory Cabinet minister, said men should not be given access to women's facilities.
Stewart said that when he was prisons minister in 2018-2019, there were "situations of male prisoners self-identifying as females then raping staff in prison."
DailyMail.com noted it's the "first public reference to trans women assaulting prison staff in women's jails, but it follows warnings that allowing male-bodied criminals into female jails puts women in danger."
In 2018, a inmate self-identifying as "Karen White," after being born Stephen Wood, was allowed into a women's prison, even though he was convicted of multiple rapes.
