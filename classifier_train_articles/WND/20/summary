Speaker Pelosi wanted to pass the $2 trillion package by unanimous consent.
But Massie had the nerve to insist that House members return to Washington and cast a recorded vote.
Massie was excoriated for even suggesting such thing, as it would have slowed down the aid package's passage "by hours."
And second, unanimous consent is supposed to be reserved for routine and minor matters.
Rep. Massie has taken an incredible amount of heat and so far has withstood it.
