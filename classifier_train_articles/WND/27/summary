An officer is on duty at a legally organized protest and gets injured when someone loses his cool and throws an object.
So the policeman can sue the organizer, because he should have known something like that was possible, according to a federal appeals court.
Circuit Court of Appeals has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The ruling, contends a friend-of-the-court brief by the Rutherford Institute, is a threat to the First Amendment's speech rights protections.
Protest speech has been central to American democracy, but the ruling would scare people into not speaking or expressing themselves, the brief argues.
