In the chaotic early days of the COVID crisis, there was one fact we knew for certain about the situation in New York state: The ventilators just weren't there.
Andrew Cuomo would rail at the federal government during his coronavirus media briefings.
The Trump administration isn't getting Cuomo those ventilators!
But have we lost anyone because we didn’t have a bed, or we didn’t have a ventilator, or we didn’t have health care staff?
We can’t," Cuomo said.
