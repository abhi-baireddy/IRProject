Samaritan's Purse CEO Franklin Graham, whose organization has set up an emergency field hospital in New York City's Central Park to battle the coronavirus, urged Gov.
Andrew Cuomo on Thursday "to be careful what we take credit for."
Cuomo told reporters Monday: "God did not stop the spread of the virus.
We continue to see answered prayer in our field hospital," Graham wrote.
In 2014, Cuomo suggested conservatives, including pro-life groups such as Right to Life, leave New York if they don't like his policies.
