The show opened with a video montage of President Trump speaking.
Co-host Mika Brzezinski commented that "President Trump added another step yesterday in his march toward authoritarianism."

Yet, when Trump says his authority is total, Scarborough accuses him of being mentally ill.
If anyone is attempting to gain total authority, it is the tyrannical state governors who are using the virus as an excuse for arbitrary power grabs.
