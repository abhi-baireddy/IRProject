A clip of a TV newscast that appears to show Pope Francis disappearing after retreating from a Vatican City window went viral on social media, prompting conspiracy theories.
Has the Vatican secretly whisked away the pontiff and replaced him with a hologram?
Another video of the April 13 event, from a different angle, shows the pope gradually fading into the darkness.
Afterward, the pope made a brief appearance at a window of the library, overlooking an empty St. Peter's Square.
However, a hologram would probably work seamlessly from directly in front of it, right?"
