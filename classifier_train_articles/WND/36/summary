In San Clemente, California, the answer comes to 37 tons of sand, which the city dumped into Ralph's Skate Court to keep kids away.
“During that [two-week period], we saw people continue to skate the park, groups would gather, kids with their parents; it became a regular [occurrence].
“It just seems there could have been better communication, which could have helped with the response to everybody,” Aguilar told the Times.
“That visual representation of the city dumping sand into the skatepark, it almost feels like, when you look at it, the city vandalized its own park, and I think it pains people to see it," Aguilar said.
