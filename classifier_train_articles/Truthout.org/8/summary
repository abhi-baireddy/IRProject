Well, today we continue my conversation with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author of more than a hundred books.
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, this is typical behavior of autocrats and dictators.
NOAM CHOMSKY: That’s a choice, not an inevitability.
I’m Amy Goodman, as we return to Part 2 of our conversation with Noam Chomsky, world-renowned linguist, political dissident and author.
Noam Chomsky joined us last week from his home in Tucson, Arizona, where he’s sheltering in place with his wife Valeria.
