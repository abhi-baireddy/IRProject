For example, Gulf states like Louisiana are economically dependent on the oil and gas industry for jobs and tax revenues.
However, despite the riches the industry pulls from its wells, the Gulf South remains one of the poorest regions of the country.
Gulf activists are fighting for a world where economies and communities are not dominated by oil, gas and petrochemicals.
Their vision is not just of a different future for the people of the Gulf, but for everyone else as well.
