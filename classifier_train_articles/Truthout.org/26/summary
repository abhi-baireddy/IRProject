Some experts believe that the number of unemployed Americans could go beyond 20 million by the end of this month.
But that target would be difficult to achieve, and Trump himself has sometimes admitted that the economy may not reopen until possibly June.
Besides alleviating the burdens of Americans who now find themselves jobless, the president may have ulterior political motives in reopening the economy.
According to a Morning Consult poll from mid-February, 53 percent of Americans gave Trump positive marks on the economy, while only 39 percent disapproved of how he’s performed in that area.
But while Trump may think this reason enough to get the economy opened back up right away, other data suggests that Americans don’t necessarily see things that way.
