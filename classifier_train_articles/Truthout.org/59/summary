This is not the same as thoughtful and meaningful accessibility measures grounded in disability justice.
Disability justice is a set of principles born out of queer and people-of-color-led disabled brilliance.
I’m focusing on collective access, which is the ninth principle of Berne’s disability justice framework.
Other major benefits beyond disability access, expense savings and keeping people safe from the coronavirus include reducing carbon footprints.
Berne’s theoretical framework, however, can help turn these unprecedented but hurried coronavirus measures into actual disability justice.
