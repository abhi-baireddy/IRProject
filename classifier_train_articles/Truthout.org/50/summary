The unlawful and provocative assassination of Iranâ€™s top general, Qassim Suleimani, has already given rise to an escalating spiral of lethal events.
The greatest risks are to stumble into a devastating war in the Middle East with grave consequences for the peoples of Iran and Iraq and likely across the region.
Such a war would have disastrous effects for this country, for the region and the world.
What is desperately needed with respect to Iran is not any further recourse to coercive diplomacy based on escalating threats, debilitating sanctions, and tit-for-tat military actions.
We call on Congress to act with urgency to stem this slide toward war and regional chaos.
