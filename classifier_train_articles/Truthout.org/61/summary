Trump’s financial dealings with Saudi Arabia have been anything but small change.
In 2001, he sold the entire 45th floor of Trump Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million.
The fact that Trump is the 45th president serves as further proof that the universe has a gruesome sense of humor.
This was not the first time Trump and Saudi Arabia crossed financial paths.
The government of Saudi Arabia is literally living in Trump’s house today, right now, and is paying him for the privilege.
