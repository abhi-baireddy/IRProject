Presidents always take credit for the positive things that happen on their watch, but Donald Trump has gone to a whole new level.
In that sense, coronavirus completely belongs to Trump, although unlike the path of the economy, he really does bear responsibility.
With such a busy schedule, how could we expect Trump to have time to worry about a pandemic?
The CDC was also coping with Trump budget cuts, and is facing another cut of 16 percent slated for next year.
In short, the fact that we are likely facing a serious pandemic, unlike any we have seen in more than a century, is 100 percent Trumpâ€™s fault.
