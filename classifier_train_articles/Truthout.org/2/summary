The president’s plan, unveiled on Thursday, provides a framework for states to follow in order to move from one phase to the next.
Trump’s plan, however, is advisory in nature, putting the onus on states to determine when they should move forward or not.
If a resurgence happens in a state that moved ahead too quickly, for example, the president can shift blame toward that governor.
Without such testing, experts largely agree, no plan to end stay-in-place orders to “reopen the economy” can be feasible.
Many on social media have noted that the approach appears to be a way for Trump to blame others going forward if things go wrong.
