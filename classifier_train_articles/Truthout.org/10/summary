On Friday, Trump sent a triad of tweets in which he called for voters to “liberate” themselves.
“LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020LIBERATE MICHIGAN!

Trump’s calls to “liberate” states from such orders stand in direct contrast to his own recommendations.
