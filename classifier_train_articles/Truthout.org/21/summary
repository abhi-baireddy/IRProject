A Texas judge said on Wednesday that all voters afraid of contracting the coronavirus should be allowed to cast absentee ballots in the coming election.
The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the state’s Democratic Party and voting rights groups seeking an order requiring the state to allow all voters to cast mail ballots.
“Voters should not have to choose between their lives or their right to vote.”But Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, vowed to appeal the ruling, arguing that mail voting could lead to fraud.
Five states already plan to run all-mail elections this year, and 28 other states allow voters to request a mail ballot for any reason.
“Twenty-three percent of ballots were cast by mail in 2016, and twenty-six percent of ballots were cast by mail in 2018.”Paxton went even further earlier this week, threatening to bring felony charges against voting rights groups that promote mail voting.
