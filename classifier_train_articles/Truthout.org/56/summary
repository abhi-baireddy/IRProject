The structure of disability benefits programs, along with unfair labor practices, are confining people with disabilities to dire economic destitution.
To address the U.S. poverty crisis, especially among people with disabilities, working-class people must fight for a new universal benefits guarantee.
When a new universal benefits system is achieved and a model that accounts for people with disabilities as people, working-class solidarity is built.
A universal benefits program will maintain disability rights as human rights by including all working-class people into a universal program.
By achieving a universal benefits model, attacks to the benefits system will be easier to stop, and all people will be invested into a system that delivers economic justice and inclusion.
