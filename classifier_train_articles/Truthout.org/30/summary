The charitableness that billionaires like Cooperman enjoy touting ends abruptly when the idea of a wealth tax is introduced.
Perhaps what has these billionaires scared the most is the massively popularity of a wealth tax.
A New York Times/SurveyMonkey poll from July showed that 66 percent of adults support a 2 percent wealth tax, as do 58 percent of Republicans age 35-54.
Steyer has also said, “If you want to represent the Democratic Party, you’ve got to be dealing with … incredible income and wealth disparities,” and called on Bloomberg to support a wealth tax.
Perhaps the billionaire critics of the wealth tax will soon learn that their side is a losing one.
