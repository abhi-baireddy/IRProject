AMY GOODMAN: Before we go to break, on Wednesday, just before Bernie Sanders announced, but it did look like he was about to pull out of the presidential race, I asked political dissident, linguist and author Noam Chomsky about his assessment of the Bernie Sanders campaign in this time of the coronavirus pandemic.
NOAM CHOMSKY: If Trump is reelected, it’s a indescribable disaster.
It means that the policies of the past four years, which have been extremely destructive to the American population, to the world, will be continued and probably accelerated.
It’s common to say now that the Sanders campaign failed.
I think it was an extraordinary success, completely shifted the arena of debate and discussion.
