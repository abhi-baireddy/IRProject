Certainly, marginal federal income tax rates appear to be progressive as they increase from 10 percent to 37 percent as one’s income increases.
One, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, when we look at all federal, state and local income taxes paid, the system is much less progressive than if we just look at federal income taxes alone.
The rich may argue that the wealth tax is a form of double taxation, as they have already paid income taxes on the wealth they have accumulated.
But I doubt the wealthy would prefer a flat 9 percent wealth tax over a “discriminatory” 3 percent wealth tax that hits only them.
The wealthy will not like that the 3 percent wealth tax may eat into their real wealth over time.
