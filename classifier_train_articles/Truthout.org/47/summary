Jones is parroting the exact prediction that a different billionaire hedge fund manager, Leon Cooperman, made two weeks ago.
All the wealth tax tantrums among these billionaire traders belie the simple fact that they already charge a wealth tax, of sorts, themselves.
Hedge fund managers charge their clients an upfront fee of 2 percent of their entire investment, just to get in the door.
Hedge fund managers then also take 20 percent of any profits they make for their clients each year.
If it sounds like these billionaires would be paying a whole lot of money if a wealth tax were implemented — that’s true!
