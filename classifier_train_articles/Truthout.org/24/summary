The Democratic presidential campaign has taken a strange twist in recent days, with candidates being asked whether we should have billionaires.
While there may be some grand philosophical questions at stake here, I will stick to more mundane economic ones.
If we buy the right-wing story, the superrich got their money from their great contribution to society.
People really like iPhones, so in that sense, Jobs did contribute to making society better off.
We can go down the list and find major policy failings that allowed many, if not most, of these billionaires to make their billions.
