Employees of public health departments are the “front line” public health workers who are “trained to mobilize” and fight epidemics, Himmelstein said.
Unlike the health care system in other developed countries, the U.S. system is shaped by the profit-seeking private insurance companies and health care providers.
This creates massive holes in the public health response to outbreaks of disease and leaves some communities more vulnerable than others.
Not only would this aid the public health response to coronavirus that has been weakened by years of austerity, it would better prepare the health care system for future outbreaks.
“We need significantly more action to protect not only public workers but the public overall and the economy,” said Thornton.
