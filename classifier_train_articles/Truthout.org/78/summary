Older applicants who are denied Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits struggle in the labor market afterward, new research confirms, providing further evidence that SSDI’s standards are stringent.
Although most of the denied applicants worked five years before applying, very few worked five years after, Schimmel Hyde and Wu found.
The new study adds to a body of research that has found dim labor-market and economic outcomes for denied SSDI applicants.
More recently, studies published in 2011 and 2015, which we summarized here, found large drops in work and earnings among rejected SSDI applicants.
In short, many denied applicants suffer great economic harm from their disability but nevertheless don’t qualify for benefits.
