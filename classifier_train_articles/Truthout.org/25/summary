Chomsky, Pollin and Polychroniou are co-authors of a book on climate change and the Green New Deal, forthcoming with Verso in Spring 2020.
Polychroniou: Noam, let me start with you and ask you to share your thoughts about the uniqueness of the climate change crisis.
Robert Pollin: The Green New Deal has gained tremendous traction as an organizing framework over the past year.
Pollin: In fact, clean energy investments will be a major source of new job creation, in all regions of the globe.
Noam, how do we increase public awareness about the need for government action vis-Ã -vis climate change?
