Trump has been hijacking the daily coronavirus briefings to strut, preen, lie, attack and generally indulge himself in being the gibberish fountain he is at his infamous nonsense rallies.
“What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?” Trump replied, “A lot.
A lot.” Reid pressed, “The video has a gap.” Trump snarled back, “You know, you’re a fake.”So it was like that, until it got worse.
“When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that is the way it’s gonna be,” said Trump to the gobsmacked assemblage.
Such a move flies in the face of all medical and scientific advice, including that which has been coming from the daily coronavirus briefings in between Trump’s bouts of verbal diarrhea.
