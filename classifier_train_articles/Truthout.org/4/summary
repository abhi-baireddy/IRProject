Conventional economic wisdom says a time of crisis is not the moment to enact tax increases.
At the top of the list of new tax increases should be a wealth tax on our billionaire class.
A new Institute for Policy Studies Inequality briefing paper, authored by Bob Lord, reveals that between 1980 and 2018, the taxes paid by America’s billionaires, when measured as a percentage of their wealth, decreased a staggering 79 percent.
As we emerge from this pandemic with trillions of additional debt on the nation’s balance sheet, substantial tax increases are inevitable.
That, the IPS report concluded, requires a wealth tax:Only an annual wealth tax — a direct tax on billionaire wealth — can reliably limit the Billionaire Class rate of wealth accumulation to a level no greater than wealth accumulation for the population at large.
