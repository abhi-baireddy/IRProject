There were negotiations about dealing with the Iranian nuclear programs.
As Iran was rapidly increasing its capacities, more centrifuges and so on, Obama finally agreed to the joint agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, in 2015.
Now there is a new pretext: It’s not nuclear weapons; it’s that Iran is meddling in the region.
Of course, Iran, like every other power, is trying to extend its influence.
That would essentially eliminate any concern over not only nuclear weapons, but weapons of mass destruction.
