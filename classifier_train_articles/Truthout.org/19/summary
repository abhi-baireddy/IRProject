Warming feedbacks creating especially worrisome heat waves and droughts are more likely today on a warmer Earth than they have been in the past.
It’s these extremes that matter most: Averages don’t kill that often, but extremes do.
The bottom line is that climate extremes are far from well-understood, and it’s these extremes that are the most important.
Because hurricane intensity, formation and landfall remain difficult to predict, some of us will be spared extra heat because of COVID-19 … maybe.
