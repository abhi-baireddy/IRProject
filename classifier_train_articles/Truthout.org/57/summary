Activists say people have died from the pollution here and have given Cancer Alley the new moniker, Death Alley.
The Green New Deal contains specific language for such environmental justice communities, where lower-income people of color are overburdened by pollution.
It was activists fighting for environmental justice that paved the way for “the Green New Deal moment,” according to the Alliance’s website.
Still, the promise of a Green New Deal is inspiring organizers in Death Alley and across the Gulf South.
Perhaps a Green New Deal could bring green infrastructure to Death Alley and the jobs that come with it.
