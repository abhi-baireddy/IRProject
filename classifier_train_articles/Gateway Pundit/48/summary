The common flu does more damage than the coronavirus but the world seems to be reluctant to focus on anything else.
According to overnight updates, the number of coronavirus cases in the US now stands at 9,464 cases.
The percent of deaths from the coronavirus to deaths from the flu is 0.7% (155/22,000).
In the past few days the number of deaths in the US from the coronavirus passed the number flu deaths in Hong Kong (7-8 million people) which were 113.
The Centre reminds the public that although the winter flu peak period has ended, citizens should continue to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent respiratory diseases.
