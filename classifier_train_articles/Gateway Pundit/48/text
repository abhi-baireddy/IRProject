In the past few days the number of deaths in the US from the coronavirus passed the number flu deaths in Hong Kong (7-8 million people) which were 113.

As we reported previously, since the beginning of the year the flu in Hong Kong has been much more consequential than the coronavirus:

The Centre for Health Protection announced today that the winter flu season has ended. During this period, 113 adults died of influenza and no deaths from children were recorded. The Centre reminds the public that although the winter flu peak period has ended, citizens should continue to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent respiratory diseases.

There have been 4 deaths from the coronavirus to date in 2020 in Hong Kong.

The US is now willing to spend $1 trillion on the coronavirus. It would be nice to see this go to other ailments where it might be better used.
