Not so, says a bombshell new report by scientists from the University of Cambridge in Britain.
“What we reconstruct in the network is the first significant spread among humans,” Mr Forster said.
Despite rumors that the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, Forster said: “If I am pressed for an answer, I would say the original spread started more likely in southern China than in Wuhan.
In the Hubei province, where Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million residents, is, China said there were just 1,290 deaths.
But on Friday, Beijing raised Wuhan’s coronavirus death toll by nearly 50 percent after weeks of charges that communist party officials were underreporting the numbers.
