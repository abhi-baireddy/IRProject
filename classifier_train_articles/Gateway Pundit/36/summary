We first reported in late July that Texas businessman Ed Butowsky filed a lawsuit where he outed reporter Ellen Ratner as his source for information on Seth Rich.
According to the lawsuit Seth Rich provided WikiLeaks the DNC emails before the 2016 election, not Russia.
Butowsky claims in his lawsuit:Ms. Rattner said Mr. Assange told her that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron, were responsible for releasing the DNC emails to Wikileaks.
The corrupt FBI and Mueller team claim the emails were hacked but neither entity inspected the DNC server which was supposedly hacked.
The “DNC Emails were hacked” story becomes more and more suspect every day.
