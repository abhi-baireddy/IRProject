Texans gathered at the State Capitol in Austin on Saturday to participate in a rally dubbed, “You Can’t Close America” in protest of the Coronavirus lockdown.
Protesters were chanting, “fire Fauci!” and “let us work!”Dr. Anthony Fauci led the country into a lockdown by touting inaccurate IHME Coronavirus doomsday models.
The IHME doomsday models predicted 200,000 Americans would die if strict lockdown and social distancing measures were put in place.
Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx ignored all of the other Coronavirus models that projected 20,000-40,000 deaths and caused mass hysteria across the country.
