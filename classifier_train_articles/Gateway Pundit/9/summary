Racine Sheriff Christopher Schmaling, screen imageRacine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling announced on Friday his department will not be enforcing Wisconsin’s Draconian stay-at-home order.
Sheriff Schmaling urged the Wisconsin DHS to develop a workable plan that balances safety and gives business owners a way to still operate their businesses.
Four sheriffs in Michigan are also defying the Governor’s authoritarian stay-at-home order.
“Each of us took an oath to uphold and defend the Michigan Constitution, as well as the US Constitution, and to ensure that your God given rights are not violated.
We believe that we are the last line of defense in protecting your civil liberties,” the Michigan sheriffs said.
