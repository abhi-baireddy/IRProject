Democrat lawmaker Karen Whitsett credits hydroxychloroquine and President Trump for saving her life from the coronavirus.
Whitsett credited President Trump for speaking out in support of the drug.
Hydroxychloroquine was quickly banned by Democrat Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer for use against COVID-19 after President Trump tweeted out his support for the drug.
Whitmer threatened doctors to ignore prescription requests for hydroxychloroquine and pharma-grade zinc.
New York City physician Dr. Vladimir Zelenko said he has used a combination of hydroxychloroquine and pharma-grade zinc to treat hundreds of patients with coronavirus.
