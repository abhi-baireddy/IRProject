Former First Lady Michelle Obama has been given a show by PBS starting next week, the taxpayer funded network announced Friday.
The timing of the announcement comes after Democrats marked $75 million for PBS’s parent the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the coronavirus relief bill that passed at the end of March.
Newsbusters reported the $75 million is on top of the $465 million given CPB in the current year’s federal budget, which is an increase of $20 million over the previous year.
Local PBS and NPR stations receive funding from CBP as well as donations from the public, businesses and charitable foundations.
