New York City now has its own snitch line!

Earlier this week socialist New York City Mayor Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters New York City will not reopen until July or August AT THE EARLIEST!

This is straight out of the Marxist handbook.

How do you report places that aren’t enforcing social distancing? It’s simple: just snap a photo and text it to 311-692. #AskMyMayor pic.twitter.com/WQdCcVf1Rl — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) April 18, 2020
