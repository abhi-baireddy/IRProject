New Jersey Police arrested Kim Pagan on Friday for organizing a non-approved protest of the state government.
Kim organized the rally to protest the governor’s stay-at-home orders.
The state police Kim violated the emergency orders “by organizing a prohibited event” — a protest against the governor!
Governor Phil Murphy swore to protect these individual rights in January 2018.
