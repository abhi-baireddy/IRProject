China media now claims that the coronavirus was started by American athletes who visited Wuhan in October 2019.
China propaganda also claims that the coronavirus started in Wuhan after an athletic event in October when Americans brought the virus to China.
Despite having the largest military in the world, tenfold, the US came in 35th behind nations like Iran, Finland and Slovenia.
The US team went home on October 28, 2019, and within 2 weeks, the first human contact cases of COVID 19 were seen in Wuhan.
Across China, many of its citizens believe that the coronavirus originated from an American athlete at the Wuhan games.
