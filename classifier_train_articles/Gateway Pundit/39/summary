Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) is the only one of 53 Republican senators who was not invited to be on President Trumpâ€™s Congressional coronavirus group on reopening the U.S. economy.
Romney was the only Republican senator who voted to convict and remove Trump from office in his impeachment trial earlier this year.
Nearly two dozen House and Senate Democrats were named to the group, all of whom voted to impeach or convict Trump.
Additionally, the Opening Up America Again Congressional Group discussed the rapidly expanding access to COVID-19 diagnostic and anti-body tests, ventilators, face masks, and other PPE.
President Trump was pleased to hear such positive feedback from the Members about the work that the Administration is doing to keep America healthy and prosperous, and thanked them for their participation.
