New York Governor Andrew Cuomo attacked President Trump in his daily briefing Friday over Trump’s plan announced Thursday for the phased reopening of the economy from the shutdowns due to the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus.
Cuomo complained New York was getting shortchanged by the Trump administration and accused Trump of ‘passing the buck’ to the states without adequate funding.
Trump’s plan calls for each state to be responsible for their own plan to meet the voluntary guidelines.
Trump has consistently said the federal government is there to back up the states, not do everything for them.
