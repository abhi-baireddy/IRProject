Attorney Ty Clevenger has tried for the past three years to obtain documents related to Seth Rich from the Deep State but has received nothing.
Now another document has been released that refers to Seth Rich but this was never provided to Clevenger.
Per our report Clevenger filed his request again asking for all information related to the Seth Rich case.
She said that she believes Russia made up the Seth Rich story and agreed with the Mueller report on what was said about Seth Rich (p. 96).
There is likely no reason for the redactions in the emails to Judicial Watch as well as the delays in producing Seth Rich related emails.
