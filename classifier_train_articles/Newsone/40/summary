Straight from our WTH files, a Detroit dollar store on Tuesday was forced to remove a figurines depicting a White cherub with armor and a sword crushing the head of a Black horned angel.
The manager explained that they meant to remove the figurines last week, but, well, got too busy with the holidays.
Everybody knows that Black folks are some of the biggest dollar store consumers, and they would have remembered if shoppers had decided to take their dollars elsewhere.
But he and his supporters have to accept that the browning of America is here to stay no matter how many racist figurines crop up at dollar stores.
