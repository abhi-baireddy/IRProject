I imagine Atatiana’s nephew felt at home with his aunt.
Atatiana’s nephew had to break the news to his mother that her sister had been gunned down in cold blood.
How do we tell Black kids about Aiyana Jones?
But those fears have been validated by every story of police tearing families away from Black kids and Black kids away from their families.
I find myself mourning Atatiana and crying for her nephew.
