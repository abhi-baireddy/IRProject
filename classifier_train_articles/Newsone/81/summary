ET, March 15 —Joe Biden during the Democratic debate Sunday night vowed that his “running mate will be a woman,” repeating a pledge he made at the last debate and igniting rumors about who he might have in mind.
With the presumption that Biden, if he is the Democratic nominee, would select a Black woman, the leading choices were Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris.
Abrams’s name was followed by Harris and Nina Turner, another Black woman and former Ohio senator who is one of Sanders’ top surrogates.
Biden’s wins have solidified the thought process that Black voters prefer him to other candidates because of his loyalty to Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president.
