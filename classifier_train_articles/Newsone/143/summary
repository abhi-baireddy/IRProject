Former Vice President @JoeBiden calls out @MikeBloomberg for his controversial "stop and frisk" policy: "The policy was abhorrent, and it was a violation of every right people have."
However, the aforementioned Black politicians are on a list of nearly two dozen other Black leaders who have publicly avowed their support for the former New York City mayor.
Bloomberg has apologized for his checkered racist past, which some Black folks – well a lot of Black folks – have deemed disingenuous.
It was a racist policy that went racist.
While it cannot be asserted that Bloomberg’s endorsements from Black politicians and leaders are monetarily motivated, it is certainly a topic of conversation as the number of his Black endorsers increases.
