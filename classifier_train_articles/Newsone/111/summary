“She’s qualified to be president, and I’d consider her for anything that she would be interested in,” Biden told the Bee’s California Nation podcast.
Biden’s name-dropping of Harris was timely because she has increasingly been discussed in the context of a vice presidential running mate for the eventual nominee since she suspended her campaign last month.
Staff writers at New York’s Intelligencer cited Harris’ low polling as a reason why she may not be the best choice as a running mate.
The Atlantic wondered if the splintered state of Harris’ campaign — the “leaking, backbiting, and blame-slinging by her staff” — damaged her chances at being picked to run for vice president.
As a Black woman, Abrams could also bring some of the same qualities as Harris to the top of a Democratic presidential ticket.
