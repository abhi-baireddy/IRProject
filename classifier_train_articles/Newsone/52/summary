Immediately, my liberal timeline was flooded with “Not my President!” and progressives refusing to say his name.
President Trump is, so far, one of the worst and most dishonest presidents we’ve seen in modern history, which is why we need to say his name.
Trying to erase President Trump only emboldens him and inflames a cultural war where there are no victors.
Just like you have to name a disease for research and eventually destroy the strain, President Donald Trump must be named.
Say his damn name, even if the syllables choke you.
