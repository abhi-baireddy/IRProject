Ben Carson is the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and one of his missions has been to prevent low-income people from getting fair housing.
The former neurosurgeon announced in August that he was delaying an Obama-era rule that allowed low-income people to afford housing in areas with better schools.

The rule goes into effect in 23 metropolitan areas and should not cost the administration any more money.”Why would Carson attempt to prevent low-income people from getting better education and access to job opportunities?
Hopefully, this Obama-era rule, which will help poor whites as well, will help all Americans gain access to affordable and safe housing.
