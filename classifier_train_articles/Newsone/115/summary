The NFL officially banned kneeling Wednesday (May 23) among players who are protesting racism during the National Anthem.
League officials also issued an ultimatum: players, team and league personnel can either stand for the anthem or stay in the locker room.
Statement from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pic.twitter.com/1Vn7orTo1R — NFL (@NFL) May 23, 2018Before the NFL decided on the kneeling crackdown and supported White privilege over Black lives again, its players had united together for a worthy cause.
Keeping it all the way real, the league can’t control everything about its players.
While the NFL may be able to exert some control over players’ physical movements during the anthem and kneel to Trump, it can’t stop players from being vocal about racism off the field and behind closed doors.
