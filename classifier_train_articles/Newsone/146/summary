When it comes to Black voters, Biden still remains in the lead but Warren has surged tremendously.
In July, Warren only had 4 percent of the Black vote, while in August she had 8 percent.
Now, in September she has 19% of the Black vote, which is nearly half of Biden’s 40 percent Black vote support.
Biden is still beating Warren with the 65+ age group with 41 percent support compared to 28 percent for Warren.
Unfortunately, the poll doesn’t break down the demographics of Black voters, although reports indicate that older Black voters favor Biden while younger Black voters are spending time trying to convince their elders to give up Biden.
