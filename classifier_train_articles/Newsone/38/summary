The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is known for creating innovative videos to inform applicants about when admissions decisions will be revealed.
This year’s video featured Marvel Comics character Riri Williams—a African-American teenage superhero, reports Digital Trends.
In the video, MIT student Ayomide F. takes on the role of Williams, who was introduced in the May 2016 issue of Invincible Iron Man.
In Marvel Comics lore, she eventually filled in for Tony when he became sick and took the name Ironheart as her superhero nickname.
