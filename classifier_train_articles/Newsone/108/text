On April 29, Jennifer Schulte made internet history when she decided to call the police on Black people at a barbecue. She will now and forever be known as BBQ Becky, a nickname which led to some of the best memes of 2018.

In case you missed it, BBQ Becky called 911 because Black people were barbecuing with charcoal in Oakland, California at Lake Merritt. However, the police did not come — she claims she waited two hours. In the 911 call, the dispatcher says, “Are you living in the park or something? Why can’t you separate yourself?”

Schulte also refused to give out her race, although she willingly disclosed the race of the people she called the cops on, saying repeatedly, “My race doesn’t matter!” The dispatcher says her race matters and asks if she has ever been to a mental facility.

BBQ Becky said she was being followed, but you can repeatedly hear Michelle Snider, the woman who filmed the video, demanding BBQ Becky return her husband’s business card, which she denied having on the call (though she clearly had in the card in the video). See the video below:
