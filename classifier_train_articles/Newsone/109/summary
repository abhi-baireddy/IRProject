UPDATED: 10 a.m. EDT, Oct. 13 —In the past six months, America has witnessed — or turned a blind eye to — multiple public executions of unarmed Black people as the troubling trend shows no signs of ending.
Atatiana Jefferson was just 28 years old and guilty of only being in her own home when a Fort Worth police officer shot and killed her early this morning.
Rewind just six days earlier and a white woman in Georgia who witnessed a driver commit a hit and run decided to chase the culprit, block him with her own car and shoot him to death.
Video footage showed Rosefeld shooting as Rose fled, showing the officer was not facing any imminent threat of danger when he discharged his service weapon.
