NFL player LeSean McCoy was accused of beating up his girlfriend as explicit photos showing a woman with a bloody, swollen and bruised face made the rounds on social media late Tuesday morning.
McCoy quickly responded by posting on his own Instagram, categorically denying any of the accusations.
The Bills were investigating the claims, according to a tweet from an ESPN reporter covering the NFL.
Whether the claims were true or not, the NFL has long had a domestic violence problem with its players.
However, two of the groupâ€™s leading members resigned last month because they said it was ineffective, according to ABC News.
