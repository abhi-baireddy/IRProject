TMZ has continually faced scrutiny for taking things too far when reporting Black death, including posting graphic photos before the news of the deceased has even had time to settle with family members.
By Monday morning, it was revealed that former Minnesota Vikings and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Tarvaris Jackson died in a car crash at 36 years old and already, TMZ published graphic photos of the crash.
Not too long ago, TMZ received backlash for their coverage of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna‘s death in a helicopter crash.
Although Nipsey Hussle‘s death wasn’t mentioned in the petition, TMZ also released surveillance footage of the rapper’s murder in 2019, showing him being shot several times and also kicked by his killer.
In 2018, TMZ reported the death of Florida rapper XXXTentacion and included video footage of the rapper in his car after being shot.
