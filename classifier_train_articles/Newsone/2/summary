The list to get into the National Museum of African American History and Culture is epically long.
I scanned the room and like bright-red ants, young men were scurrying around the museum wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.
I said to a friend who was with me, “That could be Trump’s slogan for 2020.”“Make America Great Again” is a coded version of “whites only” and “no coloreds allowed” signs.
There were no “Make America Great Again” hats when I was a teenager.
Furthermore, as I studied the rusted chains that were used on enslaved West African children or heartbreakingly stared at Emmett Till’s mangled face, the “Make America Great Again” hats in the National Museum of African American History were poetic irony.
