Ayanna Pressley is the first Black women to represent Congress in Massachusetts and she has been fighting for serious change.
Her latest bill is to end discriminatory school discipline policies specifically targeting Black girls.
Educators-in-training also viewed the behaviors of students of color as being more hostile than similar actions performed by white kids.
The alarming study highlighted how students of color often get shepherded into the school-to-prison pipeline, which is exactly what Pressley is fighting against.
The bill is also co-sponsored by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
