If there was one thing that people can say for sure about Joe Biden‘s presidential candidacy, it’s that his political ad game has been on point the entire time he’s been running, bar none.
It was the latter approach that was reserved for his most recent ad about President Donald Trump‘s delayed and lackadaisical response to the coronavirus outbreak.
