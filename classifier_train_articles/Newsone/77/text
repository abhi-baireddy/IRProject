UPDATED: 8:23 a.m. ET, March 9 —

The endorsements from a veritable who’s who of Black elected officials keep rolling in for Joe Biden as the political wave across the country seems to be trying to elbow Bernie Sanders out of contention for the Democratic nomination.

That seemed to be true on Monday morning when Cory Booker also formally lent his support to and co-signed Team Biden for president, joining a growing list of his fellow Congressional Black Caucus members. The senator from New Jersey sang a familiar tune of an urgent need to heal the nation that we’ve also heard from the past few also-rans who have, like Booker, dropped out and ultimately deferred to Biden’s strong candidacy.

Months ago, Booker was publicly questioning everything from Biden’s cognitive abilities to his stance on the topic of race. On Monday, Booker guaranteed Biden will become the Democratic nominee and beat Trump in November.

show there's more that unites us than divides us. He’ll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Joe. pic.twitter.com/RcsnZs5mfQ — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 9, 2020

One day earlier, Kamala Harris also announced her endorsement of Biden in no uncertain terms.

“There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office,” she wrote in a statement posted on Medium in addition to a separate video posted to social media.

Both Booker and Harris have been rumored to be among possible vice presidential candidates Biden was considering.

The number of Black elected officials who have rallied around Biden has been a lopsided contest compared to Sanders, who in recent weeks has lost polling ground to the former vice president. But Sanders is also building momentum with Black voters and just on Sunday gained the not insignificant endorsement of civil rights icon Rev. Jesse Jackson in resounding fashion.

“With the exception of Native Americans, African Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,” Jackson said in a statement Biden’s campaign released Sunday morning. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path. The most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Senator Bernie Sanders represents the most progressive path. That’s why I choose to endorse him today.”

Jackson was never an elected official like the list of Black politicians below, but his word carries weight and could make a lot of Black folks think twice about who they’ll actually vote for in the coming primaries and in the general election.

Original story:

Presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden has received another Congressional Black Caucus endorsement following the chaotic South Carolina debate on Tuesday night. U.S. Rep. James “Jim” Clyburn of South Carolina, who is the highest-ranking Black member of Congress, has revealed his support for Biden in the 2020 Democratic Presidential run.

“I’ve been saying to the media, I’ve known for a long time who I’m going to vote for. But I had not decided — well, not to share it with the public,” Clyburn said during a news conference in North Charleston. “But I want the public to know that I’m voting for Joe Biden. South Carolina should be voting for Joe Biden.”

The House Majority Whip continued, “I can think of no one better suited, better prepared, I can think of no one with the integrity, no one more committed to the fundamental principles that make this country what it is than my good friend.”

Clyburn’s endorsement further places Biden ahead of his opponents, earning over a dozen other Congressional Black Caucus endorsements.

Prior to Clyburn, Biden received four additional endorsements from Democratic Reps. Frederica Wilson (Fla.), Alcee Hastings (Fla.), Sanford Bishop (Ga.) and Donald Payne Jr. (N.J.), thus making him the only 2020 candidate to receive more than one endorsement from the CDC.

Well, until former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg crept up from behind, nabbing four CDC endorsements of his own.

Earlier this month, it was announced that Bloomberg has received endorsements from three members of the Congressional Black Caucus – Democratic U.S. Representative Gregory Meeks of New York City, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands and U.S. Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia – whose son Jordan Davis was murdered by a white man for playing music loudly in his car.

Democratic U.S. Representative Bobby Rush of Illinois announced his endorsement for Bloomberg in January. However, the aforementioned Black politicians are on a list of nearly two dozen other Black leaders who have publicly avowed their support for the former New York City mayor.

Sen. Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the race in December, was the only Democratic presidential candidate giving Biden a run for his money as it pertained to appealing to the CDC.

Sen. Cory Booker, who ended his run in December, trailed behind both Biden and Harris.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has received one CDC endorsement from Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, which was announced in November. While describing Warren as a “bold, compassionate leader” who would “put power back in the hands of people” according to Politico, Pressley said, “I am so grateful to call Elizabeth Warren a friend, a partner in good, and my Senator. I am proud to endorse her candidacy for President.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders was endorsed by Ilhan Omar in October, while Maryland Congressman Anthony Brown announced his endorsement for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg last month.

Neither Tom Steyer nor Sen. Amy Klobuchar garnered endorsements from any members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
