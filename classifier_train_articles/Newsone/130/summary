The first batch of stimulus payments has reportedly been or was in the process of being directly deposited electronically into some taxpayers’ bank accounts this week.
But it’s a different story for the actual physical paper checks, which were expected to take longer to be delivered.
Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. Treasury to print the checks with the president’s name on it instead of using the standard Treasury checks, the Washington Post reported Tuesday night.
That’s right: The delivery of the stimulus checks could be delayed because Trump wanted recipients to see his name in the upper left-hand corner of the check (even though they’re more concerned about the numerical figure on the right-hand side).
People will receive paper checks if they indicated in past tax filings that to be their preferred method of payment.
