Actress Taraji P. Henson has evolved into a fierce advocate for mental health awareness.
The campaign was created to raise funds that will cover expenses related to mental health services for individuals who have been significantly impacted by the public health crisis.
The foundation will align individuals with culturally competent therapists and cover the costs for up to five virtual therapy sessions.
This campaign is for underserved communities experiencing life-changing events related to or triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
BLHF Executive Director Tracie Jade Jenkins believes the COVID-19 Free Virtual Therapy Campaign will be instrumental in removing the stigma around seeking help for mental illness.
