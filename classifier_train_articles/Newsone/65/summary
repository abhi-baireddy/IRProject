Several NFL players have reportedly started thinking about new ways to protest police brutality as well as the football league itself since a new, controversial national anthem policy was announced last week.
Twenty-five percent of the league’s players were being recruited to sit out, columnist Shaun King tweeted Sunday.
But I won’t be watching this NFL season because of the unfair cowardly and idiotic kneeling ban.
Players deciding to stay on the field during the season can still choose to protest brutality in creative ways that don’t violate the league’s anthem policy.
It’s clear that NFL players won’t stop fighting brutality, being outspoken about it off the field and outside the league.
