Rapper YNW Melly is reportedly begging for his life while incarcerated and fighting the coronavirus.
Cops say Melly, along with his friend Cortlen Henry, shot and killed the two victims in the head, torso and back in October 2018.
Melly released his debut album “Melly vs. Melvin” while he was behind bars in 2019.
The report came hours before New York City rapper Fred Da Godson tweeted that he had been hospitalized with the coronavirus.
