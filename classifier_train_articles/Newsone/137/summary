Every now and then, former President Barack Obama has to hop on Twitter and call out Donald Trump’s administration for their grave shenanigans.
This week, Trump rolled back one of the strongest attempts by Obama’s administration to combat climate change.
Critics say Trump’s roll-backs will lead to more life-threatening air pollution and force Americans to spend more on gas.
Obama tweeted about the detrimental move, referencing Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
“We can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial.”When reports of people contracting the coronavirus surfaced, Trump initially downplayed the gravity of the situation.
