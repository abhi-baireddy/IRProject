On February 21, 1965, former Nation of Islam leader and influential Black Civil Rights activist Malcolm X was assassinated in New York City.
Born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, X, who later changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, would go on to be one of the most pivotal, influential leaders in the struggle for Black human rights in the United States and abroad.
And his words, his fiery, prophetic words, still hold true today:“I wouldn’t suggest that they vote for any party or either party.
I would suggest that the so-called Negroes become politically mature, realize the power that they hold in the field of politics.
Whatever is necessary.”SEE ALSO:Still Under Her Spell: 5 of Nina Simone’s Most Uplifting And Insightful QuotesToday In Black History: Malcolm X Assassination was originally published on hellobeautiful.com
