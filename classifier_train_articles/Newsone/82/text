Maxine Waters, or Auntie Maxine as we lovingly call her, has been been a fearless leader of justice for years. The 80 year old has more spirit than Democrats half her age. As we all know, Waters is enemy number one for Trump, but that hasn’t stopped her activism or fighting spirit. Now, she has made history as the first woman and African American to be the chair of the House Financial Services Committee.

After being sworn in yesterday, Waters told MSNBC, “I’ve been focused on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That was the center piece of the Dodd/Frank reform. And Mulvaney who was sent over temporarily by the president to oversee it after the guy who headed it left to run for governor. And he’s tried to dismantle the Consumer Financial

Protection Bureau.”

She continued, “I’m going to focus on that and we’re going to try and undo the damage that Mulvaney has done. The last two years have been very dangerous. I have been appalled and surprised at how blatant it has been. This administration is not at all concerned about the welfare of the average family.”

Well said.
