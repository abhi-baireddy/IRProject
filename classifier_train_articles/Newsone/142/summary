A Black Democratic state representative from Georgia was feeling the repercussions of breaking Party ranks after offering his full-throated endorsement of Donald Trump‘s candidacy for re-election.
Georgia State Rep. Vernon Jones, who has a checkered past when it comes to showing loyalty to Democrats announced on Tuesday that Trump was his man in 2020, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) reported.
Jones’ endorsement of Trump got him publicly chewed out by Nikema Williams, the Chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia.
“Vernon Jones is an embarrassment to the Democratic Party and does not stand for our values, Williams said in part.
Jones’ endorsement of Trump came on the same day that former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden for president on the Democratic ticket.
