Harvey Weinstein is expected to go to prison for a long time after his sexual assault convictions.
According to CNN, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison, which should silence the many Bill Cosby apologists who claim Weinstein isn’t chastised as much as Black male celebrities accused of sexual assault.
Judge James Burke sentences Weinstein to 20 years in prison for first-degree criminal sexual act and three years in prison for third-degree rape.
“If Harvey Weinstein had not been convicted by this jury, it would have happened again and again and again,” Haley said to the court.
Since the news of Weinstein’s sentencing has hit social media, folks couldn’t help but drag Bill Cosby apologists, like Snoop Dogg, who constantly redirected sexual assault condemnation from Cosby to Weinstein, arguing that white men never get reprimanded.
