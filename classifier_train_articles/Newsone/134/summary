NBA star LeBron James has continually used his I Promise School as a vessel to support those in need.
How LeBron James’ I Promise School is helping students during coronavirus pandemic https://t.co/XlsSPFd4Fs — MSN Sports (@MSNSports) March 15, 2020Although all private and public schools in Ohio will remain shuttered for at least three weeks, the LeBron James Family Foundation has decided to keep the Akron-based school’s Family Resource Center open.
At the center students and their families will be given care packages with items provided by the Akron Food Bank and Smuckers, clothing, shelter and medical help if needed.
The decision to keep the Family Resource Center operating will be instrumental in alleviating some of the socio-economic barriers that have been heightened due to the health crisis.
In 2019, James announced he will be adding transitional housing for the families of students that are facing financial hardships.
