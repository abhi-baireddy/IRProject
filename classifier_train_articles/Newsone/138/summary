California has just signed a historic bill that could finally lead to more college athletes getting paid.
Gavin Newsom signed a bill that will let California athletes be compensated for use of their names, images, and likeness.
Bill 206 was introduced by Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) and it steadily gained national attention from athletes like James and Draymond Green.
“This is truly a historic moment for college athletes,” Skinner said.
