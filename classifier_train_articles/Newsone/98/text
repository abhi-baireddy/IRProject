As you may already know @serenawilliams and @alexisohanian married yesterday in New Orleans. @voguemagazine has released photos from the wedding and reception. I have attached the link to the photos on my profile page. I picked 10 for here as that is all I can add but it was hard. Her dress is Sarah Burton for @alexandermcqueen . Alexis is wearing Giorgi Armani. Wishing Serena and Alexis along with beautiful @olympiaohanian a lifetime of love and happiness. ❤️😍😘💕 #serenawilliams #serenawedding #alexisohanian #tennis #wta #nola
