The funeral for Atatiana Jefferson was taking place Thursday in Dallas, not far from her home in Fort Worth where a police officer shot the 28-year-old in front of her young nephew earlier this month.
He tweeted about the National Day Of Outrage that was scheduled for Monday and invited participants to “Demand justice for Atatiana Jefferson & the countless Black women killed at the hands of police violence.”Today we lay Atatiana Jefferson to rest.
Jefferson was reportedly shot within four seconds of the officer arriving.
It was in the context of that horrible scenario that Atatiana Jefferson’s funeral was being held nearly two weeks after she was killed.
