Atatiana Jefferson, the 28-year-old who was shot and killed earlier this month while in her own home, is just one of many Black women who lost their lives during an encounter with law enforcement. The tragic trend has outraged activists, who announced a collective response to the violence on Thursday, the same day that Jefferson’s funeral was held.

UNTIL FREEDOM, a social justice organization that was founded by Tamika D. Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Mysonne Linen and Angelo Pinto will lead a day of action around the country on Monday. The National Day of Outrage will take place in at least 26 cities and will honor Atatiana Jefferson. The events will begin simultaneously at approximately 5:30 p.m. EDT and everyone participating is asked to wear black in the name of unity.

“It is absolutely outrageous to consider that less than one week after Officer Amber Guyger was found guilty of murdering Botham Jean in his home in Dallas, that another Texas police officer could fire with impunity into the home of another innocent Black person,” Mallory stated. “We demand answers, but more importantly, we demand change. We will not allow Black people to continue to be preyed upon by those committed to protecting and serving them.”

Though Jefferson is just one of the most recent examples of deadly police violence against Black women, she is far from the only victim. Names like Sandra Bland, Korryn Gaines, Charleena Lyles and Pamela Turner are just a few examples of Black women who met their untimely demises at the trigger-happy hands of police officers who ignored their training for de-escalating a situation and resorted to lethal force.
