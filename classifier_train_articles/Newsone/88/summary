ET —A new report further puts into question the president’s sincerity when he discusses his efforts to endear himself to the Black community.
The group also lists “Saving black babies from abortion and promoting crisis pregnancy centers” as one of “the policy initiatives of President Trump” that it promotes.
He bragged in November about the “grassroots” Black Voices for Trump group that includes Martin Luther King‘s niece alongside conservatives with polarizing opinions on everything from sexual assault to sexism to slavery.
He has made it a point to invite the Young Black Conservatives group led by Hitler-sympathizing Candace Owens to the White House each February to celebrate Black History Month.
But he and his campaign have apparently drawn the line at Black Americans to Re-Elect for allegedly misrepresenting its association with Team Trump.
