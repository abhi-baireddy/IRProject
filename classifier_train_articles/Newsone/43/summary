My running mate will be a woman.
Social media users weighed in on the discussion in no uncertain terms to say why they thought their preferred candidate would make a better running mate.
"Warren or Harris" Harris.
However, for VP, I would go with whoever the majority of black Democratic voters want.
I dont know why people are saying "Warren or Harris" Biden is almost certainly choosing Michelle Obama.
