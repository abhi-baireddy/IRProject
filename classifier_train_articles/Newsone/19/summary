MAGA pusher Kanye West has made his way to the Internet once again to questionable compare himself to a celebrated figure.
In a talk with GQ, West discussed his friendship with the late Kobe Bryant and basically said they’re one in the same.
“He was the basketball version of me, and I was the rap version of him, and that’s facts!” he said.
