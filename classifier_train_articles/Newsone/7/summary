If you check Twitter, you’ll only see the hashtag being used to counter Black Lives Matter, never on its own merit.
Black Lives Matter is all about uplifting all people by reminding them that nobody is safe until all marginalized people are safe.
Black Lives Matter has done more for white people than All Lives Matter has done for everyone.
Fox News, Candace Owens, Breitbart, Tomi Lahren and every Trump-adjacent ally in between has screamed out All Lives Matter at one point or another and only in response to shouting down Black Lives Matter.
But, beyond that, Giuliana himself had this to say about #AllLivesMatter: “It’s inherently racist,” he said about Black Lives Matter in 2016.
