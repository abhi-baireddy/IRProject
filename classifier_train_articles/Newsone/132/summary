But now a jogger, identified on YouTube as Henry Sintay, who is white, happened to think that it was okay to throw a Black homeless’ man’s clothes at a public park in Oakland on Friday.
Jogger Joe, as he is being referred to across the web, also tossed some of the man’s clothes in a trash can.
“I was just completely taken aback … This is a homeless man’s stuff – a guy who is always peaceful, never causing trouble, always giving you a smile.
It was also disturbing that the racist incident happened at Lake Merritt — the same park where BBQ Becky called 911 on people #BarbecuingWhileBlack.
For now, the Oakland Police Department was investigating the incident, but no one waited to help the homeless man.
