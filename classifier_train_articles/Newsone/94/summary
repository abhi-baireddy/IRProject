ET, April 14 —More than a month after Elizabeth Warren suspended her campaign for president, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts on Wednesday announced her endorsement of Joe Biden‘s candidacy.
Some of Warren’s supporters include racial justice groups and Black women, in particular.
Thus, Warren’s endorsement of Biden would theoretically only bolster his appeal to women as well as his existing popularity among Black voters.
Warren was able to win the support of Black activists, but that never translated into Black voters casting ballots for her during the primaries.
That shouldn’t have taken away from the impressive list of her Black women supporters, a group that has often been described as the backbone of the Democratic Party.
