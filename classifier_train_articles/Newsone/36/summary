Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, has called out the “lack of journalistic integrity” when reporting Black celebrity deaths, demanding that TMZ “ensure that families have been notified,” prior to reporting these deaths.
While the Bryant family waited for official confirmation of the worst news of their lives, TMZ was all too eager to capitalize on their loss.
TMZ had the responsibility to report factual information with integrity and they failed to that,” the petition says.
Color of Change condemned TMZ for reporting the rapper’s death prior to his family being notified.
The petition went on to mention the outlet falsely reporting that Lil Wayne was in a coma and on life support in 2013.
