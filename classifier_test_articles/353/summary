Which brings us to an intriguing little question about Rep. Gaetz's would-be witness bombshell: Just how is it that Matt Gaetz, Florida congressman, allegedly knows secret details of Donald Trump's ex-lawyer's home life?
Gaetz is not on the committee that will be hearing Cohen's testimony; he is, in this context, solely a bystander.
Who told Matt Gaetz about Cohen's private life?
Who might Cohen have confided in, if Gaetz's information is accurate?
Who gave Gaetz the information he is now using in his intimidation attemptâ€”and did that person give it to him with the understanding that he would expose it?
