(CNN) Karen Uhlenbeck, a mathematician and professor at the University of Texas, has been awarded this year's Abel Prize, a mathematics prize modeled after the Nobels.
It's the first time the prize has gone to a woman.
The Abel Prize is awarded by the King of Norway to mathematicians who have greatly influenced their field, and includes a cash award of 6 million Norwegian kroner (about $700,000).
The first prize was awarded in 2003.
One of Uhlenbeck's most famous contributions was her theories of predictive mathematics inspired by soap bubbles.
