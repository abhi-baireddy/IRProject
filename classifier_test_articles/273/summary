Vox Media is furloughing 9% of its staff from May 1 through July 31, with health insurance premiums being fully covered, a source familiar with the moves tells Axios.
Why it matters: It's one of the many media companies forced to take drastic measures to survive the economic fallout of the coronavirus.
Last week, Vox Media solicited donations from readers, foreshadowing its struggles.
In a memo to staff Friday obtained by Axios, Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff wrote: "The expectations that we had just a few weeks ago for our business and our lives no longer apply."
Be smart: The digital news industry has been reeling from a tough economic outlook for a while â€” and Vox Media laid off roughly 50 staffers in 2018.
