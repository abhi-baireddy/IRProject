Does the report confirm that Mueller found enough malfeasance to impeach Trump?
Both sides have hyped up the investigation to the point that Mueller's report can't possibly compete with the narratives.
Even if they find questionable actions and discussions within the Mueller report, their earlier hyperbole raised expectations so high that anything less will be dismissed as hardly worth the bother.
Trump may be banking on data from the Mueller report justifying accusations that the FBI did not have a valid predicate for the warrant or surveillance and that the operation was politically motivated.
If Mueller included that in his report, then Trump might get a big win â€” but if Mueller concludes that the FBI did have a valid reason to surveil Page, it's going to burst that narrative bubble in a hurry.
