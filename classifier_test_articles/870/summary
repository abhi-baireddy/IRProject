WASHINGTON – House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal escalated the fight over President Donald Trump's tax returns Friday afternoon when he issued subpoenas for the documents to Department of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig.
The Treasury Department had previously rejected Neal's request for six years of the president's tax returns.
Neal made the original request for Trump's 2013-2018 tax returns to the IRS, which is part of the Treasury Department.
It was the first such demand for a sitting president’s tax information in 45 years.
Neal also demanded copies of tax returns for Trump's trust and for his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
