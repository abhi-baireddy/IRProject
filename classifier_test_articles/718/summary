A supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wear mask with his likeness as they celebrate first exit poll results for the Israeli elections at his party's headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel, Monday, March 2, 2020.
Netanyahu, set to go on trial on corruption charges in two weeks, claimed victory after exit polls projected his Likud party as the largest faction in parliament in Mondayâ€™s election.
But while exit polls and preliminary results appeared to give him a boost, they also signaled that a year-long political deadlock is far from over.
Exit polls on Israeli TV stations also indicated the Likud-led bloc would capture 59 seats.
If the final results match the exit polls, Netanyahu would have several options.
