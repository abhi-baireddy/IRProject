byAmericans have come to embrace recycling their trash with an almost religious fervor, but in some sense they are praying to a false god.
As they are a pain to rumble out to the curb, I’m sometimes tempted to deposit our one or two waste bags in a neighbor’s cart.
As waste paper becomes less valuable, fewer recycling haulers want to handle it, and those that do may charge municipalities more for the privilege.
Think about potato chips, which once came in wax or coated paper bags; now many are sealed in metalized Mylar (PET) pouches.
