One imagines that Senator Dianne Feinstein would like a do-over of her colloquy with some young people on Friday afternoon.
A group of school students, at least one as young as seven, went to the senator’s San Francisco office to ask her to support the Green New Deal climate legislation.
Then, when the group persists in supporting the Green New Deal, which was introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Feinstein responds, “You know what’s interesting about this group?
The beauty of the Green New Deal legislation is not that it’s shiny or progressive or a poke in the eye to the oil companies.
The Green New Deal was hatched by the Sunrise Movement, which is composed of recent college graduates.
