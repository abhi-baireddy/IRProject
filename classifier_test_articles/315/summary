If Democrats really feared Donald Trump's exercise of the powers of the presidency, why would they propose extending the surveillance powers of the controversial Patriot Act?
If you take those comments seriously, that's a hell of a guy to trust with the powers granted by the Patriot Act.
Even in that environment of fear, lawmakers included a sunset provision in the Patriot Act, meaning it would expire after four years.
The 2011 and 2015 reauthorizations occurred under Democratic President Barack Obama, with Biden as vice president.
This year's proposed reauthorization of the Patriot Act isn't exactly a one-off; last year, donkey party leaders kneecapped an effort in the House by dissident libertarian-leaning Republicans and liberal Democrats to roll back some of the more intrusive elements of the Patriot Act.
