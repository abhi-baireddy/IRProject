Asked for his legal opinion after meeting with a Department of Justice lawyer at a Tuesday luncheon of the GOP conference, McConnell said, “I haven’t reached a total conclusion.”ADVERTISEMENTMcConnell said while he graduated from law school, he’s not an expert on constitutional questions of separations of power.
“We had a very fulsome discussion of this issue in the conference at noon today with the vice president,” McConnell added.
He described his GOP colleagues as “extremely interested” in the topic.
“We really do think there’s a crisis at the border,” he added.
McConnell said it will come up for a vote on the Senate floor before the recess scheduled for mid-March.
