Intel will abandon the market for smartphone 5G modem chips, the company said on Tuesday.
The news came on the same day that Apple, Intel's customer for 5G modem chips, settled a lawsuit with Qualcomm relating to the technology.
But, when it comes to the smartphone modem business, CEO Bob Swan said in a statement, "it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns."
Apple had previously selected Intel to supply the modem chips for its future 5G smartphones.
But Intel said in its announcement on Tuesday that it "does not expect to launch 5G modem products in the smartphone space."
