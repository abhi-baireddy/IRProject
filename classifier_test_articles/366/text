The governor in June 2019 appointed a cannabis working group, whose members included both advocates like Kaltenbach and a county sheriff. The group issued a 16-page report detailing its recommendations.

State Rep. Javier Martinez, D-Albuquerque, who introduced the bill last year, said in local interviews that he plans to introduce a bill that draws from the working group’s recommendations.

The bill would immediately expunge cannabis possession convictions. It also would direct some tax revenues to a so-called “Medicaid for marijuana” program to subsidize medical marijuana purchases for low-income patients. The bill would also seed small businesses, fund substance abuse treatment, and direct 35 percent of tax revenues to a new fund for public health programs, job training and housing subsidies.

The New Mexico Sheriffs’ Association has not announced opposition to the bill. The measure would create a new fund for state law enforcement underwritten by 16.5 percent of the revenue from taxes on cannabis sales. The bill also would direct 10 percent of the fees the state collects from licenses and penalties from life, general casualty and title insurance business to the police’s new fund.

Northeastern states’ cannabis coalition

New York Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo threw his weight behind a push for legal cannabis in his State of the State address coinciding with the legislative session’s Jan. 8 start. Cuomo has said he wants legalization incorporated into fiscal 2021 budget negotiations in March.
