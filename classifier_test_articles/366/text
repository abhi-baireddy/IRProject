President Trump once again criticized Fox News on Tuesday over its town hall with Senator Bernie Sanders, this time claiming that the network did not allow his supporters into the audience.

‘Many Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the Fox News Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders.

‘Big complaints about not being let in - stuffed with Bernie supporters.

‘What's with Fox News?’

‘Many Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the Fox News Studio last night in the now thriving Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders,' Trump tweeted. ‘Big complaints about not being let in - stuffed with Bernie supporters. ‘What's with Fox News?’

When contacted by DailyMail.com, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to local news reports which indicated that Trump supporters did, in fact, sit in the audience at the Sanders town hall on Monday. Trump supporters are seen above holding signs in Bethlehem on Monday

The Sanders town hall, which was a ticketed event, drew significant interest and was sold out

'Socialists can’t come up with facts to back their theology,' said Janis Mikofsky of Allentown, who was in the audience. The above image shows Trump supporters in Bethlehem on Monday

When reached by DailyMail.com on Tuesday, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to the fact that this was a ticketed event and had a diverse audience, including supporters of Trump, Sanders and independent voters.

Martha MacCallum, the Fox News anchor who co-hosted the event along with network colleague Bret Baier, told The Morning Call on Monday that various local and political groups in the Bethlehem area were invited to attend.

The day after the event, The Morning Call quoted at least two Trump supporters who were in the audience.

'Socialists can’t come up with facts to back their theology,' said Janis Mikofsky of Allentown.

Fox News, the Rupert Murdoch-owned cable news channel hosted Sanders, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist who is running for the Democratic Party nomination for president, for a town hall on Monday in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

'It results in misery.'

Mikofsky, who identifies as a conservative and a Trump supporter, says she attended the town hall.

The Rupert Murdoch-owned cable news channel hosted Sanders, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist who is running for the Democratic Party nomination for president, for a town hall on Monday.

The event was held at ArtQuest Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Sanders’ town hall meeting set record ratings for Fox News and now Democratic breakout star Pete Buttigieg is moving to hold one of his own.

President Trump posted two more tweets about Sanders on Tuesday. The president is seen above at the White House on Monday

‘Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income,' the president wrote. ‘He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him'

Trump also predicted that Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden would be the last two candidates left to fight for the party nomination

Sanders' Monday night event was 'the most-watched town hall of the season' with 2.55 million viewers, Fox News said in a statement on Tuesday, citing early Nielsen Media Research reports.

Fox News's town hall beat CNN's February town hall with Sanders in total viewers, the network crowed.

And Buttigieg, who shot to national acclaim after an appearance at a CNN town hall at South by Southwest in March, is looking to hold one on Fox.

A campaign spokesperson told The Hill that talks are happening as 'reaching out to the Fox audience is something we intend to do.'

Trump posted two more tweets about Sanders on Tuesday.

‘Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income.

‘He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him.

‘They made a fortune off of Trump, but so did everyone else - and that’s a good thing, not a bad thing!’

The tweet about Sanders’ income was a reference to the tax returns that the senator from Vermont released on Monday.

Sanders late Tuesday responded to Trump’s tweets. ‘Looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign,’ the senator from Vermont tweeted. ‘He should be.’

The 10 years of tax returns provided details of Sanders’ growing status as a millionaire fueled by a sharp jump in income from book royalties since his losing 2016 White House run.

Sanders, a U.S. senator who routinely rails against the “millionaires and billionaires” he says have rigged the system to protect their wealth and power, had an adjusted gross income of $561,293 in 2018, $1,131,925 in 2017 and $1,062,626 in 2016, the returns showed.

He augmented his Senate salary with book royalties in each of those years, particularly in 2016 and 2017 when he made more than $800,000 each year in royalties.

Sanders has published three books since the start of his first White House run, including bestsellers Our Revolution and Where We Go From Here.

In 2014, the year before he launched his first presidential campaign, Sanders had an adjusted gross income of $205,271.

Sanders had faced mounting pressure to release his taxes, with critics saying the democratic socialist’s millionaire status undercut his populist economic message. He has made no apologies for his financial well-being.

‘It comes from a book I wrote, pretty good book,’ Sanders told the Fox News Channel town hall on Monday.

‘If anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a best-selling book, I’m sorry, I’m not going to do it.’

Trump followed up with another tweet about Sanders on Tuesday, writing: ‘I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)!

‘I look forward to facing whoever it may be.

The audience erupted in cheers when Fox News host Bret Baier, who co-hosted the town hall with Martha MacCallum, asked the audience if they would prefer a universal healthcare system

Trump dubbed Sen. Bernie Sanders as 'Crazy Bernie' and slammed the audience from Monday's two hall, saying they were too 'smiley and nice' to the Democratic Socialist

‘May God Rest Their Soul!’

Sanders late Tuesday responded to Trump’s tweets.

‘Looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign,’ the senator from Vermont tweeted.

‘He should be.’

On Monday, Trump slammed 'crazy Bernie' for touting universal healthcare and tax hikes during his town hall.

Trump said the the audience and co-host Baier were humoring Sanders by being 'smiley and nice' during the event.

'So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the 'audience' was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile?' Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.

The president was referring to the evening's viral moment when the Independent senator from Vermont faced off with the hosts about who would pay for a universal healthcare system.

The rust-belt audience was surprisingly receptive to Sanders' socialist healthcare proposal.

'Senator, this audience has a lot of Democrats in it. It has Republicans, independents, Democratic Socialists, conservatives. I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here, a show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance, right now?' Baier asked.

More than half the audience for Fox's town hall raised their hand in the impromptu poll.

'OK. Of those, how many are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?' Baier asked, which was met with even more hands raising and cheers from the audience.

Sanders, who represents Vermont in the Senate, identifies as a Democratic Socialist and says healthcare is a human right and should be free.

Baier's co-host, MacCallum, asked how Sanders where the money would come from for a government-run healthcare system.

'I think everybody is in agreement that healthcare needs to be fixed in this country,' MacCallum said.

'You're going to pay one way or the other,' MacCallum rebutted. 'Whether it's in your income tax or your payroll tax.'

'Health care is not free,' Sanders conceded.

'Of course not, you just said it's going to be free for everyone.' MacCallum shot back.

'It's going to be free of the point of when you use it, OK? Why are you so shocked by this?' Sanders asked.

'Somebody is going to pay.'

Sanders is the only Democratic candidate that has had a town hall with Fox News in the 2020 cycle so far.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand, also running for the Democratic nomination, have appeared on the network's signature evening news program 'Special Report.'

Democrats will hold 12 primary debates to whittle down its massive field for the 2020 presidential nomination, the party announced in December, six primary debates in 2019 and six in 2020.

It's considered quite a coup for a network to be chosen to host a debate, which generally garners large viewership and offers a prestigious national platform for the network's political team.

So far only two debates have been awarded by the party: one to NBC (along with sister networks MSNBC and Telemundo) in June in Miami and one to CNN in July in Detroit.
