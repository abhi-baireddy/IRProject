Cohen told a House of Representatives committee he had no direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Moscow during the election campaign.
Assailing the president as a “conman” and a “cheat”, Cohen said Trump knew ahead of time about WikiLeaks’ release of emails in 2016 that undermined Democrat Clinton’s presidential bid.
Cohen said Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., co-signed another check, again for $35,000.
Trump has previously denied knowing in advance about the release of hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election.
Cohen said Trump on multiple occasions inquired about the Moscow real estate project while telling the public he had no business dealings in Russia.
