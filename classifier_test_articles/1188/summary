Billionaire heiress Ivanka Trump - someone who has never in her life faced unemployment - thinks Americans don't want to be "given something" like guaranteed jobs.
One of the provisions of the Green New Deal is the guarantee of "a job with a family-sustaining wages."
Ivanka Trump bizarrely assumed that only people who were unwilling to work needed a guarantee of employment.
The fact that she has never had to work a day in her life was not lost on anyone.
"They want the ability to be able to secure a job," says Trump.
