President Donald Trump issued the second veto of his administration to block a vote from Congress to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.
The Senate voted 54-46 in favor for the resolution while the House of Representatives voted 247-175.
The administration issued a scathing statement rejecting the resolution and accusing the Congress of trying to undermine his executive authority.
The president issued his first veto of legislation out of Congress in March when they voted to block his declaration of a national emergency on the border.
Congress is not likely to have the votes to override the president's veto, which would require 2/3rds support of each of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
