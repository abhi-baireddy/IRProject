Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is quickly parlaying his time in President Donald Trump’s cabinet into a lucrative private career.
He’s landed a more than $100,000-a-year post at a Nevada mining company and is pursuing involvement in natural gas exports that have surged under Trump, Zinke told The Associated Press Tuesday.
“We’re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward” on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone.
Regarding natural gas exports, Zinke described his interest in the industry only broadly and declined to disclose any company or entities he’s working with.
“So we’re looking at overseas markets for LNG (liquefied natural gas),” he said.
