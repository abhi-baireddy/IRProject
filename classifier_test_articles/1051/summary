On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that immigration officials can detain illegal immigrant criminals at any time after their release from jail.
In a 5-4 decision, the conservative majority overturned a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said immigration officials must arrest such illegal criminals immediately upon their release from jail, within 24 hours.
The Court ruled against them, enabling federal immigration officials to detain such immigrants at any time after their release from state or local custody.
Ultimately, Alito wrote, "neither the statute's text nor its structure"support the immigrants' argument.
The Court upheld the Trump administration's argument against hearings for those convicted of crimes â€” an argument the Obama administration also made.
