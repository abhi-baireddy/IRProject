It is unclear what other American citizens on the Trump campaign, if anyone, were spied on by their government.
Barr referenced controversial spying on American citizens during the Vietnam War, which led to reforms in the laws governing such spying.
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr said.
And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there’s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance.
He said that while there was no evidence of spying, such spying on political opponents is a totally normal and accepted practice.
