Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia CommonsIn February 2017, Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolinaâ€™s 7th congressional district introduced the Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act.
Devin Nunes is listed as one of the 65 co-sponsors of the bill.
That would assuredly eliminate frivolous suits, but it would also eliminate valid ones by heightening the financial investment and risk tolerance required to initiate them.
But Devin Nunes apparently likes frivolous law suits because he just filed one.
There is zero chance that a public figure like Congressman Devin Nunes will prevail in court.
