President Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, the new Brazilian leader dubbed the Trump of the Tropics, pledged cooperation Tuesday in opposing Venezuela’s socialist government, even as both took aim at a pillar of democracy: the media.
“I’m very proud to hear the president use the term fake news,” Trump said moments later.
In another similarity to Trump, Bolsonaro has been beset by a number of corruption controversies, a backlash over an offensive tweet and low approval numbers.
“We do agree with President Trump’s decision or proposal on the wall,” Bolsonaro said, in remarks translated to English by Fox.
