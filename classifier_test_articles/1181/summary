NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the globe fell on Wednesday as a continued flight from healthcare shares dragged on Wall Street, overshadowing upbeat economic data from China.
“Healthcare’s lagging right now, and that’s pure regulatory risk,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
MSCI’s emerging market stocks index, by contrast, maintained a 0.3% gain on the strength of the Chinese data.
In commodity markets, copper touched a nine-month high on strong Chinese economic data and ended 0.9% higher at $6,556 per ton.
