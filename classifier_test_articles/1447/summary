President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart, President Jair Bolsonaro, were full of praise for each other during the latterâ€™s first visit to the White House on Tuesday.
Both Bolsonaro and Trump have styled themselves as law-and-order leaders who have promised to crack down on crime.
By comparison, the number of murders in the United States in 2015 (the most recent year data is available) was approximately five per 100,000 people.
This, however, has not stopped Trump from repeatedly fear-mongering about crime in the United States, particularly when it comes to immigration.
Trump and Bolsonaro share another notable similarity: both men are facing creeping political scandals that have stymied their presidencies.
