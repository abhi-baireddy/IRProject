Democrats are blocking an attempt to give small businesses a $250 billion boost.
At first glance, it’s a surprising move, since Democrats support providing more funding to small businesses and workers experiencing severe economic trouble caused by the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.
But the answer is simple: Democrats want to use the leverage they have in Congress so that Republicans don’t just approve more money for small businesses while leaving out other programs that also desperately need more funding.
This approach was evident Thursday when Senate Democrats blocked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s attempt to pass a standalone small-business funding bill via unanimous consent.
But it’s a sign that Democrats are willing to use their leverage to push for more comprehensive stimulus for workers and businesses.
