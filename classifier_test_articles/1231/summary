The House passed a resolution Tuesday evening to terminate President Trump’s declared emergency at the southern border, passing the baton to the Senate, where the resolution faces tougher odds.
The measure passed the House easily, 245-182, given that Democrats control the chamber, but 13 Republicans bucked leadership and Trump to vote for the resolution.
The handful of Republican defections was not particularly surprising, as some members of the party have already signaled their disapproval of Trump’s national emergency declaration.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) notably backed Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency in order to find funds to build a border wall.
Trump has threatened to veto the resolution, and it’s doubtful that enough Republicans in the Senate will back the resolution to ensure a veto-proof majority.
