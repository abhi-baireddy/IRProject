Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s public Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight Committee has quickly proven contentious.
Still, at the very beginning of Cohen’s Wednesday appearance, GOP Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan attempted to pressure Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)
into postponing the hearing because Cohen had supposedly stuck it to the the GOP minority in submitting his opening statement hours after it would be traditionally required.
Although it’s not a secret what the committee’s party breakdown is, the GOP sought a recorded vote on their motion to postpone the hearing anyway, which failed.
Once the hearing actually got underway, Republicans again kept on with their intimidation efforts.
