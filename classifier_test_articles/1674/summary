And yet, 100 years from now, Obama’s presidency will be hailed as the most transformative of our lifetimes, and Donald Trump’s will be viewed with the same scorn that followed the Dred Scott decision.
ADADLast week’s slaughter of Muslims in New Zealand was allegedly committed by a fascist who claimed to draw inspiration from President Trump, among others.
After the 2017 riots in Charlottesville, Trump proclaimed a moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and their opponents.
These are just a few of the racially charged offenses that Trump committed even before Americans elected him president.
That’s why any policy differences I had with Obama now seem so insignificant.
