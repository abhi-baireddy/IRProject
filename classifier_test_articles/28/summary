(CNN) Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach agreed Tuesday to postpone the Olympics until 2021.
The Olympic torch procession scheduled ahead of the Games has now been canceled.
'Only logical option'Andrew Parsons, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President, says the decision to postpone the Olympics Games was "the only logical option."
The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games had been scheduled to take place from Tuesday August 25 to Sunday September 6.
"Postponing the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games as a result of the global COVID-19 outbreak is absolutely the right thing to do," Parsons said in a statement.
