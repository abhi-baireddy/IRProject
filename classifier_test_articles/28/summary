Record river flooding is now affecting six US states across the central Great Plains and the Midwest.
As of Sunday, 40 locations have reported new record-high river levels across the states of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
While some upstream rivers have begun to recede, rivers downstream are expected to rise further, with some reaching major- or record-flood stage later this week.
At its highest point, the Missouri River was expected to crest at around 14.5 metres, beating its 2011 record by more than 30cm.
The rain is not expected to be heavy, but the soil is already saturated and rainwaters will drain into swollen rivers.
