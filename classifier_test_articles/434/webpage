They described just the sort of circumstances that Florida legislators had in mind when they approved that state's "red flag" law in 2018, three weeks after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.</p><p>Morgan's estranged wife, Joanie, claimed he was depressed, suicidal, and obsessed with the apocalypse, which he thought was imminent. She said he was stockpiling food, gold, guns, and ammunition in anticipation of the end times; that he talked about seeing, hearing, and wrestling with demons; and that he had performed a ritual that involved rubbing "oils" on their children and the walls of their house. She reported that he was abusing the drugs he had been prescribed for chronic pain, had talked about dismembering his former wife, had intimated he would do the same to her if she ever disrespected him, and had threatened to kill her with succinylcholine, a paralytic agent used during surgery and intubation.</p><p><img class="alignright wp-image-8049207 size-medium" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20291'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="300" height="291" data-credit="Wikimedia" data-lazy-srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-300x291.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-1024x994.jpg 1024w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-768x745.jpg 768w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-1536x1491.jpg 1536w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-2048x1987.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-lazy-src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-300x291.jpg" /><noscript><img class="alignright wp-image-8049207 size-medium" src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-300x291.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" data-credit="Wikimedia" srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-300x291.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-1024x994.jpg 1024w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-768x745.jpg 768w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-1536x1491.jpg 1536w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/succinylcholine-vial-Wikimedia-2048x1987.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></noscript>On the strength of such claims, Joanie Morgan obtained a temporary domestic violence protection injunction, an involuntary psychiatric evaluation order under the Florida Mental Health Act (a.k.a. the Baker Act), and a temporary "risk protection order" under the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.401.html">red flag law</a>, which authorizes the suspension of a person's Second Amendment rights when he is deemed a threat to himself or others. All three were ex parte orders, meaning they were issued without giving Kevin Morgan a chance to rebut the allegations against him.</p><p>But when it was time for a judge to decide whether the initial gun confiscation order, which was limited to 14 days, should be extended for a year, Morgan got a hearing, and the lurid picture painted by his wife disintegrated. By the end of the hearing, in an extraordinary turn of events unlike anything you are likely to see in a courtroom drama, the lawyer representing the Citrus County Sheriff's Office, which was seeking the final order, conceded that he had not met the law's evidentiary standard, and the judge agreed.</p><p>This bizarre case vividly illustrates why legal representation and meaningful judicial review are necessary to protect gun owners from unsubstantiated complaints under red flag laws, which 17 states and the District of Columbia have <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERPO_Table_1-9-20.pdf">enacted</a>. But it also shows that police and prosecutors, who in Florida are the only parties authorized to file red flag petitions, are not necessarily diligent about investigating allegations by people who may have an ax to grind. That problem is especially serious in the states that allow petitions by broad categories of individuals whose accounts may be colored by personal animus, including current or former spouses, lovers, and housemates as well as in-laws and close or distant blood relatives. Without adequate safeguards, respondents can <a href="https://reason.com/2019/10/06/states-are-depriving-innocent-people-of-their-second-amendment-rights/">lose their constitutional rights</a> based on little more than an aggrieved individual's unverified assertions.</p><h2>'It Wasn't Him That Had Gone to the House'</h2><figure id="attachment_8049206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8049206" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-8049206" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="300" height="300" data-credit="Florida 5th Judicial Circuit" data-lazy-srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit-150x150.jpg 150w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-lazy-src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit.jpg" /><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-8049206" src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" data-credit="Florida 5th Judicial Circuit" srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Circuit-Judge-Peter-Brigham-FL-5th-judicial-circuit-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></noscript><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8049206" class="wp-caption-text">Circuit Judge Peter Brigham</figcaption></figure><p>Circuit Judge Peter Brigham issued the <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-ex-parte-risk-protection-order-9-18-18.pdf">ex parte risk protection order</a> against Morgan on September 18, 2018, six months after Florida's red flag law took effect, in response to a petition by Rachel Montgomery, a detective with the Citrus County Sheriff's Office. It was the first time the sheriff's office had used the law.</p><p>In the affidavit supporting her petition, Montgomery said she responded to a complaint from Joanie Morgan alleging that her husband had violated the temporary domestic violence protection injunction by returning to the house in Citrus Springs they used to share and retrieving clothing, medications, "several firearms," and his Ford Mustang. Montgomery paraphrased the claims Joanie Morgan had made in her petitions for the injunction and the Baker Act examination: that "the respondent has had a decline in mental stability over the last four months" and "has displayed irratic [sic] behaviors to include making threats to dismember a former paramour and threats to kill his entire family while yielding [sic] a vial containing a paralytic agent." She added that "the respondent has purchased several firearms and ammunition during this time period."</p><p>At this point, Montgomery later testified, she had done no investigation beyond talking to Joanie Morgan and reading her petitions. Montgomery said she subsequently discovered there was no basis for the claim that Kevin Morgan had violated the injunction by visiting the house. "I determined that it wasn't him that had gone to the house," she said. "It was actually a pool maintenance worker that had been by the house." Furthermore, "the firearms had been transferred prior to his risk protection order" in response to the domestic violence injunction, meaning there were no guns for Morgan to retrieve from the house.</p><p>Montgomery did read the Baker Act petition that led to Morgan's court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, but she did not mention the outcome of that evaluation. On September 13, 2018, police handcuffed Morgan and took him to The Centers, a mental health facility in Ocala, where he spent the night. The next day, a psychiatrist determined that he did not meet the law's criteria for involuntary treatment. A discharge form dated September 14, 2018, described Morgan as "alert and oriented" and "calm and cooperative." It explained that "Kevin was evaluated by the psychiatrist and it was determined that Kevin does not present as a danger to himself or others."</p><p>Yet here was Montgomery, four days later, asserting that there was "reasonable cause to believe" Morgan "poses a significant danger of causing personal injury" to himself or others "in the near future." Judge Brigham agreed, and there was no reason to think he wouldn't. <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190507-Risk-Protection-Orders-March-2018-through-March-2019.pdf">Statewide data</a> indicate that Florida judges always grant petitions for ex parte risk protection orders.</p><p>A follow-up mental health report from The Centers, written two days after Brigham approved the temporary risk protection order, described Morgan's appearance as "appropriate," his behavior as "compliant," his mood as "stable," his thought process as "organized," and his judgment and impulse control as "good." Based on prescription records and a drug screen, Stefanie Glover, a licensed mental health counselor at The Centers, reported that Morgan was "displaying no drug abuse." She also said Morgan "did not display any signs or symptoms of paranoia, psychosis or delusions." In the "trauma" section of the form, Glover typed: "Client is being mentally and emotionally abused by his wife. Client stated that he filed for a divorce on Monday September 17th, 2018."</p><p>Glover's conclusions about Morgan jibed with an August 29, 2018, letter from his personal physician, Ulhaus Deven. "He has shown no sign of abusing the opioids prescribed to him," Deven wrote. "He has not had any indication of depression or suicidal ideation."</p><h2>'This Puts Us in an Awkward Situation'</h2><p>On September 28, 2018, 10 days after Brigham issued the temporary risk protection order, he held a hearing to determine whether there was "clear and convincing evidence" that Morgan  posed "a significant danger" to himself or others. That is <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.401.html">Florida's standard</a> for issuing a final risk protection order, which lasts up to a year and can be renewed for another year.</p><p>At the hearing, the sheriff's office was represented by its lawyer, Robert Batsel, while Morgan was represented by Crystal River attorney J. Michael Blackstone. I listened to the official audio recording of the hearing, which lasted about two hours and 20 minutes. It included testimony by Kevin Morgan, Joanie Morgan, and her mother as well as Detective Montgomery.</p><p>In addition to refuting the claim that Kevin Morgan had violated the domestic violence injunction, Montgomery described him as "very calm" when he was taken into custody for the Baker Act examination. Responding to questions from Blackstone, she said Morgan was polite and cooperative, neither raising his voice nor behaving erratically, and seemed to be in control of his faculties.</p><p>Joanie Morgan's testimony was tearful, highly emotional, scattered, and frequently vague. She reiterated her earlier allegations and added a few more. But when Blackstone asked whether she had any evidence to corroborate what she claimed her husband had said and done, she admitted that she did not.</p><p>There were no witnesses to confirm his alleged threats and no photographs of oil on the walls, of the hypodermic needles he allegedly had stashed away to inject the succinylcholine, or of the food, gold, weapons, and ammunition he allegedly had accumulated in preparation for the end times. Nor had police ever visited the house to confirm any of those details. Blackstone also noted that, despite Joanie Morgan's portrait of her husband as dangerously deranged, she was planning to build a new house with him on property they had purchased together in April 2018, and she had left her children overnight with him that August, in the midst of his supposed breakdown, to attend a conference in Tampa.</p><p>Joanie Morgan's mother, Susan Harper-Clements, tried to back up her daughter's portrayal of Kevin Morgan as dangerous, but the evidence she offered fell notably short. For example, she mentioned "conversations" after the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. "Kevin had told me that the NRA&hellip;was all into this gun thing and that you couldn't even buy the bullets you wanted, because people were stockpiling," she said. "And he said, 'When they're all through with this, you won't be able to buy guns and ammunition.'" On cross-examination, Blackstone noted that such comments hardly proved homicidal intent. "He has never threatened anyone in your presence, has he?" he asked. "No," Harper-Clements replied.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-8049210 alignright" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20342%20274'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="342" height="274" data-credit="Walmart" data-lazy-srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart.jpg 342w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart-300x240.jpg 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" data-lazy-src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart.jpg" /><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-8049210 alignright" src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="274" data-credit="Walmart" srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart.jpg 342w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Colt-Navy-1851-percussion-revolver-Walmart-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /></noscript>Kevin Morgan's demeanor at the hearing was as Montgomery and the staff at The Centers had described it: calm, polite, and cooperative. He denied seeing demons, making threats, or obsessing about the apocalypse. He denied that he had recently been stockpiling guns, saying he had acquired his collection of roughly 40 rifles and handguns over the course of more than two decades. The only guns he had acquired recently, he said, were three black-powder pistols he had bought the previous spring and summer—antique replicas ill-suited for the end times.</p><p>What about the mostly empty vial of succinylcholine that his wife had presented to sheriff's deputies as evidence of Morgan's deadly designs? Morgan recalled that his wife, a nurse who had worked at two local hospitals, had once accidentally brought home just such a vial, saying she had put it in her lab coat pocket after participating in the treatment of a patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest. Morgan, who also has a nursing degree, had managed the emergency room at one of those hospitals, but he left that job in January 2015 because of a disability caused by spinal stenosis. After that, he no longer had access to drugs such as succinylcholine. Given the expiration date on the vial that his wife gave to police, Morgan said, it was clear he could not have been the person who had obtained it.</p><p>After the last witness testified, Blackstone asked Brigham to deny the petition by the sheriff's office. "The testimony, frankly, does not make any sense," he said. "There's no objective evidence for the court to base a ruling on. There's been ample opportunity. The police could have gone and looked at the inside of the house and verified that there were gold coins or gold bullion or oil on the walls or anything else. We basically only have the word of a woman that's in the early parts of a divorce. Most of the testimony has already been contradicted by Mr. Morgan. It's unpersuasive under any circumstances, and the standard is 'clear and convincing.' With all due respect to Mr. Batsel, who I think a lot of, I don't think he's carried that burden. At best, it's a swearing match."</p><p>At this point, Batsel got up and admitted that Blackstone was right. "I've conferred with my client," he said, and "they won't object to me tending to agree. This puts us in an awkward situation. The sheriff's office is coming into this with all the best intentions&hellip;The legislature has put us in a bit of a box, and that's OK; we're going to figure it out. But in a 'he said, she said,' where the evidence, I frankly will agree, does not meet 'clear and convincing,' we don't want to waste the court's time."</p><p>Blackstone thanked Batsel for his candor. "I can't tell Mr. Batsel how much I appreciate, in the world today, somebody standing up and just accepting what the facts are," he said. He also thanked the sheriff's office. "I think we're all learning as we go," he said. "It's a new statute. It's going to put huge burdens on everybody."</p><p>Brigham ratified the agreement between both sides that the sheriff's office had failed to make its case. "I don't think I've heard clear and convincing evidence," he said. "I found Mr. Morgan's testimony to be credible." Explaining his decision in an <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-petition-denial-9-28-18.pdf">order</a> he issued later that day, he said, "The issue came down to a credibility determination between the respondent and his current wife. The court found the respondent credible and that the petition was not proved by clear and convincing evidence. [Regarding] the only piece of physical evidence, a vial of drugs, [it] was never clearly, or convincingly, explained from whence it came."</p><h2>'You Have to Go in and Prove That You're Not Guilty'</h2><p>Blackstone, who supports red flag laws in principle, thinks Florida's statute worked as intended in this case. "I thought you had a well-intentioned police officer who sat on the stand and told the truth," he says. "I thought you had an exceptionally well-intentioned and competent attorney for the Citrus County Sheriff's Office who did a fabulous job. I thought I did a competent job in representing Kevin, and I thought that the law worked the way it was supposed to."</p><p>At the same time, Blackstone recognizes that it's important to have a lawyer in situations like this. "It's always dangerous to go into court without a lawyer," he notes. Without "competent counsel," he says, this case "might have turned out the same way," but "it might have turned out entirely different."</p><p>Florida, like nearly all of the states with red flag laws, does not provide court-appointed counsel for respondents. Colorado is the only state that guarantees a right to counsel for respondents who can't afford a lawyer or choose not to hire one.</p><figure id="attachment_8049236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8049236" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-8049236 size-medium" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20246%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="246" height="300" data-credit="KDM" data-lazy-srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-246x300.jpg 246w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-768x938.jpg 768w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2.jpg 786w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" data-lazy-src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-246x300.jpg" /><noscript><img class="wp-image-8049236 size-medium" src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="300" data-credit="KDM" srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-246x300.jpg 246w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2-768x938.jpg 768w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/03/Kevin-Morgan-2.jpg 786w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" /></noscript><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8049236" class="wp-caption-text">Kevin Morgan</figcaption></figure><p>Blackstone estimates that a single red flag case ordinarily would cost $2,500 to $5,000 in legal fees. Morgan says Blackstone, who also is handling his divorce, charged him about $1,500. That was on top of the attorney fees and extra living expenses he incurred as a result of his other legal battles with his wife. "I had about $13,000 or $14,000 in savings, and by the time all this was done, I had nothing," he says. "I was lucky to have a lawyer. I was lucky to be able to afford it."</p><p>Morgan's take on Florida's red flag law is less sanguine than Blackstone's. The law ostensibly puts the burden of proof on the agency seeking an order. But in practice, Morgan says, "you have to go in and prove that you're not guilty."</p><p>The automatic issuance of ex parte orders means that when a respondent gets his day in court, the playing field is slanted sharply against him. The judge is deciding whether to maintain the presumptively protective status quo or change course and give the respondent legal access to guns he might use to kill himself or someone else. That prospect tends to loom larger than the possibility that a respondent who does not really pose a threat will unfairly but temporarily lose his Second Amendment rights. Those dynamics help explain why judges in Florida <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190507-Risk-Protection-Orders-March-2018-through-March-2019.pdf">issue final orders</a> about 95 percent of the time.</p><p>Morgan's case nevertheless shows that the standard of proof matters. In the end, both parties and the judge agreed that the sheriff's office had not presented clear and convincing evidence. While that is the standard in most states with red flag laws, four states and the District of Columbia <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERPO_Table_1-9-20.pdf">require</a> only proof by "a preponderance of the evidence," meaning any probability greater than 50 percent. When laws combine a low standard of proof with undefined terms such as "a significant risk," "a significant danger," or "a risk of danger," the respondent does not have much chance of prevailing.</p><p>Another safeguard is requiring that petitions be filed by police or prosecutors, as Florida does. While anyone who knows a potentially dangerous person can still share his concerns with the authorities, police are supposed to act on those concerns only when they consider them well-grounded. The idea is to have dispassionate officials evaluate complaints from people who may have personal biases. But that goal is defeated if police simply record and pass along allegations by aggrieved parties.</p><p>Even allowing for Citrus County's inexperience with the red flag law at the time it sought the orders against Morgan, one has to ask why a law enforcement agency would go to court with a case so weak that its own attorney ended up throwing in the towel at the end of the hearing. Police should not seek ex parte orders without evidence of an imminent threat, and they should not seek final orders unless they are confident they can meet the law's requirements. Such caution is especially important when judges can be expected to rubber-stamp ex parte orders and approve nearly all of the final orders police request.</p><p>The possible cost of deciding not to seek or issue an order—a preventable suicide or homicide—has to be weighed against the certain cost of suspending someone's constitutional rights. Police should conduct a thorough investigation before trying to do that. In this case, easily discoverable facts—including the existence of Morgan's supposed hypodermic needles and end times stockpile, the whereabouts of his guns prior to the temporary risk protection order, and the provenance of the succinylcholine—were either not clarified until the hearing or remained unresolved even then.</p><p>The sheriff's office "jumped into a civil action without completing a proper investigation," Morgan says. "I don't think the average person understands just how dangerous these laws are. Hopefully, if my story can get out, folks will see how easily [red flag laws] can be used against someone for revenge or to get an upper hand in [a custody dispute]. I want people to know how these laws can be used improperly, in the hope that some reforms will take place. We need protection for falsely accused individuals and stiff punishment for those who abuse the system."</p></div><footer><p class="next-post-link"> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/reviving-congressional-reauthorization/" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-action="Next Article Click" data-ga-label="Reviving Congressional Reauthorization"><span class="next-post-next">NEXT:</span> Reviving Congressional Reauthorization</a></p><div class="rcom-author-footer"><div class="article-author"><p><span class="author-footer--author-name"><a href="https://reason.com/people/jacob-sullum/">Jacob Sullum</a></span> is a senior editor at <em>Reason</em>.</p></div></div> <span class="the-tags"><a href="https://reason.com/tag/gun-control/" rel="tag">Gun Control</a> <a href="https://reason.com/tag/red-flag-laws/" rel="tag">Red Flag Laws</a> <a href="https://reason.com/tag/gun-rights/" rel="tag">Gun Rights</a> <a href="https://reason.com/tag/second-amendment/" rel="tag">Second Amendment</a> <a href="https://reason.com/tag/due-process/" rel="tag">Due Process</a> <a href="https://reason.com/tag/florida/" rel="tag">Florida</a></span><div class="rcom-social-tools"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2F2020%2F03%2F05%2Fshe-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns%2F" target="_blank" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--facebook" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Facebook" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2F2020%2F03%2F05%2Fshe-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns%2F&text=A+bizarre+Florida+%E2%80%9Cred+flag%E2%80%9D+case+shows+the+importance+of+safeguards+that+protect+gun+owners+from+unsubstantiated+complaints.&via=reason" target="_blank" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--twitter" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Twitter" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2F2020%2F03%2F05%2Fshe-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns%2F&title=A+bizarre+Florida+%E2%80%9Cred+flag%E2%80%9D+case+shows+the+importance+of+safeguards+that+protect+gun+owners+from+unsubstantiated+complaints." target="_blank" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--reddit" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Reddit" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a><a href="mailto:?subject=Shared+From+Reason.com%3A+A+bizarre+Florida+%E2%80%9Cred+flag%E2%80%9D+case+shows+the+importance+of+safeguards+that+protect+gun+owners+from+unsubstantiated+complaints.&body=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2F2020%2F03%2F05%2Fshe-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns%2F" target="_blank" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--email" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Email" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a><a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/printer/" target="_blank" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--print" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Print" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fas fa-print"></i></a><span data-link="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/" class="rcom-social-tools--button rcom-social--copy-link" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Social Share Button Clicked" data-ga-action="Social Share Click - Copyurl" data-ga-label="article footer "><i class="fas fa-link"></i></span><div class="media-links"><a href="/media-contact/" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="Media Contact Link Clicked" data-ga-action="Media Contact Link Clicked" data-ga-label="article footer">Media Contact &amp; Reprint Requests</a></div></div><div id="comments"><p class="comments-header-show"> <a href="#comments" data-target="comments-collapse-8049172" data-ga-click="true" data-ga-category="View Comments" data-ga-action="View Comments Button Click" data-ga-label="She Said He Said He Saw Demons.

If a guy is accused of such a thing it still only makes sense to do whatever is necessary in the immediate moment to make sure nothing else happens to the kids, or to confirm or refute the allegations. Yes it sucks. But if the alternative is to do nothing to the accused what happens when the allegations are true. This law worked pretty well for a new law. As it is invoked more over time procedures and protocols can be refined to limit the damage caused by false allegations.

None. There&#8217;s minimal evidence that they may reduce firearm suicides slightly (although other forms of suicide tend to rise). Which begs the question, why are we bankrupting people and putting them through a wringer like this for no public safety benefit? Is it the role of the people to broad-brush remove 2A rights to prevent a small handful of people from taking their own life?</p><p>If you don&#8217;t have a problem with the law, you don&#8217;t know what is in the law and how it works. There is no accountability for anyone involved here. (You don&#8217;t even have to be a firearm owner to get an RPO.) The cops have *total* immunity. The spouse could potentially be charged with perjury, but it&#8217;s unlikely.</p><p>The RPO Act is a radical expansion of police power, no more and no less. It gives police additional ways to get into and search your home and car, no more and no less. It&#8217;s being used left and right against children and in highly questionable cases like this. And the most absurd part is that at least half involve a respondent who already has some kind of firearm restriction. The RPO petition is a totally superfluous proceeding.</p><p>Now, here&#8217;s another problem. These laws aren&#8217;t homogeneous across states. Each is somewhat different, and Florida&#8217;s is among the worst. If you get the sheriffs&#8217; lawyers in a private room they&#8217;d say the same. But people have a tendency to lump them all together as though there is some platonic form of Red Flag Laws floating out there that can be discussed. There isn&#8217;t.</p><p>The reason this happened isn&#8217;t because police need &#8220;more training&#8221; (god if I had a dollar&#8230;). It&#8217;s because the law is so sloppily drafted.</p><p>So thanks for your opinion, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to be based in adequate knowledge of the facts.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-3" id="comment-8156081" data-sort-time="1583465816"><div id="div-comment-8156081" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Tionico</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/#comment-8156081">March.5.2020 at 10:36 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>HERE is the outrage on these redflag laws:</p><p>HE gets his stuff taken and limits slammed down on him, then has to poy up what I would consider to be serious money to prove a negative, a VERY difficult thing to do.</p><p>To my knowledge only one state has anything approaching due process as a precursor to seizure or incarceration.

Liability for reports should be present IF AND ONLY IF the accuser acted with bad faith. Blatantly false accusations like the one in this case should lead to liability in both criminal and civil court. But a person who makes a report in good faith based on the standards of the law should not face liability just because the complaint turns out to be unfounded or insufficient to lead to a confiscation. While I completely disagree with these laws, there should be immunity from consequences ONLY for good faith reports. But failing to provide immunity for good faith reports is tantamount to invalidating the law entirely. If the law is going to be invalidated, let it be invalidated completely; not through fiat of fear of exoneration when a good faith report is made.</p><p>To me: Good faith means telling the truth and not exaggerating.

It is so easy to obtain a protection order in most states and it prejudices the courts in divorce hearing that divorce lawyers routinely advise the clients, especially females, to get one even if they don&#8217;t feel threatened because it favors them in the subsequent divorce hearings. My brother went through the same thing. His wife was cheating on him and set it up so that her liver confronted my brother when he got home from work. She then called the cops, went to an abuse shelter and filed a protection order against him, because he got angry with her lover. The Coeur d&#8217;Alene police even admitted it was likely he was the one being abused but the Post Falls department and the abuse shelter didn&#8217;t care, they still filed the protection order. Luckily he had a good lawyer and the judge was reasonable upon hearing the testimony of the responding officers. The judge actually scolded her, her lawyer and the abuse shelter in the court room for using the laws. Since the abuse shelter helped her flee the state afterwards, against Idaho law because she took the kids, the judge also told them the could be held as accessories to felony child abduction. Oh and the abuse shelter told us, me, my wife and my parents that we could call anytime to check on the kids but when I did call they turned me into the Post Falls PD who tried to file charges with the Anchorage (my wife and I Lived in Anchorage at the time) PD to try and file harassment charges which could have lost me my nursing license. Luckily the Anchorage PD told them to go piss up a rope (the detective who contacted me actually mentioned that this were nearly his exact words) but did warn me not to call them again, for my own safety. I should mention the Post Falls OD called me and harassed me and threatened me, despite the Anchorage PD telling them to pound sand. I promptly called their lieutenant who defended their actions. I also called the CDA PD, who told me they also were frustrated with the PF PD and that they were no longer cooperating with this certain abuse shelter because of this case and it was straining their relationship with the Post Falls PD. Their lieutenant told me he was calling their (PF PD) to tell them to back off but he didn&#8217;t think it would go anywhere because they had no authority, even though the incident took place in CDA, but because she was in Post Falls she was out of their jurisdiction. The CDA PD was also pissed when they found out she had left the state with the kids because they had specifically told her she couldn&#8217;t.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser even depth-2 parent " id="comment-8154554" data-sort-time="1583420022"><div id="div-comment-8154554" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>sarcasmic</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/#comment-8154554">March.5.2020 at 9:53 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>The system has been set up to favor women and mothers.

My brother dropped the charges and withdrew his divorce order (despite the lawyers advice) he thought it was best for the kids. She later cheated on him again and because Idaho is a joint custody state, he had to share custody and pay child support. Even after he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and was on disability they forced him to pay child support and threatened him with legal action after he fell behind. He was dying and the bitch still went after him for child support. Unfortunately, after his death she got custody. She eventually kicked out one of my nephews, who is a minor. My parents took him in but she refused to sign paperwork until the court forced her too, giving my parents custody, because she didn&#8217;t want to lose the social security check. My parents now adopted my nephew and he at least has a real shot at having a semi-normal life. His older brother is 18 and living on the streets, she forced him to skip school to work and despite us contacting CPS, nothing was ever done. He has no degree and is battling depression. My parents have offered to take him in, but he has refused.<br /> The youngest boy has been suspended multiple times for fighting and is barely not flunking out of school. CPS still doesn&#8217;t care, her current husband&#8217;s family is well connected with the Lewiston PD and they refuse to do anything about her despite the kids counselors, teachers and my parents all filing abuse charges.<br /> Her husband choked my one nephew, the one my parents adopted and all he got was unsupervised parole. The reason she kicked him out was because after the parole ended her husband put my nephew in a choke hold and my nephew bit him, so she kicked him out. She also kicked my brother&#8217;s step son out but Washington state police contacted Idaho State Police who forced her to take him back in because he was also a minor. Of course they didn&#8217;t arrest her or charge her. It is nearly impossible for grandparents to get custody if there is a living parent in Idaho. It is so fucked up. I now realize, along with all the stories of overzealous CPS cases, realize CPS doesn&#8217;t care about kids are actually in danger but like to go after more stable parents because they are more likely to be compliant.<br /> As a side note after my brother&#8217;s death she only took them to a month of counseling and then told them to get over it, to stop referring to my brother as their Dad but call him Scott and she insisted that they now call her husband dad. My one nephew refused, the one living with my parents. That is one of the reasons his step father abused him. She stopped taking them to counseling because the counselor wouldn&#8217;t take her side. She also doctor shops until she finds a doctor willing to prescribe medications to keep them under control. We have all of this documented, but still no luck with CPS. My nephew was on four or five different medications at the time my parents got him. All prescribed by different doctors for his anger control (gee I wonder why he was angry). When my parents took him to their doctor, the doctor said that those meds, at that strength should never be prescribed together, especially to a minor. He is now off all of his meds and is going to graduate on time (he was almost a year behind when my parents got custody) and has made the honor roll a couple of times. He plans on going in the Army, but because of medications she had prescribed for him he is having some difficulty getting a medical waiver, despite the fact that his current doctor said none were justified and we&#8217;re actually counter indicated. Oh and my parents got him actual grief counseling which is also a red flag for the MEPPS in Spokane. He is planning on moving in with us after graduation so he can go to the MEPPS here in Montana, where the physicians are more understanding. I guess the doctor at the Spokane MEPPS loves to DQ for health reasons recruits for just about anything. Several recruiters and friends of mine who are still in the Reserves back home, have told me she is a real bitch and makes up her own rules. But she is protected because of her longevity and despite multiple complaints nothing can be done. And people wonder why I distrust the government. Sorry for the rant.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-3 parent " id="comment-8154592" data-sort-time="1583421355"><div id="div-comment-8154592" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>sarcasmic</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/#comment-8154592">March.5.2020 at 10:15 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>Dude, I can empathize with a lot of that. I&#8217;ve been through the CPS wringer and you&#8217;re right that they don&#8217;t care about the kids. Just load them up with meds to make them compliant and make sure that mom gets custody. It&#8217;s all about empowering mom and punishing dad for being a man. In my case an individual clinician controlled the entire show. She hated me (she was a man-hater in general, so her hatred towards me wasn&#8217;t anything special) and made all kinds of false reports. She exaggerated anything bad I did while omitting the good, and did the opposite with mom. The lawyers and judge listened to her because she&#8217;s the licensed professional while I&#8217;m just the father. They completely ignored testimony from my parents because they&#8217;re not licensed professionals. Now my daughter is morbidly obese thanks to the medication. Her mom doesn&#8217;t interact with her at all beyond handing her a remote and a tablet. Meanwhile I&#8217;m paying their mortgage with the child support.

Yeah he is to sick to work and can&#8217;t afford his child support but he has $700 laying around to pay for new fees. On a side note the social worker in Lewiston was very sympathetic but her ha D&#8217;s were tied. She had even reported the mother to CPS but her boss told her to stop and just do her job. She apologized when two months before he died she was forced to make him pay the child support and the mother and her husband sat there gloating. And the new husband called him a deadbeat and told him not to get behind again. She kicked him out of the office and said &#8220;just take your damn money and shut up&#8221;. I should say at the time my brother was hooked up to a portable IV pump getting chemo, which wasn&#8217;t to save his life but just to prolong it a couple of months more. The doctors all agreed his cancer was way to advanced to treat successfully, the best they could do was give him some extra time, when he was first diagnosed. He was basically being treated for reflux and other stomach complaints for years before someone discovered it was actually colon cancer. No one looked for it because he was in his late 20s.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-6" id="comment-8154692" data-sort-time="1583423456"><div id="div-comment-8154692" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>sarcasmic</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/#comment-8154692">March.5.2020 at 10:50 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>This clinician reported me to CPS because my daughter said I spanked her when she was little, but hadn&#8217;t touched her in years.

It captures precisely the (ahem) reason we&#8217;re seeing astonishing growth in the numbers of counties installing 2nd Amendment sanctuary commitments. Florida has joined a small band of ignorant, tyrannical states that are shoving the U.S. to the brink of catastrophe.</p><p>The Supreme Court isn&#8217;t about to jeopardize its own reputation by reducing the ability of private citizens to defend themselves. It&#8217;s especially important because currently, half the nation&#8217;s murders occur in only 63 counties while the other half are spread across the other 3,081 counties. Said another way, 15 percent had one murder and 54 percent of the nation’s counties had no murders at all.</p><p>The obvious reason is federal and state resources alone are woefully inadequate to enforce such allegations and could not begin to undertake such efforts without local law enforcement assistance. If deputizing hundreds of thousands to actively resist federal and state efforts is representative of the whole movement, it’s a single issue rebellion which could rapidly expand.</p><p>Hundreds of counties already have proclaimed sanctuary status and almost 70 percent of the counties nationwide are projected to declare allegiance to the Constitution and refusal to enforce laws that violate it. That would comprise 472 counties with only one murder per year plus 1,700 counties that have no murders at all. If that materializes, a desirable result would force federal and state enforcement to concentrate on the 63 counties (2% of the total) where half of America’s murders occur.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="comment-8156490" data-sort-time="1583510913"><div id="div-comment-8156490" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Bayushi</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/05/she-said-he-said-he-saw-demons-then-he-had-to-give-up-his-guns/#comment-8156490">March.6.2020 at 11:08 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>What sucks about the Florida law is the lack of legal representation for the poor.
