Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

Overheard LA is an Instagram account that lightly skewers a certain strain of millennial culture that seems to flourish in Los Angeles.

Its founder, Jesse Margolis, started the account — which now has 1.2 million followers and seven spinoffs, including Overheard San Francisco — on a whim in 2015, after listening to a stereotypically L.A. conversation at a health food store.

Now, Mr. Margolis is steering the brand in a new direction, with (gasp) a printed “newspaper,” The Overheard Post, which features a “millennial weather report” and satirical “obituaries” for things like plastic straws.

The brand now has five staff members and employs freelancers.

Recently, I talked to Mr. Margolis about getting Overheard ready for life after Instagram. Here’s our conversation, edited and condensed for length and clarity:

Jill Cowan: Hi Jesse, thanks for taking the time to talk.
