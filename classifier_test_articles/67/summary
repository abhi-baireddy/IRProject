At the same time, the poll indicates that Americans are mostly unhappy with the amount of information that has been released so far.
Among Republicans, more now say Trump did nothing wrong at all (65% vs. 55% a month ago) and fewer say he did something unethical (27%, down from 37% a month ago).
Still, 61% of Americans say they believe the Justice Department has shared too few details so far with the public, and 55% think it has shared too few with Congress.
The poll shows that even with the Mueller probe complete, 53% say Congress should continue to investigate Trumpâ€™s ties with Russia, while 45% say Congress should not.
Similarly, 83% of Democrats say Congress should take steps to impeach Trump if he is found to have obstructed justice, even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with Russia, while 82% of Republicans say Congress should not.
