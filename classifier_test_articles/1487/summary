It's a $15 minimum wage.
https://t.co/lO0kHxRjko — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) February 25, 2019It all sounds so simple, and — dare we say — too good to be true.
What’s stopping companies from raising the prices of food/water/housing/etc if the minimum wage goes up?
For every dollar the minimum wage is increased, one FT position is lost.
But we’d expect nothing less from Kirsten Gillibrand.
