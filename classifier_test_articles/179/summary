A Brazilian national arrested for allegedly assaulting a man wearing a “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) hat was in the U.S. illegally, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials said.
“Deportation officers with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Team arrested Rosie Santos, an unlawfully present citizen of Brazil,” ICE said in a statement.
The victim, Bryton Turner, 23, told authorities Santos attacked him unprovoked because of his MAGA hat.
A video of the incident showed Santos approach Turner from behind before swatting his hat off his head.
“That’s the problem — the problem with Americans these days, people are just ignorant,” Turner said in the video.
