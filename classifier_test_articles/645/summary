Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is under intense criticism after claiming that 60 percent of the daily victims of cartel violence were drunk or under the influence of drugs.
During his Wednesday press conference, Lopez Obrador made the troubling claim addressing the rising cartel violence.
The statement comes amid multiple cartel territorial wars in once peaceful areas such as Baja California, Guanajuato, and Cancun.
In October 2019, Mexican authorities arrested one of the sons of infamous drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, however after the Sinaloa Cartel issued threats, AMLO ordered his release.
In a similar fashion, federal authorities and judges have become famous for releasing jailed traffickers and cartel bosses after their arrests are routinely ruled “illegal.”
