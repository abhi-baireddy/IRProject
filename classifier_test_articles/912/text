No House has ever voted to end an emergency declared by the president, until tonight. By a vote of 245-182 the House did just that. The measure now goes to the Senate. From The New York Times:

“House Republican leaders kept defections low after feverishly working to assuage concerns among rank-and-file members about protecting congressional powers and about the precedent that Mr. Trump could be setting for Democratic presidents to use national emergencies for their own purposes. Ultimately, 13 Republicans defected from the party line to vote for the one-page resolution.”

The question is will there be enough votes to overturn a certain presidential veto. The answer at the moment is probably not.
