The federal government is warning a former National Football League player's company to stop advertising his medicinal cannabis products as treatments for the novel coronavirus.
Turley insists that CBD, a popular non-psychoactive cannabis derivative, can cure the coronavirus.
In fact, Neuro XPF had an entire page of its website, headlined “CRUSH CORONA,” devoted to those claims.
The CRUSH CORONA page, which was active as late as March 29, has since been taken down.
“CBD CAN PREVENT AND CURE THE CORONA VIRUS!” he tweeted last month.
