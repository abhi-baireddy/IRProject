As lawyers filed in, those pressing the case against Trump seemed aware that selection had gone about as poorly as it could for their side.
Instead, Trump turned over day-to-day control of his businesses to two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.
Lawyers in the Maryland and D.C. case have noted that some state officials have signaled that they’re staying at Trump’s D.C. hotel in order to cozy up to the administration.
The situation is complicated further by the fact that D.C. and Maryland later filed a notice purporting to drop the case against Trump personally.
