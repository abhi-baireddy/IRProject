As climate change worsens, so does President Donald Trump’s denial.
On Friday, in an encounter caught on video, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won’t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey earlier this month.
The children pleaded with Feinstein to be “brave” and to think about their future.

But the California senator is the bigger threat to the left’s goal of slowing climate change before it’s too late.
