WASHINGTON â€” The House of Representatives passed two bills this week that would vastly expand background checks, but they will likely be blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate and President Trump.
On Wednesday the House voted 240-190 to require background checks for private gun sales, with eight Republicans joining most Democrats to support it.
The House bill passed Wednesday would expand mandatory background checks to nearly all gun sales.
Currently, federally licensed firearm dealers must perform background checks on a customer before selling a firearm, but about one in five gun sales are exempt from background checks.
This includes over 1,000 successful gun sales to people convicted of domestic violence offenses, 500 gun sales to people who were fugitives, and 120 gun sales to people currently under a restraining order for domestic violence.
