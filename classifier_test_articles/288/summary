The action against the Northwest Front that Fishman outlined is a strategy that Facebook occasionally uses to stop the most egregious and dangerous groups from using its tools.
The group had been organizing on Facebook and attempting to use the platform to recruit potentially sympathetic minds into the neo-Nazi group.
If we identify something that indicated that there’s potential for harm, we’ll take enforcement action,” Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook, added.
Fishman was light on a lot of details about what Facebook looks for in monitoring these types of groups.
“When we’re talking about terror groups and hate groups, ambiguity can be a useful tool.”The overall scope of the takedown was small, at 36 Facebook users, 10 Instagram users, nine groups, and nine pages.
