Together, the hotel industry’s “Big 6” — Hilton, Marriott, Choice, IHG, Wyndham, and Hyatt — have gobbled up a majority of U.S. hotel rooms.
But others would have featured competing hotels — think Hilton, Hyatt, or Wyndham — as well as online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline.
Competitor ads seem to have vanished altogether, and online travel agency ads are increasingly hard to find.
This type of searching and switching is essential for robust online competition — whether massive hotel groups like it or not.
State attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice, along with the Federal Trade Commission, have all signaled their desire to promote online competition.
