Larry Hogan said he hasn’t decided whether to challenge President Trump in 2020, but he might just want to sit this one out, according to political analysts and poll data.
“Of course you couldn’t win a Republican primary challenge today,” Hogan said.
William Weld, a former Libertarian who supported President Barack Obama, said he will challenge Trump but has so far barely registered in polls.
And Hogan would be in position to challenge Trump.
“Hogan would have the advantage of having a record of political experience that is fully independent of and distinct from President Trump,” Kromer said.
