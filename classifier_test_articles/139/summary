Donald Trump has different sets of revolving financial records to suit his various purposes.
According to his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, those records were as slick as the man who generated them.
Representative William Lacy Clay (D-MO) asked Cohen if there were times in his employment with the Trump Organization where CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Allen Weisselberg spoke to the media.
Then, he said:‘It’s based upon what he wanted to value the asset at.’Cohen said that Trump had a fluctuating set of financial documents.
The former personal attorney said that Trump had given Deutsche Bank higher numbers so that he could buy the Buffalo Bills football team.
