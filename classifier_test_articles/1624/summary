A federal judge handling a case centered around special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report criticized Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday, saying he has “created an environment" fostering concerns about transparency.
The judge’s words appeared to echo concerns about Barr that congressional Democrats have also expressed.
After ruling that he would not order DOJ to provide a copy of the Mueller report to BuzzFeed by Thursday, Walton set another hearing for May 2.
Barr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's report last month, which said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign.
The BuzzFeed case is likely just the beginning of a multi-front battle for the full Mueller report.
