Before you share something, ask yourself if doing so is constructive for everyone who might see or hear it.
Before you share a Facebook status or send a tweet, picture yourself standing at your local PTA, church, or community meeting.
Is what you’re about to share constructive for those folks, or will it make the situation worse?
