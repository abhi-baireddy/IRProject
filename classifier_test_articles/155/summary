Many women are left feeling defeated after Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the presidential race.
Warren spoke about the bind women candidates face while talking with reporters Thursday afternoon.
Women candidates were more than aware of this expectation, tailoring their speeches and rollouts to highlight their experience, policy bona fides, and track record of winning.
But these things were ultimately easier for primary voters to accept than almost all the women candidates when the Republican opponent is Donald Trump.
In 2018, Democrats’ efforts to retake the House were driven heavily by women candidates.
