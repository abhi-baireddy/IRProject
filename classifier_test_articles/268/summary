(CNN) The Trump Organization has accused a law firm of removing references about its long-term relationship with the company from its website as the organization alleges a conflict of interest over a lawyer from the firm working for a House committee that's investigating the President's company.
The Trump Organization said the description had been scrubbed from Kramer Levin real estate partner Jay Neveloff's biography.
A spokeswoman for Kramer Levin confirmed the description had been removed.
The reference in Jay Neveloff's bio was removed on Friday to avoid confusion," said Jennifer Manton of Kramer Levin.
She added that no lawyer at the firm is currently working on any Trump-affiliated matter.
