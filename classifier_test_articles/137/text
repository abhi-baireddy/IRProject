In what’s likely to be one of the most odd stories of 2019 (so far), there is new reporting out today that interns from the president’s 2018 economic budget report included “Bruce Wayne,” “J.T. Hutt,” and “John Snow” (misspelling of Jon Snow from Game of Thrones).

The information was shared via a tweet from former Labor Department and Council of Economic Advisers, Martha Gimbel.

The Economic Report of the President has revealed that the quality of interns at CEA is much better than it was when I was there….we never got cool ones like Steve Rogers, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Aunt May, and John Cleese pic.twitter.com/qELM2729os — Martha Gimbel (@marthagimbel) March 19, 2019

Gimbel now works as a research director for the job posting website Indeed.com. She says in her tweet:

‘The Economic Report of the President has revealed that the quality of interns at CEA is much better than it was when I was there. ‘We never got cool ones like Steve Rogers, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Aunt May, and John Cleese.’

Other fictional characters to appear on the list include John Cleese, Aunt May, Star Trek captain Kathryn Janeway. A fun, fictional group of CEA interns. But why? No one knows.

The report that was eventually released, contained 711 pages and still contained references to all of the fictional characters from Gimbel’s tweet.

Ironically, these ‘characters’ are stated as “providing invaluable help with research projects, including fact-checking.”

Fact-checking.

We’re not sure if someone is trolling the public here, but this almost seems to bizarre to be true. However, yes– this is real life.

In 2017 it was reported by various news outlets that Trump’s White House was struggling to fill hundreds of government positions. While it isn’t confirmed, we’re wondering if some of the positions were jobs such as White House Intern.

Per CNBC:

‘TRUMP IS EARLY IN HIS FIRST TERM AND HAS TIME TO FILL OUT THE GOVERNMENT. BUT IN A LEAN WHITE HOUSE PUSHING FOR A FLURRY OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY AND SHADOWED BY AN FBI PROBE, GETTING SKILLED INDIVIDUALS NOMINATED AND CONFIRMED COULD PROVE DIFFICULT.’

Nominations and confirmations aside, it seems the White House struggles with even filling roles for bottom-the-barrel interns.
