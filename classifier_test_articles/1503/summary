Cohen has pleaded guilty and agreed to provide evidence to prosecutors in two separate criminal investigations into Trump and those around him.
A person familiar with Cohen's planned testimony said he was prepared to testify about "criminal conduct" by Trump after he assumed the presidency.
The person, who was not authorized to speak publicly, declined to characterize the conduct but said it happened during Trump's first year in the White House.
He argued some of them weren't crimes at all, and he derided Cohen as a "liar" and a "rat."
Less than a year later, he became one of Trump's main antagonists, providing information to federal prosecutors in two criminal investigations focused on the president.
