Under pointed questioning from senators, the top U.S. general for homeland defense said Tuesday that he sees no military threat coming from the southern border with Mexico, but his focus in on 'very real' threats from China and Russia in the north.
President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency along the southern border to fund his proposed wall, and he plans to use Defense Department funds from military construction and counter-drug programs to pay for it.
O'Shaughnessy, who visited the southern border on Saturday with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, was careful to defer any assessment of the southern threat to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection.
Asked if it is a national emergency, he said, it is a 'national issue' that requires a 'whole-of-government approach.'
'The threat isn't military, and still we'll take $6 billion out of the defense budget to deal with it?'
