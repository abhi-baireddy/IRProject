And they’re doing us a huge favor: They reflect a lot of sunlight, preventing the planet from warming as much as it would without them.
And a new analysis using a sophisticated computer simulation warns that climate change may cause the disappearance of stratocumulus clouds in a century and a half.
That would rapidly add 8°C of warming, on top of the already-disastrous 4°C of warming above pre-industrial global averages that CO2 emissions would cause by that point.
“It’s quite clear at this point that the answer is clouds,” Matt Huber, a paleoclimate modeler at Purdue University, told Quanta.
Once clouds are taken out of climate simulations, the climate “goes over a cliff,” Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said.
