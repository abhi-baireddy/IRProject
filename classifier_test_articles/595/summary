In Davenport, Iowa this weekend, Sen. Cory Booker twice offered veiled criticism of the lighthearted way that two of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sens.
Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, have joked about their past use of marijuana.
There’s no difference between blacks and whites for using marijuana, or even selling marijuana, but blacks are almost four times more likely to be convicted,” Booker said.
The Democrat with the longest record of supporting legalization is former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who sponsored an El Paso City Council resolution in 2009 calling for marijuana legalization and a conversation about legalizing all narcotics.
