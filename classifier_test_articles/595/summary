Senate Democrats voted Thursday to block a $250 billion infusion of cash into small businesses suffering amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Democratic caucus denied unanimous consent to a bill floated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) that would have added the funds.
Democrats then offered their own bill, which would have included not just $250 billion for small businesses but an additional $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments—Republicans likewise objected.
A passed bill would have infused billions into small businesses that preserved their payrolls—businesses that now face further uncertainty amid dispute in Congress.
"Senate Democrats just blocked urgent money for a popular, bipartisan job-saving program which they themselves literally coauthored with us two weeks ago," McConnell wrote on Twitter.
