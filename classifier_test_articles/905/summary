People line up for taxi across the street from the New York Times building in New York City in 2013.
A remarkable thing happened Monday: The New York Times executive editor, Dean Baquet, actually had to answer questions about his paper’s very different coverage of sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh.
Let’s walk through the Times’ very belated report on the Biden allegations and Baquet’s defenses of that reporting.
Two Times reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, published a book on the Kavanaugh allegations.
We were constantly told that the Kavanaugh allegations should be judged by a low bar because the hearings were “a job interview” and he’d be confirmed to a powerful, life-tenured job.
