Shani Buggs is part of the new generation of gun researchers. When she went to school for public health seven years ago, she didn’t even know that violence was a subject she could pursue. She’s now a postdoctoral fellow at the gun violence center at U.C. Davis, studying interactions between drug markets, policing and urban gun violence.

Ms. Buggs said that the new money had not been her only motivator, but that it did make her feel more secure about her future. “It’s exciting,” she said. “What’s most exciting about it is that the increase in dollars will bring more researchers to the field.”

In an Upshot survey last year, researchers expressed interest in knowing more about many subjects, including the factors that lead individuals to commit gun violence — Ms. Buggs’s focus. They also sought research into how criminals obtain their guns and the effects of various gun policies, such as new state laws that allow courts to temporarily confiscate guns from people who are deemed a risk to commit violence. Such legislation has passed in 14 states — 11 since 2016.

Research publications on gun violence also appear to be rising, reflecting an enhanced interest by journal editors, not just scholars. “There’s new names on a lot of these publications,” said Ted Alcorn, an instructor at Columbia whose analysis of gun-related science publications over the past few decades was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. His study found that gun research had declined as a share of science research since the mid-1990s, but that it began to rise sharply in 2012, the year of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.

The C.D.C. effectively stopped funding original research on gun violence after the passage of legislation in 1996 (the Dickey Amendment) that barred the use of C.D.C. funds to “advocate or promote gun control.” Republican legislators had objected to government-funded research concluding that having a gun in the home increased the risk of harm. But even before the Dickey amendment, the C.D.C. spent just $2.6 million a year on gun violence research. The National Institutes of Health funds some gun-related research, but not much.
