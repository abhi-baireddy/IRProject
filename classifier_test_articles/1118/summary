Trump's plan is to reallocate, via national emergency powers, roughly $3.5 billion from the military construction budget in order to build the wall.
Last week, more than 200 members of Congress co-sponsored a resolution, originally introduced by Rep. Joaquin Castro (Dâ€“Texas), to block the national emergency.
Prior to the House's scheduled vote on the resolution Tuesday, Amash explained in detail why he opposes Trump's national emergency declaration.
"The president doesn't get to just declare an emergency for something that Congress has deliberated many times over the past several years."
Amash is chairman of the House Liberty Caucus, which announced its opposition to Trump's national emergency declaration on similar grounds.
