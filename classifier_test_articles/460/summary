When people have strong gender stereotypes, they are less likely to believe that gender disparity in the workplace is due to discrimination (Cundiff and Vescio, 2016).
Do we need to directly address gender bias in workplace communication through trainings or even sanctions?
Gender bias in the workplace leads to lack of communication towards women; workplace information being withheld from women; the unwritten rules of the workplace not being shared with women; and lack of face-to-face communication with women.
Consider that interpersonal communication can be more important than written communication, especially in regards to gender-specific topics in the workplace (Anderson, et al., 2015).
It is when we confront these disparities in workplace communication and dismantle gender stereotypes that women will have a greater chance in obtaining leadership roles.
