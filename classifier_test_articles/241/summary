Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli filed court documents Monday waiving their right to appear for an arraignment and entering not guilty pleas to the two charges against them.
Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli are charged with paying bribes to have their daughters designated as crew recruits to USC, even though neither of them is a rower.
Authorities say Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli helped create fake athletic profiles for the teens by sending Mr. Singer photos of their teens posing on rowing machines.
Ms. Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the sitcom "Full House," and Mr. Giannulli haven't publicly addressed the allegations against them.
Several other parents who were indicted alongside Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli have also filed court documents entering not guilty pleas.
