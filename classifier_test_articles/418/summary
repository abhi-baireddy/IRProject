New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described Friday as one of New Zealand’s darkest days and vowed to change the country’s gun laws.
It has exposed a range of weaknesses in New Zealand’s gun laws.
She led the campaign to reform Australia’s gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman shot dead 35 people.
The first thing that obviously comes to mind when an atrocity like this happens is the question of semiautomatic weapons.
And it made sense for New Zealand also to pass the same sort of gun laws that were being passed in Australia.
