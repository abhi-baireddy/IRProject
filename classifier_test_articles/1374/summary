Two protesters interrupted Buttigieg, who is openly gay, during a speech in Fort Dodge, Iowa, shouting about the two cities that the Bible says were destroyed by what it calls sinful acts, including sodomy.
They were both quickly shouted down by a crowd of 1,650 people chanting the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s name and escorted out of the area by security.
Feels like the numbers are on our side," he added after the second protester was removed.
When asked for further comment regarding the protesters, Buttigieg’s campaign directed The Hill to the candidate’s statements during the event.
However, Buttigieg had not fielded such public and personal attacks on his sexuality during his campaign until Tuesday.
