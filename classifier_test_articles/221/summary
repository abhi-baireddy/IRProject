The husband of a US soldier killed in Afghanistan was deported last week until, just as his case began to catch national attention, immigration officials suddenly reversed their decision and allowed him back in.
“You end up traumatized,” Jose Gonzalez Carranza told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview Tuesday from Phoenix.
He and his attorney told BuzzFeed News they still have no idea why.
The deportation caught Gonzalez Carranza by surprise.
“He wasn’t going to leave Nogales,” Gonzalez Carranza’s attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, told BuzzFeed News.
