Washington (CNN) The Pentagon has identified two US Marines who were killed in Iraq on Sunday in what is being called one of the "most intense" battles US forces have been involved in recent months, according to the US-led coalition.
"This was one of the most intense clashes with ISIS that coalition troops have participated in in several months," Col. Myles Caggins, the chief coalition spokesman, told CNN.
The mission began with several dozen Iraqi counterterrorism forces, along with approximately a dozen special forces Marines traveled by helicopter to the area where intelligence showed 15 to 20 ISIS fighters had hidden.
As they got close to the target, they encountered stiff resistance from ISIS fighters largely equipped with small arms.
The two Marines were killed and three other Americans and one coalition member were wounded, essentially taking out the fighting capability of half the team led by the Marines.
