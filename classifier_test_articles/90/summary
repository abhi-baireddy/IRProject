Two men, both of Honduras, walk with attorneys as they cross into the United States to begin their asylum cases, Tuesday, March 19, 2019, in Tijuana, Mexico.
The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800,000 cases.
Critics say asylum seekers are forced to wait in unsafe environments and will struggle to find legal advice while in Mexico.
Lisa Knox, an attorney for two Honduran men, was in the courtroom and said three asylum seekers had expressed fear of returning to Mexico.
Mexico has said it will allow asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for humanitarian reasons.
