The shooting revealed serious shortcomings in how governments confront right-wing radicalism.
Right-wing radicalism, on the other hand, is called domestic terrorism if it is called terrorism at all.
Right-wing radicalism kills more Americans than Islamist extremism, and the government should pursue the threat with more vigor.
The United States and its closest allies share classified intelligence about al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
They should do the same regarding right-wing extremism, identifying links between terrorist networks, as well as information on how and where people are getting radicalized and who is radicalizing them.
