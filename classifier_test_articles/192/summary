The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is weighing designating fentanyl as a “weapon of mass destruction” (WMD).
“A little as two to three milligrams of fentanyl can induce respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and possibly death.
And some fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil are orders of magnitude more potent,” the February 22 memo from James McDonnell, the assistant secretary at DHS for countering weapons of mass destruction, noted.
Other DHS officials have warned that in the wrong hands, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl can be an effective weapon capable of killing millions.
“It is a weapon of mass destruction.”Despite the warnings from several independent and government officials, some officials believed designating fentanyl as a WMD is unnecessary.
