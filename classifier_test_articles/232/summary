Two business associations in New Zealand say companies should stop advertising on Facebook after an anti-Islam terrorist used the platform to livestream his massacre at a mosque in Christchurch.
Facebook is one of several social media platforms scrambling to crack down on uploads of the video, which remained online for hours after the massacre.
New Zealand's state-owned Lotto told Reuters it had already pulled advertising from social media because "the tone didn't feel right in the aftermath of these events."
