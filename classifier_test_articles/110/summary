President Trump threatened Wednesday to circumvent the Senate and unilaterally name people to federal posts using recess appointments during the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump said he has the power to declare that both chambers of Congress are in recess so that he can make appointments and curtail Democratic opposition that has delayed judicial and other confirmations.
“The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments,” Trump said in a White House press conference.
If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.
These sessions prevent the president from making recess appointments.
