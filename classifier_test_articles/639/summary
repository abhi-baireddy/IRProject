The US death toll on Saturday climbed to 20,389, surpassing that of Italy, which is reporting 19,468 deaths, per Johns Hopkins.
At least 2,074 deaths were reported in the US on Friday, the largest increase in coronavirus fatalities the country has seen since the beginning of the outbreak.
Of the deaths reported Friday, 783 occurred in New York state, bringing the statewide death toll to 8,627, Gov.
That was a slight drop from the state's all-time high in single-day fatalities, which occurred Wednesday with 799 deaths.
