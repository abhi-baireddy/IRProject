Passengers stranded since Sunday night on a Los Angeles-bound Amtrak train in a remote and snowed-in part of Oregon said the train was moving again Tuesday.
The 183 passengers were kept on the train because the heavy snow had knocked out power in the town of Oakridge, the closest populated place to the train, Amtrak said in a statement.
There was enough food on the train for the passengers, the statement said.
