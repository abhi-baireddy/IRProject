In the testimony, Cohen will allege that, in 2016, he witnessed Trump taking a phone call from Stone, who was on speakerphone.
Cohen will tell Congress that he witnessed Trump Jr., in June 2016, tell his father: "The meeting is all set."
"So I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary."
CNN reported in July 2018 that Cohen was willing to testify to the special counsel that Trump knew in advance about the planned meeting at Trump Tower.
He also provides new details suggesting Trump was heavily involved in the pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project in 2016.
