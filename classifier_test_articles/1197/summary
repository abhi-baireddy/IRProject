Taylor University, a small evangelical Christian college in Vice President Mike Pence's home state of Indiana, faces criticism from students, alumni, and faculty who've voiced their opposition to the university's selection of Pence to deliver the 2019 commencement address.
Taylor University is not budging, according to James Garringer, a spokesman for the university:“Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence’s upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue.
Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue.
We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.”The university's refusal to rescind the invitation was praised by Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumni.
"The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe," he continued.
