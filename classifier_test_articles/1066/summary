White House Trump intensifies attacks on McCain: 'I never was a fan of John McCain, and I never will be'President Donald Trump on Tuesday ratcheted up his attacks on the late Sen. John McCain, again lashing out at the former lawmaker for his dramatic thumbs-down vote to repeal Obamacare in 2017.
“I never was a fan of John McCain, and I never will be,” Trump told reporters while sitting next to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in the Oval Office.
More than a year and a half after McCain cast his legendary vote on the Senate floor, Trump said the move made him "very unhappy."
“Our country would have saved a trillion dollars, and we would have had great health care,” Trump said Tuesday.
Trump also mocked McCain on Twitter for being "last in his class" at the U.S.
