Participants are asked to publicly take the pledge by announcing it on their own websites and issuing a press release.
"Immediate action is required to halt the COVID-19 Pandemic and treat those it has affected," the pledge states.
We therefore pledge to make our intellectual property available free of charge for use in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the impact of the disease."
The license is effective until one year after the World Health Organization declares the pandemic to be over.
Other participating organizations and institutions include Berkeley and UCSF's Innovative Genomics Institute, Fabricatorz Foundation, and United Patents.
