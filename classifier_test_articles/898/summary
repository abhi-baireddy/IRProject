“What does this mean for tomorrow and the next day?” asked Dana Gutwein, 34, who has a first grader and third grader in the Jefferson County Public Schools District, which includes Columbine.
At Columbine, students who were organizing a day of service to mark the 20-year anniversary saw their preparations eclipsed by emergency text messages from the school district, news alerts on their phones and dread.
“This week our message was supposed to be about love and recommitment,” said Rachel Hill, 17, a senior at Columbine.
“But now all the news surrounding Columbine is about fear.”Some parents said they told their children to play close to home on Wednesday.
Others shook their heads at how a threat from one teenager could keep half a million students home from school and throw an entire city into panic.
