No one should underestimate the urgent issues facing the United States and the world from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But fear about worst-case scenarios has at times obscured certain facts that should lend some optimism to whatâ€™s ahead.
First, the rate of increase in deaths from COVID-19 is decreasing, in the United States and in most countries.
