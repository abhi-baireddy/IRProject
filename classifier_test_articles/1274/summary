One sign of the cultural impact of the Wite-Out brand is that, like Kleenex, it has become a generic term.
Liquid Paper dates back to the 1950s, when Bette Nesmith Graham, a struggling divorced mother, took on typing jobs to make money.
In 1958, she patented Liquid Paper.
A year later, George Kloosterhouse and Edwin Johanknecht, searching for a product that wouldnâ€™t show up when a document was photocopied, developed Wite-Out.
From 2015 to 2016 to 2017, Bic, which makes Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex, reported that correction products increased in share from 5 to 6 to 9 percent of the global stationery market.
