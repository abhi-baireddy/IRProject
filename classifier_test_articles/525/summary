Joy Behar, a frequent and frenzied critic of President Trump, got the ball rolling by stating Mueller missed out on what would have been a “nail in the coffin” for the president.
“Can I say I was disappointed in the fact that Mueller didn’t actually interview Trump?” Behar asked her co-hosts.

“We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.
