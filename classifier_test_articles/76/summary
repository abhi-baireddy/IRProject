The withdrawal of Mark Harris could help Republicans try to keep the competitive 9th District seat by enabling the GOP to distance itself from the scandal.
State election officials grew concerned about reports that an operative working for Harris was illegally tampering with absentee ballots.
Republican David Blackwelder, a community college police officer who lives outside the 9th District, also announced his candidacy.
He was previously mayor of Charlotte, a part of which is in the congressional district.
It is generally against the law in North Carolina for anyone other than the voter or a family member to handle someoneâ€™s completed ballot.
