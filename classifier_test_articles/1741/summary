“This is one of the most significant indictments involving China’s alleged theft of technology,” said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
AD“The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government’s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide,” said Assistant Attorney General John Demers.
Aviation software and turbine technology are the two critical areas China faces challenges in developing its own world-class commercial and military aircraft, experts say.
The indictment alleges that they used GE’s trade secrets to advance their business interests in two Chinese companies that make turbine parts — Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech.
U.S. officials alleged that, through the two Chinese companies, Zheng and Zhang received financial support from the Chinese government and coordinated with Chinese government officials to enter into research agreements with state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies.
