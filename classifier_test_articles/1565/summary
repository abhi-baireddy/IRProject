Domestic workers in the US are taking advantage of the Roma buzz to raise awareness about their second-class status in the US workforce.
But even though domestic workers are in high demand, they are among the lowest-paid workers in the country, and most get no benefits.
Congress intentionally left out domestic workers from US labor lawsWhen Congress first passed federal labor protections in the 1930s as part of the New Deal, they excluded two groups of workers: domestic workers and farm workers.
So instead, they began organizing at the national level in 2007, launching the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
On Sunday, Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, attended the Oscars ceremony as Cuarón’s guest.
