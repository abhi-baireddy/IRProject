Attorney General William Barr issued an order Tuesday that could keep thousands of asylum seekers locked up indefinitely.
The order, a reversal of existing policy, would affect asylum seekers who enter into the country in between legal ports of entry, by barring immigration judges from granting bonds for their release.
Asylum seekers who enter the U.S. at official ports of entry are already unable to be released on bond.
The order is set to go into effect in 90 days.
Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process.
