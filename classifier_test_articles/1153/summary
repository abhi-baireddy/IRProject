The Hanoi meeting was Trump’s second meeting with Kim in eight months and he appeared to reiterate recent statements that he was in no rush.
Trump and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, but there has been little progress since.
Kim said they had overcome obstacles to meet a second time and praised Trump for his “courageous decision” to begin a dialogue.

North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize,” Trump said on Twitter ahead of the meeting.
