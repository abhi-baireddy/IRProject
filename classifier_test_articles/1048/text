On Wednesday, President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testified that he has never traveled to Prague or the Czech Republic, contradicting the infamous Trump dossier.

"Have you ever been to Prague?" Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) asked Cohen.

"I've never been to Prague," Michael Cohen said.

"Never have," Norman repeated.

"I've never been to the Czech Republic," Cohen added.

"I yield the balance of my time," Norman concluded.

Many voices encouraged Republicans or Democrats on the House Oversight Committee to ask about Prague.

Has anyone asked Cohen about Prague? I may have missed it. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 27, 2019

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested a question: "Did you go to Prague -- or anywhere else -- to coordinate or collude with the Russians as claimed in the Steele dossier?"

Cohen has confessed to lying to Congress, but he seems to have no motive to lie in this regard. He has clearly decided to "turn" on President Trump, but he still rebutted a central claim of the Trump dossier, that Michael Cohen met with Russians in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic.
