It’s not surprising, then, that news of a black lung epidemic in Appalachia has failed to capture the public’s sympathies.
In 2016, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirmed a resurgence of black lung, a preventable occupational disease, in central Appalachia.
The documentary also happened to air just weeks before the fiftieth anniversary of an event not well remembered outside of Appalachia: 1969’s black lung strikes.
Congress strengthened provisions relating to black lung in 1972 in a separate act of law, the Black Lung Benefits Act.
But successive administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have allowed the coal industry more and more leeway to do exactly that.
