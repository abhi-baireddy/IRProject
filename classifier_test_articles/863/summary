Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will continue to lead the Likud party after a stunning victory in a snap primary election.
In his victory speech Friday, Netanyahu thanked all those who had braved stormy weather to go out and vote for him.
“They know that I give my life for the country and my victory is their victory,” he said.
“This is a tremendous victory because we also overcame the fake polls and fake news that is already trying to dwarf the victory,” Netanyahu added.
Out of 106 polling stations across the country, Netanyahu won 99 of them.
