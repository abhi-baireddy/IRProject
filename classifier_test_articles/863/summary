WASHINGTON — The 2019 Economic Report of the President runs 705 pages and features chapters on “expanding labor force opportunities” and “ensuring a balanced financial regulatory landscape.” It also claims to be written by Batman.
For the second straight year, the group of economists that do regression analyses and forecast annual growth rates for President Trump has slipped a straight-out-of-Comic-Con Easter egg into its annual report.
The list of Council of Economic Advisers interns on Page 624 of the report includes Steve Rogers (a.k.a.
Captain America), Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Bruce Wayne (Batman).
The names stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers interns are university students — depending on which movie or comic you prefer, Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fits that bill — and also, real human beings.
