White House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony, officials said.
ADADSuch a move will intensify a power struggle between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats, potentially setting up a protracted court battle.
ADPublic testimony from McGahn could create a spectacle that would parallel the June 1973 testimony of President Richard Nixon’s former White House counsel, John Dean, whose live televised appearance before a Senate committee painted a vivid portrait for the country of the White House coverup of the Watergate burglary.
ADPeople close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is “following the process” and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump’s public and private anger about his former counsel’s prominence in the Mueller report.
While initially portraying the report as an exoneration, Trump has grown frustrated with its depiction of his White House.
