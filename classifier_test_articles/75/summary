Increasingly people are dying of infections that once were easy to treat because many common bugs have evolved to withstand multiple antibiotics.
Balasa has a genetic disease called cystic fibrosis that scars her lungs and traps bacteria inside, including a superbug named Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

For two small studies, the researchers recruited cystic fibrosis patients who had antibiotic-resistant pseudomonas in their lungs but werenâ€™t openly sick.
His sister died of cystic fibrosis and while his own CF is under control, he worries that one day a resistant infection will flare.
