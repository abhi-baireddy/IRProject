Michael Strauss just wanted the oil workers to get paid appropriately for their dangerous, demanding jobs.
And on Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Parker Drilling Management Services vs. Newton, an appeal of Strauss’s class action lawsuit against Parker Drilling, a now-bankrupt offshore oil platform operator.
California wage law requires employees to be paid for such “on call” time, but Parker Drilling employees were paid only for their 12-hour active shifts and not for the standby.
The oil industry, however, is not distracted.
The petitioners say the entire oil industry has much to lose—“hundreds of millions,” according to them—if the Supreme Court doesn’t do this.
