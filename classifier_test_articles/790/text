First lady Melania Trump was both cheered and loudly booed by students when she appeared Tuesday in Baltimore to speak at the B’MORE Youth Summit on Opioid Awareness.

Video showed that the first lady got the mixed greeting as she was introduced at the DEA-sponsored event at the University of Maryland Baltimore County — and again when she finished speaking.

It was unclear why the crowd of roughly 1,300 middle and high school students were booing the president’s wife.

But President Trump has repeatedly criticized the city while feuding with late House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings prior to his death Oct. 17 at the age of 68.

The first lady appeared to take the mixed reception in stride — smiling and waving to the crowd — as she had already been greeted by protesters outside the school’s Event Center.

“Thank you to all of the students who are here. I am so proud of you for the bravery it takes to share that you have been strongly affected by the opioid epidemic in some way. This is an issue that has impacted many lives in your community,” she said.

“I hope that the knowledge you gain here will help you tackle the tough decisions you may be faced with, so that you can live a healthy and drug-free life.”

She also touted her “Be Best” initiative that aims to stop bullying.

“I hope that in the days and weeks ahead, you will think about what you learned here today and consider choosing one action that could help you or someone you know struggling with addiction,” the first lady continued.

“Get involved and be a part of the solution. Talk to your family and friends about what you have learned and help them understand how they too can be part of this powerful movement.”

The event also featured a showing of “If Only,” a film co-produced by James Wahlberg, brother of Mark and Donny.

The Baltimore City Health Department said that in 2017, the city saw 761 drug- and alcohol-related intoxication deaths, 692 of which were opioid-related — more than twice the number of those killed in homicides, WBAL-TV reported.

The CDC says that from 1999 to 2017, more than 400,000 people have died from overdoses — the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the US.
