SHOW TRANSCRIPTMembers of the House oversight committee criticized the White House Tuesday after former security official Carl Kline didn't show up for his scheduled testimony.
Chairman Elijah Cummings said he'll seek a vote to hold Kline in contempt of Congress.
In a press release, the committee said the White House ordered Kline not to appear.
The committee wanted Kline to testify on White House security clearances, a topic of interest in its investigation into why the White House allegedly ignored certain security procedures.
