There’s a surprisingly big disconnect between how obesity researchers think about the causes of and treatments for obesity and how the American public does.
Here’s the thing, though: Weight loss surgery is far and away medicine’s best treatment for severe obesity.
The lap band surgery is not a great weight loss surgery.
After three years, sleeve patients lost 26 percent of their original bodyweight while bypass patients lost 28 percent.
“The obesity epidemic did not occur because we don’t have enough surgery,” said National Institutes of Health obesity researcher Kevin Hall.
