House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday called for another bill to expand the provisions in the $2 trillion package Congress passed last week to limit the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic.
But it's not enough," Pelosi told CNBC's Jim Cramer after the government employment report showed the U.S. economy lost 701,000 jobs in early March as businesses started to shut down.
In the interview on "Squawk on the Street," the California Democrat said she wants more direct payments to individuals, beyond the chunks of up to $1,200 lawmakers just approved.
She pushed for more small business loan funding on top of the $350 billion in the last law, and to extend beefed up unemployment insurance for two more months.
