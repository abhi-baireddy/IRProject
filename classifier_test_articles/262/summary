(CNN) Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Ivanka Trump on Tuesday after the senior White House adviser said she doesn't think most people believe in the freshman lawmaker's proposal for guaranteed jobs for all Americans.
In response, Trump said, "I don't think most Americans in their heart want to be given something."
"I've spent a lot of time traveling around this country over the last four years," Trump continued.
They want the ability to live in a country where there's the potential for upward mobility."
On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Trump's dismissal of a guaranteed living wage.
