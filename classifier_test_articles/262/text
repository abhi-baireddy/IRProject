(CNN) Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Ivanka Trump on Tuesday after the senior White House adviser said she doesn't think most people believe in the freshman lawmaker's proposal for guaranteed jobs for all Americans.

In an interview released by Fox News on Monday, Trump was asked about Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal proposal and what she would say to people who are enticed by the proposal's job guarantee. In response, Trump said, "I don't think most Americans in their heart want to be given something."

"I've spent a lot of time traveling around this country over the last four years," Trump continued. "People want to work for what they get, so I think this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want. They want the ability to be able to secure a job. They want the ability to live in a country where there's the potential for upward mobility."

On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Trump's dismissal of a guaranteed living wage.

"As a person who actually worked for tips & hourly wages in my life, instead of having to learn about it 2nd-hand, I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live," Ocasio-Cortez posted on Twitter. "A living wage isn't a gift, it's a right. Workers are often paid far less than the value they create."
