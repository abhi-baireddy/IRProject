A student from London, England, is being praised for her kit that would make men be able to "chestfeed" children in order to overcome the gender inequality of women-only breastfeeding.

Marie-Claire Springham explained on Good Morning Britain that the devices

"So, basically the way I designed it is new couples when they find out they're expecting sign up to basically a pre-natal course," she explained.

"And they receive a kit in which it contains a nine months of a drug called progestin," she added, "which we know as the non-estrogen based birth control pill."

That drug is meant to "stimulate the production of milk-producing glands" in the males who take it. Another drug regimen would then result in lactation.

The kit also includes a pump and compression vest.

However, the "chestfeeding" kit is just theoretical at this point â€” Springham has not actually tried to do it on any subject.



Despite the kit not even really existing yet, Springham has already received an award for challenging, "the fundamental meanings of male and female, father and mother, parent and child."

"At a time when we increasingly use hormones, medication and technology to change the life options available to us, Marie-Claire's design concept goes right to heart of our taboos."
