Rep. Mark Meadows brought in a former Trump staffer as a guest to refute the claims of racism by the president’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen during a Wednesday hearing at the House Oversight Committee.
Mr. Meadows, North Carolina Republican, introduced Lynne Patton, a former staffer and current official at the Housing and Urban Development, as his guest.
“She says that as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was racist,” Mr. Meadows said.
He later asked Mr. Meadows to ask Ms. Patton: “How many people who are black are executives at the Trump administration?”“The answer is zero,” Cohen said.
Mr. Meadows asked for Ms. Patton’s testimony to be submitted as evidence, which chairmen Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat, approved.
