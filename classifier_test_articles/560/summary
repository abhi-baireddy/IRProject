News of the letter was first reported by Milwaukee-based TV station CBS58.
The letter was sent by Jacobs and Thomsen individually rather than by the entire six-member elections commission, which includes three Democratic and three Republican appointees.
Tony Evers (D) called for delaying the contest and abruptly convened a special legislative session on Saturday.
But at the session, the state legislature refused to take up a proposal to cancel in-person voting in Tuesdayâ€™s elections.
In their letter, Jacobs and Thomsen said that more than 1.2 million absentee ballots had been requested but that only a little more than 703,000 had been returned as of Sunday morning.
