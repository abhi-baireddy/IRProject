Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign launched like a rocket.
Sanders’ impressive start would not have been possible without the foundation he laid during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
But unfortunately for Sanders, he’s carrying over something else from his remarkable 2016 campaign: baggage.
The good news for Sanders is that it’s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway.
Sanders may have to lug his 2016 baggage with him into 2020, especially if a candidate of color and/or a woman emerges as his most direct challenger.
