The Electoral College limits the campaign playing field.
Popular voting expands it: ANALYSIS Elizabeth Warren said she supports getting rid of the Electoral College.
Support for the popular vote has risen as Americans have witnessed, in the last 20 years, two presidents win the Oval Office while losing the national popular vote.
Already, a number of states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which a stateâ€™s electoral votes would be assigned to whoever won the national popular vote.
Another way to make the popular vote matter, while retaining the Electoral College, is to adopt the Maine and Nebraska model.
