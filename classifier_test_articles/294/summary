American electricity generation has gone from 50 percent coal-based to 28 percent in a decade and is projected to be just 17 percent in 30 years.
This, of course, has been made possible by American production of natural gas, which has skyrocketed as a source of electricity generation.
American production of natural gas had been completely level for about 40 years before the fracking revolution began.
The fracking revolution enabled a greater use of natural gas for American energy needs, and natural gas is by far the cleanest fossil fuel.
It does not start with transferring control of world gas production to bad state actors such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.
