The Treasury Department responded to Republican senators’ request for highly sensitive financial records related to Hunter Biden, according to a report, placing “’evidence’ of questionable origin” to the lawmakers.
Charles Grassley, Ron Johnson, and Lindsey Graham and were sent to a number of federal agencies, including the State Department, Justice Department, and the Treasury Department, among others.
And now it seems the senators are getting some answers, according to Ron Wyden's office, the ranking Democratic senator on the Finance Committee.
“Applying a blatant double standard, Trump administration agencies like the Treasury Department are rapidly complying with Senate Republican requests — no subpoenas necessary — and producing ‘evidence’ of questionable origin,” Wyden spokesperson Ashley Schapitl told Yahoo News in a statement.
On Wednesday, Grassley and Johnson said in a letter they are also looking at Hunter Biden’s “government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business.”
