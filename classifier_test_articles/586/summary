Many Americans are expecting a check from the federal government within the next month, as part of a stimulus package intended to provide the country financial relief as COVID-19 stresses physical and financial health around the world.
Retirees and those who claim Social Security are a part of that group, though they may face some complications, experts said.
The checks are based on all income, which means retirees, Social Security and those who claim other benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income, are eligible.
The Internal Revenue Service said earlier this month people who claim Social Security will not need to file a tax return and that the government will use their Form SSA-1099 statements to generate the payments.
They will get to keep the full amount of the check, said Jeffrey Levine, director of advanced planning at Buckingham Wealth Partners.
