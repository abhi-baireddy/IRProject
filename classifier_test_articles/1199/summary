Earlier today, President Donald Trump referred to Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as "Crazy Bernie" in a tweet following a Fox News town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, during which Sanders drummed up support for Medicare for All.
The president, according to a New Yorker report published last month, ranks Fox News hosts based on their loyalty to him.
“A show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance right now.”Most audience members raised their hands.
“There’s 180 million people on private insurance, and they would be lost, right?” Baier continued.
But several polls, including one conducted by The Hill in October 2018, show that the majority of Americans support Medicare for All.
