It’s very emotional for me as a former sex worker,” said Gentili, an advocate for sex workers’ and transgender rights.
“We will decriminalize sex work.
For many, sex work may not be good work, or always free of exploitation, and it may be resorted to as a means of survival.
And, as the advocates and elected officials pushing for sex work decriminalization make clear, any feminist and workers’ rights movement worthy of the description would be a failure if sex workers are excluded.
Thus, to ignore the struggle for sex workers’ rights is de facto to allow their lives not to matter.
