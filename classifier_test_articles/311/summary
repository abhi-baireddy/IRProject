Members of the House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Friday calling for the economy to be reopened, as businesses across the country continue to struggle.
Measures enacted by Congress have provided limited relief,‚Äù the House Freedom Caucus members wrote in the letter.
Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen both were on the Senate floor and voiced their opposition, saying there needs to be more focus on small businesses.
Members of Congress are working on legislation to fund small businesses, however most are still mostly back home for recess.
The full House and Senate are not expected back to Washington D.C. sooner than May 4, making it harder for legislation to be passed quickly.
