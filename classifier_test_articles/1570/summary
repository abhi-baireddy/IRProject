After the first crash, the FAA learned the plane’s flight control system could adjust the plane’s horizontal tail, pushing down the plane’s nose, to a much greater degree than the initial documents stated.
The flight control system has now been implicated in two fatal plane crashes: the Ethiopian Airlines crash last week that killed 157 people and the Lion Air crash in October that killed 189.
The FAA and Boeing have pledged to implement a “software enhancement” for the flight control system by April.
This included the crucial decision not to train pilots on the new flight control system or mention it in flight manuals because it was only supposed to take control in extreme circumstances.
In a separate 2012 report, the department’s IG found that agency managers’ alleged close relationship with Boeing was creating unrest among FAA employees.
