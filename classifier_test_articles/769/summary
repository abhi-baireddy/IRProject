None of the Democratic 2020 contenders currently talking up reparations for slavery is serious about the project.
Those of them who are serious about anything are serious only about winning the party’s nomination and the role that flattering a small but influential congregation of left-wing intellectuals might play in that.
It’s an unserious proposal, but we’ll do its authors the courtesy of offering a serious answer, anyway.
Paying reparations for slavery is a terrible idea because there is no one to pay reparations and no one to pay them to.
Talking about reparations is, in part, a way to avoid talking about that, because it’s of no help in the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary.
