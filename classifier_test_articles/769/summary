Gretchen Whitmer (D) has been hit with at least two federal lawsuits from residents pushing back on what they say are "draconian" mandates during the coronavirus pandemic, with one attorney likening her actions to "taking a sledge hammer to an ant."
The plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit claimed they "reasonably fear that the draconian encroachments on their freedom set forth in this complaint will, unfortunately, become the 'new norm.'"
David Helm, an attorney who represents four of the plaintiffs suing Whitmer, told WJBK-TV of the governor's executive order, "It's like taking a sledge hammer to an ant.
There is a way to do it appropriately without infringing on Constitutional rights like the governor has."
Along with the lawsuits, Whitmer has faced major pushback for her policies.
