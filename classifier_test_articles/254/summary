The American Legion built the so-called "Peace Cross" in 1925 to honor 49 local men who died serving in World War I.
"This Memorial Cross Dedicated to the Heroes Of Prince George's County who gave their lives in the great war for the liberty of the world," a plaque reads.
"As a memorial to all veterans, it only seems to represent -- the cross -- Christian veterans," Lowe told CNN in an interview.
But removing the arms of the cross amounts to disfigurement, lawyers for the American Legion argue.
The Trump administration supports the American Legion and urges the justices to take a historical approach to the case.
