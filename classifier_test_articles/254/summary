FactCheck.org Managing Editor Lori Robertson spoke with WHYY radio in Philadelphia about fact-checking the White House’s daily coronavirus task force briefings.
She was a guest on WHYY’s “Radio Times” on April 15 for a discussion on fact-checking and the challenge for the media in covering these briefings live, along with Mark Lukasiewicz, a former senior executive at NBC News and ABC News.
Robertson discussed several recent FactCheck.org articles debunking claims President Donald Trump had made in these briefings.
The president also made false statements about the drug hydroxychloroquine.
Trump claimed “studies” had suggested there are few novel coronavirus cases in “malaria countries” because of the use of hydroxychloroquine as an antimalarial drug.
