President Donald Trump issued the second veto of his presidency on Tuesday, nullifying a resolution demanding an end to his administration’s support for Saudi Arabia as it continues its devastating war on Yemen.
No one was surprised by the veto — had Trump wanted to comply with the resolution, he could have withdrawn support to Saudi Arabia at any time.
But the passage of the resolution was notable given that it had bipartisan support.
Seven Republican senators and 18 Republican House members voted for the resolution, in addition to all of the Democrats in Congress.
In vetoing the resolution, Trump lashed out at Congress for passing it.
