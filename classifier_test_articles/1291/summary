MSNBC's Ari Melber opened a segment on MSNBC by mocking Fox News for focusing on a criticism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that he found flippant, but his guest surprised him by agreeing with the report.
Melber was speaking with New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay about criticism aimed at Ocasio-Cortez over her lavish apartment residence and questions about whether it was within her district.
"It actually does matter that you do live in the district that you represent," she continued.
Melber interrupted her in order to swing the conversation towards a criticism of President Donald Trump instead.
"Well, look at you spitting hot fire," Melber stammered out, "the headline here, the New York Times, ah, New York Times reporter backing up the New York Post for accountability journalism as you put it, that's very interesting."
