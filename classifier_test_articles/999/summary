Even as legal experts were debating whether Gaetz would be criminally indicted for the tweet, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi took control.
Nancy Pelosi posted a tweet which didn’t even mention Matt Gaetz by name, yet nonetheless rather clearly called for the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gaetz’s tweet.
Matt Gaetz posted this tweet at 11:52pm eastern time: “Speaker, I want to get the truth too.
We expect the House Ethics Committee to open an investigation into Matt Gaetz over the felony he very clearly (and intentionally) committed with his original tweet.
We’ll also have to wait and see if prosecutors like Robert Mueller and/or SDNY decide to criminally target Gaetz for witness tampering.
