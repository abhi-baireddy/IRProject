(CNN) President Donald Trump just appointed himself America's judge and jury, casting even deeper doubts on whether the nation's impartial justice system can withstand his expanding political assault.
More than 2,000 former prosecutors have signed onto a letter calling on Barr to resign for facilitating the President's legal maneuvering.
Tuesday's moves were only the latest examples of Trump's willingness to use pardons for political advantage.
Kerik, Blagojevich and Milken were all convicted of offenses that the President has been accused of committing by his enemies.
Trump's swipe also represented an escalation of his war on government prosecutors in general -- four of whom walked off the Stone case after the Justice Department capitulated to his wishes last week.
