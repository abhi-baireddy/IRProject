The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the charges Tuesday.
SHOW TRANSCRIPTThe Justice Department has charged a pharmaceutical company and two of its executives over their alleged role in the U.S. opioid crisis.
This is the first time a major pharmaceutical distributor and its execs have been charged with drug trafficking in connection to the opioid crisis.
The Justice Department said RDC has agreed to a consent decree that would have the company essentially admit to the charges and pay a $20 million fine.
One of the executives has already pleaded guilty to all charges, and the other, if convicted, could face a minimum of 10 years in prison.
