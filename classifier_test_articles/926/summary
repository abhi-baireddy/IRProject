White House adviser Jared Kushner, giving a broad outline of a U.S. peace plan for the Middle East, said it will address final-status issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including establishing borders.
U.S. officials said that Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, is expected to focus on the economic component of the plan during the week-long trip.
But in the interview, Kushner said the proposal also contained a "political plan, which is very detailed" and "really about establishing borders and resolving final-status issues."
Far-right politicians portrayed his comments as a harbinger to a Palestinian state they oppose.
The countries are the focus of U.S. efforts to widen the scope of its peace plan to include an economic element in which Gulf states could help the Palestinian economy.
