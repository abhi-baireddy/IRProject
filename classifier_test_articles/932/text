President Donald Trump’s election and the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union are “one and the same,” his son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote in The Telegraph on Tuesday.

Trump, the executive vice president of his father’s business empire, wrote that British Prime Minister Theresa May "promised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise."

He added that she “ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo."

Trump compares this to the time after his father’s election in 2016, when the incoming administration “mistakenly presumed there would be a peaceful and respectful transition of power from the Democrats to the Republicans, just as there has always been in this country.

"Instead, the Democrats and deep-state operatives in our justice system have been colluding to subvert the will of the American people, with high-level officials even discussing a scheme to try to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment of our constitution.

"In a way, you could say that Brexit and my father’s election are one and the same — the people of both the UK and the US voted to uproot the establishment for the sake of individual freedom and independence, only to see the establishment try to silence their voices and overturn their mandates.”
