Last week, ABC News reported Cain was "expected to withdraw," citing "multiple sources familiar with the matter."
Cain agreed with that assessment, telling the Journal, "What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don't want an out.
"You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter," Cain added.
But I don't think they're getting uncomfortable with it."
Mr. Cain ran for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2012, before dropping out amid sexual assault allegations.
