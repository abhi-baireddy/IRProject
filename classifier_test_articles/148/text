The president has a hard time keeping people in the White House, and why wouldn’t he? He’s under multiple investigations, including probes by the FBI and House Democrats. His television appearances, as well as his relentless tweeting speaks volumes of the mental breakdown headed our way via the president of the United States.

In the three years since Trump took office, probably dozens of people have come and gone after quickly realizing this administration is headed for a major derailment that likely ends with the president in prison.

One more official just resigned suddenly, and Trump is acting like nothing is happening, as per the usual.

Trade Advisor Clete Willems announced Friday that he will be leaving his position in the White House. Willems said this about his work with Trump:

“It has been a great honor to serve the president in this White House for the last two years.”

“President Trump’s leadership on trade has entirely changed the global conversation and will lead to an international system that is more free, fair, and reciprocal.”

Willems, who was top trade advisor for Trump’s negotiations with China, as well as lead negotiator for the Group of Seven and Group of 20 summits alongside Council Director Larry Kudlow. Kudlow had this to say about Willems’ departure:

“As my top international deputy, Clete has helped the president change the global conversation on trade and make exceptional progress in negotiations with China, the EU, Korea, and reform of the international trading system. We will miss him and wish him all the best.”

The president currently has a summit scheduled with Chinese leaders. It was originally set to take place next week, but has now been pushed back to April. This has people wondering why Willems would choose to leave at such a tense time for the president, if they truly are friendly.
