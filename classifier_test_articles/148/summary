The president has a hard time keeping people in the White House, and why wouldn’t he?
He’s under multiple investigations, including probes by the FBI and House Democrats.
One more official just resigned suddenly, and Trump is acting like nothing is happening, as per the usual.
Trade Advisor Clete Willems announced Friday that he will be leaving his position in the White House.
This has people wondering why Willems would choose to leave at such a tense time for the president, if they truly are friendly.
