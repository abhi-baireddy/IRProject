There’s bad and then there’s whatever you call this absolute cratering in the ratings by CNN.
They’ve tried to maintain relevance by continually sniping at Fox News, even promoting boycotts against them, but it hasn’t worked.
CNN had its lowest primetime weekly ratings overall and in the key age demographic last week, according to Nielsen Media Research.
From April 8-12, the network only averaged an audience of 690,000 people and 180,000 in the key 25-54 age demographic.
Averaging only 690,000 viewers overall is absolutely awful.
