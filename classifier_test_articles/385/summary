President Donald Trump last fall floated the idea of ending universal birthright citizenship by way of executive order.
Yet the case for ending birthright citizenship is quite strong, on both legal and economic grounds.
Just a few years after the amendmentâ€™s adoption, the Supreme Court confirmed that birthright citizenship is not universal.
These concerns over who is eligible to birthright citizenship are more than just legal and constitutional.
Ending universal birthright citizenship would help deter illegal immigration and provide substantial relief to American taxpayers.
