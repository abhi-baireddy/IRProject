Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., renewed their request Tuesday for more information about the FBI's probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server, The Hill reports.

The lawmakers, all committee chairmen, initially requested the information in October 2018, but the DOJ at the time said its release could interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"Now that the special counsel's investigation has concluded, we are unaware of any legitimate basis upon which the Department can refuse to answer the Judiciary Committee's inquiries," the senators wrote.

The request is for the classified briefing on the restricted portion of the Inspector General's report on how the DOJ and FBI handled the Clinton investigation along with a response to a classified Oct. 17, 2018 letter sent to the department regarding the Clinton investigation.

The appendix, they said, "raises significant issues associated with the FBI's failure to review certain highly classified information in support of its midyear investigation."

Barr in his nomination hearing committed to responding to oversight requests in general and pledged to cooperate with oversight requests from all senators.
