Republicans in Tennessee are attacking LGBT rights and equality, but members of the clergy are standing up to stop them.
Religious leaders in Tennessee, known as one of the most traditionally conservative states in America, are standing up to a multi-bill Republican assault on equal rights for LGBTQ people.
The religious opposition to the discriminatory bills are notable, especially since Tennessee is historically a Republican stronghold.
Republicans won statewide elections there in 2018, even as Democrats did much better across the rest of the country.
In the deepest of so-called "Red America," members of the clergy are standing side-by-side to fight for what is right.
