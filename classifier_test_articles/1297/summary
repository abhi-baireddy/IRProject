Iconic news anchor and former "Nightline" host Ted Koppel recently fired a shot across the bow at the mainstream media — particularly the New York Times and the Washington Post — saying that President Donald Trump's perception that the "liberal media" is "out to get him" is not without merit.
We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States."
Koppel added that "we have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago.
And he's not mistaken when so many of the liberal media, for example, describe themselves as belonging to "the resistance"?
In October, Koppel told CNN's Brian Stelter that his network's ratings "would be in the toilet without Donald Trump" — after which Stelter became quite annoyed.
