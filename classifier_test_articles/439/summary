A top gun-rights group is challenging the state-ordered shutdown of "non-essential" businesses because of the coronavirus outbreak, and leading Second Amendment advocates say more could be in store.
As fears of the pandemic increase and police in major cities announce they will no longer make arrests over certain crimes, Americans have flooded gun stores and online ammunition dealers in recent weeks.
A shutdown of gun stores would drastically limit their ability to purchase firearms for self-defense.
"Before SAF can sue we need to wait and see how long forced closures of gun stores will last," he said.
The gun industry's trade group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said it is also monitoring the situation and ready to intervene.
