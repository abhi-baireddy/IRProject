Beto O'Rourke seems like he's larger than life, and one guy took that to the next level.
Artist Stan Herd created a crop circle in honor of the former Congressman's campaign, and it really does look like him.
The two-acre homage is located in Texas, where O'Rourke served three terms in the United States House of Representatives.
"Stan was in the field for hours a day," says John Zarr, a project manager who assisted Herd.
The project took about two weeks and cost more than $10,000, but it's worth it to Herd and Zarr, who asks "Why not let your voice be heard?"
