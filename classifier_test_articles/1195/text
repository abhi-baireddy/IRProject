With the announcement of Beto O'Rourke's candidacy for President, many Americans went wild with Betomania. On the day O'Rourke officially put his hat into the ring, his campaign raised a whopping $6.1 million.

Beto O'Rourke seems like he's larger than life, and one guy took that to the next level. Artist Stan Herd created a crop circle in honor of the former Congressman's campaign, and it really does look like him.

The giant image of O'Rourke's face is inside a circle says "Beto 2020."

"We're trying to tell the story of this amazing man from Texas who's making a difference in the national climate," says artist Stan Herd, who created the piece using rock, gravel, mulch, and pecan shells.

The two-acre homage is located in Texas, where O'Rourke served three terms in the United States House of Representatives. Herd's artwork is located about a mile and a half from the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport "so that we kind of guarantee a captured audience coming in."

"Stan was in the field for hours a day," says John Zarr, a project manager who assisted Herd. The project took about two weeks and cost more than $10,000, but it's worth it to Herd and Zarr, who asks "Why not let your voice be heard?"

Make sure your flight goes through Austin: the piece will be visible for about two weeks and can be seen from the sky.
