A Connecticut judge has thrown out a closely watched lawsuit against Remington Outdoor over the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, saying the plaintiffs failed to maneuver around a federal law prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers over crimes committed with their products.
All failed to fit the exceptions Congress wrote into the law, including one for "negligent entrustment," or knowingly transferring a weapon to someone who will use it to commit a crime.
But the judge rejected the plaintiffs' argument that Remington could be said to have entrusted the weapon to someone who used it in a criminal manner.
Cognizant of massacres like Columbine, she wrote, Congress limited negligent entrustment to the direct transfer of a weapon to a shooter.
Therefore none of the people the defendants actually entrusted the gun to “used” it to commit a crime.
