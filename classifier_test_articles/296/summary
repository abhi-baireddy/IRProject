The organizers of the Boston Marathon apologized on Monday for placing the American flag on the ground during an awards ceremony and pledged it would not happen again.
We must respect our flag at ALL times.”Boston WCVB-TV news anchor Doug Meehan was more direct, tweeting, “Hey – whoever is at the Boston marathon finish line – pick the American flag up off the ground!”Seeing this American flag on the ground at the Boston Marathon yesterday is just terrible.
Especially with the tragic history surrounding the Boston Marathon!
Do you think the Boston Athletic Association responded appropriately to their error?
“Our flag is a symbol of freedom, unity, and community spirit — all of which are virtues that the Boston Athletic Association supports.”We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.
