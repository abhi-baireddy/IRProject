Every state carries an electoral vote for each of its House and Senate seats in Congress.
In 2000, the same happened to Al Gore, who sued over a recount of the final electoral votes, which belonged to Florida.
“Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College,” Warren said, which triggered enormous applause at the town hall.
Warren held the event in Mississippi, where she noted that Democratic presidential candidates almost never campaign because the state reliably votes Republican and isn’t a battleground for Electoral College votes.
