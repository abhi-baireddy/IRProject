The fire at Notre-Dame cathedral on Monday prompted immediate pledges of millions of euros to help rebuild it.
On Tuesday, it spurred donations to do the same for much smaller places of worship thousands of miles away that were recently destroyed by arson.
A crowdfunding campaign for three fire-ravaged black churches in Louisiana received more than $1.2 million after it was widely shared on social media on Tuesday.
Many users noted that while hundreds of millions of euros had already been pledged to rebuild the famous cathedral, the small churches in Louisiana were still struggling.
The association noted that donations would go to rebuilding and replacing what was destroyed, from pews to sound systems and musical instruments.
