A television company cited the race of actors in the Broadway hit “Hamilton” as evidence it should not face a lawsuit alleging discrimination against black-owned entertainment companies, according to a petition filed to the US Supreme Court.
Byron Allen, CEO of Entertainment studios, filed a discrimination suit against television company Charter Communications in 2016, claiming it refused to carry channels owned by his company on the basis of his race.
In the petition, the lawyers argue that allowing the suit to move forward would infringe on editorial judgement — and thus violate Charter’s First Amendment rights.
The role of George Washington in “Hamilton,” for example, is exclusively played by a black man, the lawyers argue in the petition.
“A refusal to contract with a white actor to play George Washington cannot be made an antidiscrimination violation without profoundly undermining First Amendment values,” they added.
