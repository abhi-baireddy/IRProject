A television company cited the race of actors in the Broadway hit “Hamilton” as evidence it should not face a lawsuit alleging discrimination against black-owned entertainment companies, according to a petition filed to the US Supreme Court.

Byron Allen, CEO of Entertainment studios, filed a discrimination suit against television company Charter Communications in 2016, claiming it refused to carry channels owned by his company on the basis of his race.

Allen’s $10 billion suit has since survived a motion to dismiss and a review by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Charter’s lawyers have now filed a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court to strike down the suit. In the petition, the lawyers argue that allowing the suit to move forward would infringe on editorial judgement — and thus violate Charter’s First Amendment rights.

The role of George Washington in “Hamilton,” for example, is exclusively played by a black man, the lawyers argue in the petition. If the suit against Charter was allowed to move forward, awful white actors could sue the creators of Hamilton for not casting them in the role.

Allowing the suit “would allow even an objectively terrible white actor to bring an action for being denied a part in Hamilton even if factors other than race would provide an obvious explanation for why the actor would not get a part as a Founding Father in the minority cast,” the lawyers argue in the petition filed on March 8.

“A refusal to contract with a white actor to play George Washington cannot be made an antidiscrimination violation without profoundly undermining First Amendment values,” they added.
