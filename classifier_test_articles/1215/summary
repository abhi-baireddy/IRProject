A group of Republican congressmen visited an Arizona site over 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and lied to their constituents and social media followers that they were witnessing construction of Trump's border wall at the "border."
"Glad to be at the southern border,” Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN) wrote.
They were not witnessing construction of a wall on the border.
Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy noted that they were “surveying border wall construction options,” not witnessing construction of "the wall," as Gaetz falsely claimed.
So pretending he was at the southern border (he wasn’t) to witness the construction of a wall that does not exist is part for the course.
