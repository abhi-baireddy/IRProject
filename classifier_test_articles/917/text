Florida GOP Congressman Matt Gaetz hasn’t been shy about offering up his blind loyalty to Donald Trump in the past. Now on the eve of Michael Cohen publicly testifying to Congress the Republican wrote on Twitter:

Drunk texting? Witness tampering? Or both! — Amy Siskind 🏳️‍🌈 (@Amy_Siskind) February 26, 2019

Hi there. This is witness tampering and Gaetz should be censured. Or arrested. https://t.co/HnrdkEEL8D — Pat Cunnane (@PatCunnane) February 26, 2019

Who wants to tell @mattgaetz that sitting members of Congress aren’t immune from indictment? — Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) February 26, 2019
