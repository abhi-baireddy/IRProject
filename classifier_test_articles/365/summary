Facebook deleted Tommy Robinson's private profile, public page and Instagram account this afternoon.
'Tommy Robinson's Facebook Page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims,' it said.
'We have suspended ads on Tommy Robinson's YouTube channel as it breaches our advertising policies,' a YouTube spokesperson had said.
Mr Robinson also waded into a row following the targeting of a Syrian refugee at a school near Huddersfield.
Following the incident, Mr Robinson took to Facebook to falsely accused the victim of attacking three English girls and a boy.
