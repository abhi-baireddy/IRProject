“This degradation goes against the spirit of the Mission Act to improve the veterans experience and quality of care,” the review said, referring to the 2018 law that authorized the program to expand private care.
VA spokesman Curt Cashour declined to comment on the USDS review, saying it “remains a work in progress.” The USDS didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The USDS report raised concerns that the eligibility tool was designed in a way that wouldn’t work for VA doctors.
The VA blamed its technology infrastructure for delaying the expansion of benefits for family members who take care of injured veterans.
The USDS said the simpler tool could be done in time for the private care program’s launch in June.
