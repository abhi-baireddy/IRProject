Disney's kids' cartoon "DuckTales" has introduced a gay couple — two dads — as the parents of Violet, who's a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, LGBTQ Nation reported.
Their names are Tyrian "Ty" Sabrewing and Indigo "Indy" Sabrewing, LGBTQ Nation said.
We've done pretty well on racial diversity and representation of people with limb differences, but we really have not done enough relevant LGBTQ+ rep. We do have some themes and ideas coming up that address relevant LGBTQ+ narratives.
I'm so glad to be represented by background characters that they can just erase if China so much as raises an eyebrow."
