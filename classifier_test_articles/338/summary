Former coronavirus patients like actor Daniel Dae Kim swear by it, but even after receiving emergency FDA approval, the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine still has an image problem on the left after being touted by President Trump.
The drugs, which are FDA-approved for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, have been used to treat coronavirus patients in Belgium, China and South Korea.

“It was a struggle to breathe and I felt like I was slowly drowning,” tweeted Mr. Santilli.
“Why does CNN not recognize the COVID patients all over the world who have walked out of hospitals testing negative after being treated with hydroxychloroquine?” she tweeted.
