testimony. \n\n\"All the key insiders who have flipped, none of them have spoken under oath in public,\" Melber said. \"This is literally the first time we have heard a Mueller witness under oath speak for an extended period of time addressed by members of both parties.\"\n\nMelber said Cohen has laid out a series of \"damning\" allegations against Trump — \"not all of them crimes, but many extraordinary in their own right.\"\n\n\"This is a Mueller witness, who Mueller said in court they found credible on the key points he testified to, speaking in public and describing a president who basically ran on a lark, used his company for personal enrichment,\" Melber said. ","description":"Ari Melber: \"We just saw something totally extraordinary\""}</script><link
