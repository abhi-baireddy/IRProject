Elizabeth Warren unveiled a childcare proposal earlier this week .
Warren’s plan currently does not offer support to stay-at-home carers, though her 2006 book The Two-Income Trap acknowledges that such support has to be part of a childcare benefit system.
As currently written, Warren’s proposal does not appear to contain any mechanism for controlling the underlying costs of the childcare itself.
The first problem with this argument is that it relies upon the fact that only market labor is counted towards the country’s economic output.
Thus, shifting some childcare from nonmarket labor to market labor mechanically boosts GDP even though it does not, by itself, increase the total amount of childcare being performed and thus does not actually increase total output.
