Denver was downright balmy on Wednesday with a high in the lower 80s — but the temperature had already plummeted into the upper 20s by 1 a.m. as snow began to fall, according to Accuweather.
From 1 to 3 inches of snow is expected to fall in the Mile High City on Thursday.
A similar drastic change happened in Rapid City, South Dakota, which reached a high of 80 degrees Tuesday — but the mercury dipped 40 degrees Wednesday, the weather service reported.
As much as 1 foot of snow could fall in the city, according to predictions.
An “all-out blizzard” is expected to slam the region spanning central and northeastern South Dakota into central and eastern North Dakota, AccuWeather chief broadcast meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.
