Andrew Gillum was caught in a room with more than just drugs.
The man who overdosed on crystal meth in a Florida hotel room with Gillum, a Democrat who made an unsuccessful bid for Florida governor, was an openly gay male escort with a profile on the website RentMen.com, Florida’s Local10 reported Friday.
Dyson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.
Gillum was not arrested but “was unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state,” according to the report.
Dyson collapsed on the bed immediately after opening the door; Gillum was in the bathroom vomiting, the report said.
