Communist China has allowed wild animal markets to offer live bats, raccoons, civets and other species, and a series of studies shows the animals are teeming with viruses that threaten humans.
“The data obtained so far strongly suggest that bats (horseshoe bats in particular) are most likely the reservoir host of SARS-CoV,” the study said.
Scientists believe the virus spread from a wild animal market in Wuhan.
“Eating wild animals has long been a tradition in southern China,” said the study, which relied on student researchers visiting markets posing as consumers.
During Ms. Shi’s years of research, Chinese authorities continued to let animal traders import wild bats into crowded urban areas.
