Over the past year, Fernands, now a sophomore in high school, has connected with other young people around the country and the world who grasp how dire the climate crisis is.
Fernands has been struggling with that sense of helplessness since she first became keyed into the accelerating timetable of climate change in seventh grade.
Cars and trucks account for about a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions, and a significant amount of Fernands’s climate anxiety.
“You are not mature enough to tell it like it is.”She’s not the only one who has found activism to be the cure for climate anxiety.
“The reality is that the climate crisis is really depressing,” said Oli Tierney, a 17-year-old climate activist in Louisville, Kentucky.
