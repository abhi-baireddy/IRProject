The food movement talked about animals for a long time, and now the food movement is talking more about workers, and I think that's a big change.
I'm wondering, do you see there being a coherent food movement in the US?
This is not rhetorical -- is there something I'm not thinking of that you would say is a evidence of a food movement?
I guess the most we can hope is to inspire someone to think that's worth doing.
It's not like I have some secret issue and you don't know to write about it; nothing that would change the conversation.
