The three-judge panel said in a 2-1 opinion that House Democrats were entitled to the material as part of their ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump's conduct.
Grand jury testimony is typically treated as secret, in part to protect the privacy of people who are not charged or are considered peripheral to a criminal investigation.
But several exceptions allow for the material to be turned over, including if it is in connection with a judicial proceeding.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell sided with the House last October in ordering that the material be turned over.
Several dozen witnesses appeared before Mueller's grand jury, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
