The Department of Justice reportedly received an additional 1,303 sex abuse complaints against unaccompanied minors during the same period.
A spokesman for the health department said it takes the claims seriously.
"This works out, on average, to one sexual assault by HHS staff on an unaccompanied minor, per week," Mr Deutch continued.
Mr White clarified that those allegations are not against HHS staff, but rather against the contractors who are paid by HHS to run the underage migrant detention facilities.
"When any allegations of abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect are made, they are taken seriously and ORR acts swiftly to investigate and respond."
