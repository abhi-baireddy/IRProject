In his 2018 confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Mike Lee (Râ€“Utah) whether or not he considered himself to be an originalist.
Unfortunately for them, Kavanaugh just flunked his first big test as an originalist on the Supreme Court.
The Indiana Supreme Court later reversed that judgment.
Did Kavanaugh also explain where he stands on the crucial debate over the original meaning of the 14th Amendment?
If Brett Kavanaugh is a committed originalist, you would never know it based on his complacent behavior in Timbs v. Indiana.
