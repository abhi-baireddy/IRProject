People currently in the Taftan camp told Al Jazeera they were not being adequately screened for coronavirus or treated for existing conditions.
Since last month, more than 4,600 people have been held at the quarantine camp, Shahwani said.
Others at the quarantine camp echoed Ali's concerns.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahwani said the government was doing the best it could with limited resources.
Ali said he feared cases could rise, as those released from the quarantine camp "are not being screened".
