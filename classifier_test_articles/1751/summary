But as Sri Lanka seeks to establish order in the aftermath of the attacks, human rights experts are urging officials to carefully consider how they treat suspects.
The emergency laws enacted Monday will be familiar to many Sri Lankans because the government relied on such powers to crack down on suspected rebels during its decades-long civil war.
In Sri Lanka, a majority-Buddhist country, “there was already a growing sentiment against Muslims,” Ruwanpathirana noted, raising further concern that the nature of the attacks and the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility could fuel existing religious tensions.
And for detainees in Sri Lanka, “torture is rife,” she said.
Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Sri Lanka is still dealing with the aftermath of previous security operations and that the families of people who disappeared in earlier crackdowns are still searching for answers.
