Reddit Email 9K SharesA new study reveals how the human DNA was encoded using an extraterrestrial signal used by ancient aliens who visited Earth in the distant past.
In other words, the human DNA is designed with such a precision that it reveals an “ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of symbolic language”.
So is it possible that we were designed by advanced alien beings with extended knowledge of creating life through DNA manipulation?
If so, is the human species a product originating from another planet in this vast universe?
Or is it rather a product designed on Earth by an advanced race who anchored on this planet in the ancient past, as many timeworn texts suggests?
