Because Cuccinelli's USCIS position was designated initially as "first assistant" to the USCIS director, the Trump administration reasoned that Cuccinelli could become acting chief under a provision of the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.
But Moss wrote that Cuccinelli's appointment did not comply with the FVRA because "he never did and never will serve in a subordinate role — that is, as an 'assistant' — to any other USCIS official."
Rather, Cuccinelli was "assigned the role of principal on day-one," Moss wrote.
The order strikes down directives from Cuccinelli that sped up asylum-seekers' initial screenings limited extensions of those hearings, on the grounds that Cuccinelli lacked authority to issue them.
Today, Cuccinelli's USCIS job title is "senior official performing the duties of the director," according to the agency's website.
