Levin rips ‘white privilege’: ‘This race-baiting, this absolute bigotry, is mainstream within the Democrat Party’

LevinTV host Mark Levin began his radio program Monday evening discussing the Democrat and media campaign to divide Americans through racial politics.

“I keep hearing Democrats, media types, professors, all kinds of weirdos talk about white privilege. I don’t know what white privilege is. I don’t know what that means. You have to work in this country to make something of yourself,” Levin started. “Even if you’re born into a fairly wealthy situation, you gotta work to keep it.”

“The vast majority of the people in this country, whatever their race, have no privilege, except the privilege of being Americans,” he continued. “But now this race-baiting, this absolute bigotry, is mainstream within the Democrat Party.”
