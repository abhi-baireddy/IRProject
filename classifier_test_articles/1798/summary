Did you know that NASA’s space programmers are busy proving that was has been called ‘myth’ in the Bible is true?
The scientists had discovered that somewhere in space in elapsed time a day was missing.
The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua’s day was 23 hours and 20 minutes – not a whole day.
As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible which said the sun went backwards.
Twenty-three hours and twenty minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in 2 Kings accounted for the missing day in the universe!
