Julian Assange is accused of working with Chelsea Manning to crack a Windows password.
Instead, Microsoft makes life harder for cybercriminals and snoops by turning that plain text into scrambled code.
That string of letters and numbers is known as a “hash value,” and it’s created when an algorithm is applied to the plain text of the password.
Back in 2010, it was possible to do that and recover the full hash value.
But as per the investigators’ claims, there was some confusion: Manning said she wasn’t even sure what she handed to Assange was the hash value they wanted.
