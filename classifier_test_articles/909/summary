BOURGES, France â€” In a world seething with anger over the widening gap between the rich and everyone else, France stands out as a country elaborately engineered to protect social peace.
It has less economic inequality than the United States, Canada and Britain, according to the World Bank.
Even so, France is consumed by a ferocious and sustained outpouring of social unrest.
The tumultuous, intermittently violent protests of the so-called Yellow Vest movement have shaken the country since they began in November, intensifying in recent weeks.
President Emmanuel Macron had been preparing to address the nation last Monday to detail new measures in response to the demonstrations.
