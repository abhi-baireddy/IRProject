The White House Correspondents' Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the United States.
"We're going to hold a very positive rally," Trump said, describing the Correspondents' Dinner as "boring and negative."
Trump suggested last year that he might attend this year's White House Correspondents' Dinner if it doesn't include a comedian.
In 2018, Trump threatened to revoke the credentials of White House reporters if they didn't "treat the White House with respect."
"President Trump looks forward to sharing the successes of his administration with the great people of Wisconsin," said Trump campaign CEO Michael Glassner.
