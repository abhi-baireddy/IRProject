Last week, Donald Trump amplified a racist smear against a sitting Democratic lawmaker, potentially endangering her life.
Failing to even mention Omar let alone come to her defense, House majority leader Nancy Pelosi’s initial statement instead accused Trump of misappropriating the memory of 9/11.
And while said backlash may have played a role in inspiring other leading Democrats to speak, many of their initial responses proved little better.
Copying Pelosi’s template, liberal media darling Beto O’Rourke also failed to mention Omar as the target of the president’s attack.
