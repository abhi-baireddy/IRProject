Lawmakers voted down a bill that would have prevented trans students from playing on sports teams designated for their gender identity.
South Dakota lawmakers have defeated a bill that would bar transgender student athletes from playing on the teams matching their gender identity, so now all four anti-transgender bills considered in this session have failed.
A House vote on the measure, House Bill 1225, resulted in a 34-34 tie Monday night, meaning the legislation is dead, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reports.
Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union’s South Dakota affiliate were “thrilled” that the bill failed, policy director Libby Skarin said in an online statement.
The South Dakota High School Activities Association allows trans students to play on the sports teams matching their gender identity if they apply for and receive approval from the association.
