President Trump canceled federal student loan debts Wednesday for tens of thousands of veterans who are 100% disabled, saying it’s the nation who owes them instead for their service.
At the 75th annual American Veterans convention in Louisville, Kentucky, the president signed an executive action directing the Education Department to eliminate “every penny” of student loan debt for about 25,000 disabled veterans, who owe an average of $30,000.
“This is an amazing relief on my family, as well as — I know — many thousands of veterans,” she told the president.
Rather it is America who owes our heroes a supreme debt of gratitude.”Bipartisan legislation was introduced in June in Congress that would dismiss all federal student loan debt for eligible veterans, regardless of whether they applied for related programs at the Education and Veterans Affairs departments.
Mr. Trump also called on the drug manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, to provide the spray to the government free of charge.
