Protesters shouting about "Sodom and Gomorrah" interrupted South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday at an Iowa campaign rally.
The crowd at the Des Moines rally drowned out Terry's shouts by cheering Buttigiegâ€™s name.
CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported that Buttigieg was interrupted three times by protesters affiliated with Terry.
"Remember Sodom and Gomorrah," he yelled over the crowd's chants of "Pete!"
"Coffee after church gets a little rowdy sometimes," Buttigieg quipped after the man was escorted from the room.
