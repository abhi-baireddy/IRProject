For the fourth year in a row, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reported a rise in "hate and domestic extremism."
But prior to then rumors of a run for the White House abounded on social media based on the New York businessman's own social media accounts.
In addition to President Trump, SPLC also cited the rest of the Trump administration, right-wing media outlets and the ease which social media platforms facilitate the spread of hate.
"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates itâ€”with both his rhetoric and his policies.
And unlike other hate groups, which are also on the rise, these groups enjoy political support and influence among local, state and federal governments.
