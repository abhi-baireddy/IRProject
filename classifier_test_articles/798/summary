The Pennsylvania mom and daughter charged with killing five relatives recently ranted that the end of the world was coming this month, a family friend told The Post on Tuesday.
“Tyquilla went there, more concerned for the kids, and they were basically like, ‘Get out of here, you’re a demon.
You’re not wanted here, you’re going to die,’” said Harris, 46.
“I think the whole family was brainwashed by the mother, Shana,” said Harris, who added that she thought the nightmare was a botched murder-suicide.
They have offered wildly divergent and often contradictory accounts of what happened, with Shana at one point telling cops that the victims “wanted to die,” according to court papers.
