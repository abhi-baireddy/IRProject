The words freedom and liberty are iconic in American culture—probably more so than with any other nation because they’re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation’s founding.
It presses us all to bring true freedom and liberty to all Americans.
You’re not free if you’re hungry, so we have food stamps/SNAP (although the GOP wants to gut them).
You’re not free if you’re sick and can’t get medical care, so we have Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare (although the GOP wants to gut them all).
It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words freedom and liberty.
