Pascal Besselink, an employment lawyer in the Netherlands, reckons that about one in ten abrupt sackings there is connected to behaviour on social media.
Today Twitter and other social media broadcast employees’ thoughts; they also make it easy for anyone who is offended to put together a mob and retaliate against the poster and their employer.
Some, like General Motors, have introduced conduct codes which police workers’ speech even when they are not at work.
Though it is not necessarily in companies’ interests to allow the free expression of opinion, it is clearly in society’s interest.
Free speech, including by employees, is a cornerstone of democracy.
