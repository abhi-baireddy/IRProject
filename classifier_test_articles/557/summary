The search warrant, while heavily redacted, offered new details about the federal inquiry of Cohen’s business dealings and the FBI raids of his Manhattan home and office.
It shows the federal inquiry into Michael Cohen had been going on since July 2017 — far longer than had previously been known.
The searches marked the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has threatened Trump’s presidency and netted Cohen a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.
The raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who separately is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Cohen implicated Trump in his guilty plea, saying the president directed him to make the payments during his 2016 campaign.
