Cory Booker, one of her rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, also was not amused.
"We have presidential candidates and congresspeople and senators that now talk about their marijuana use almost as if it's funny," he said.
"But meanwhile, in 2017, we had more arrests for marijuana possession in this country than all the violent crime arrests combined."
But Sanders introduced a legalization bill back in 2015, two years before Booker's Marijuana Justice Act.
He supports legalization even though marijuana is not his "cup of tea," and he has expressed concerns similar to Booker's.
