WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investigators sought warrants to read Michael Cohen’s emails in July 2017, nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, according to documents made public on Tuesday.
Emails were sought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office as well as by the FBI, dating back as far as June 2015, according to the documents.
Mueller is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members.
The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York provide more detailed accounts of Cohen’s financial relationships than previously known.
Much of the discussion about campaign finance issues in the released documents was redacted.
