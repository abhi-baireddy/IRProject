Brett Crozier, the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, sent a letter to the Navy pleading for permission to unload his crew, including scores of sailors sickened with Covid-19, in Guam, where it was docked.
The Pentagon had been dragging its feet, and the situation on the ship was growing dire.
But on Thursday, it relieved Captain Crozier of his command.
Captain Crozier joins a growing list of heroic men and women who have risked their careers over the last few weeks to speak out about life-threatening failures to treat the victims of this terrible pandemic.
Many of them are doctors and nurses, and many of them, like Captain Crozier, have been punished.
