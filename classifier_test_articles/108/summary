The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday requested information following reports that President Trump told acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan that he would grant him a pardon if he broke immigration law by blocking asylum seekers from entering the U.S.
Trump denied the reports on Twitter, saying: "Of course this is not true.
Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day!"
"These allegations, if true, would represent a grave breach of duties of the president.
Congress has an independent constitutional duty to provide oversight of the administration of government by the executive branch."
