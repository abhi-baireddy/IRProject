Traveling with more than one passport in your pocket always comes with a spy thriller novel-like allure. But it’s also confusing. After all, a passport isn’t just a movie ticket that grants you entry; it establishes your ongoing right to visit, live in, or work in a country. A dual or triple citizen needs to make sure their movements don’t peeve the authorities of the countries they visit.

Dominic Volek is a man who knows a lot about passports. He is a managing partner at Henley & Partners, an investment migration firm that advises high-net-worth individuals on the numerous residence and citizenship-by-investment programs around the world. He estimates that up to 80% of the firm’s clientele are seeking a second passport in order to get visa-free access to a broader range of countries. (For example, passports from Cyprus and Malta are particularly appealing, as they provide investors with an alternative citizenship or residency in an EU member state, while Grenada and Moldova allow investors visa-free access to the Schengen area.)

However, he says for all the money and red tape clients wade through, the actual logistics of moving through airports once a client gets their second little blue, red, or green book rarely comes up. “What always surprises me is how few of our clients actually ask the question: How do I use this now that I have it? I would say probably only 10% of our clients actually [ask that].”
