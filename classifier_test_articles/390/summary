The Trump administration is exploring the legality of transporting illegal immigrants who the government canâ€™t detain to sanctuary cities, which by definition welcome illegal immigrants.
Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities.
Transporting illegal immigrants within the interior of the U.S. would not be a new policy, von Spakovsky added.
With regard to local costs that follow relocation, sanctuary cities and counties already are magnets for illegal immigrants.
Sanctuary jurisdictions, generally in heavily Democratic areas, usually encourage illegal immigrants to fill out census forms already, he said.
