But this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions.
Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that’s not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools’ attention.
This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade.
In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed students don’t go to elite schools.
It’s a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.
