Minnesota's freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has become a leading target of right-wing threats, with her office reporting this week that death threats have surged after President Donald Trump posted a video of her.
Trump wrote the words "WE WILL NEVER FORGET" in capital letters alongside a video of the Twin Towers on fire and a clip of Omar speaking at a CAIR event about the attacks on Muslim civil rights in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Earlier in April a man who takes Trump's words seriously and who was arrested for threatening her, told press that he loves Trump and that he, "hates radical Muslims in our government."
Trump made no attempt whatsoever to distance himself from the man.
Instead he has doubled down in a way that many worry is an open call to his supporters to use violence against her.
