Rep. Rashida Tlaib was briefly detained by police Friday during a protest with airline workers at Detroit Metro Airport.
â€œShame on you @Delta for leaving workers behind and letting them live in poverty.
Tlaib herself was not processed as an arrest with the other protesters, according to a protester on hand and was swiftly released.
The squad member was joined at the protest by her House comrade Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) who stopped by offer some extra solidarity, Deadline Detroit reported.
In Aug. 8, 2016, before she was in Congress, a kicking and screaming Tlaib had to be physically removed from a Trump rally in Detroit.
