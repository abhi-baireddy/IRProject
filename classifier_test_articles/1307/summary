Presidents have “regularly told Congress to go to hell” on such matters, as Harry Truman admiringly noted of his predecessor, James Polk.
It sped through Congress—passing even the Republican-controlled the Senate on 13th March and the House on 4th April—because of expedited procedures, never before used, granted by the War Powers Resolution (WPR).
Mr Obama, for instance, deployed the AUMF in defence of his war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria even though the group angrily split from al-Qaeda long ago.
Most presidents after Nixon have simply ignored it, declaring its demands to be an unconstitutional infringement on their executive powers.
Mr Trump has put forward much the same argument for his own entanglement in Yemen (which started under Mr Obama).
