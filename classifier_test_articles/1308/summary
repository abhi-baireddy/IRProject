After nearly dying from infections and losing part of his foot, Mr Feal found out that he was not eligible for financial help for his medical care.
After years of lobbying, in 2010 Congress passed the James Zadroga September 11 Health and Compensation Act to provide free medical care and create both a health registry and a victim compensation fund (VCF).
Some first responders got sick right away, developing “World Trade Centre cough”, a persistent hacking.
His death in 2006 was the first to be attributed to exposure to the dust at Ground Zero.
According to the VCF’s administrator, the fund saw a 235% increase in death claims in 2018 compared with 2015.
