Three of the top media strategists for Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders stepped away from his 2020 campaign on Tuesday, citing creative differences over their vision for his fledgling White House run.
“We are grateful for the opportunity to have worked for Senator Sanders in his historic 2016 campaign for president,” the strategists said in their statement.
According to Federal Election Commission records, the Sanders campaign paid the firm about $5.3 million during the 2016 cycle for its services.
Sanders has already proven to be a fundraising juggernaut in the first week of his presidential run.
Manafort has been convicted of multiple felony counts by Special Counsel Robert Mueller related to his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
