In 2017, prominent Michigan LGBT activist Nikki Joly, a transgender man, was the victim of an apparent hate crime: An unknown arsonist burned down his house, which had two dogs and three cats trapped inside.
Police have long suspected that Joly set the fire himself, though it took a while to collect sufficient evidence.
Joly told an insurance company investigator the arsonist must have been in the home at the same time he was, according to the report.
"I feel as though I was used for a money scam," said Jeff Graves, a drag queen who helped solicit donations for Joly after the house burned down.
The existence of two high-profile hate crime hoaxes—neither of them yet proven in a court of law—should not be used to discredit every alleged hate crime.
