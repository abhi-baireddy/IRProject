We have now reached the point where the president and his openly gay ambassador are being explicitly called racist for acting to prevent lynchings.
And yes, the legal punishment for homosexuality still includes everything up to the death penalty, but things are kinda sorta getting better for gays in Iran, which means progress, which means progressive, which means Iran is pretty much Stonewall 2019, right?
The article also fails to mention that Iran subsidizes and encourages transgenderism for gay men.
Leaving aside the conflation of African-Americans and Persians under the fatuous umbrella of “brown,” the claim that white men should be exclusively or preferentially concerned with saving white gay men over brown gay men has a name: white supremacy.
Yet if these same white men refrained from “trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men,” would that not be homophobic?
