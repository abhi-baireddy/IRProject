The United Nations is calling for a united effort among member countries to tackle the “largest humanitarian crisis” in more than 70 years.
Stephen O’Brien, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said on Friday that more than 20 million people in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, and Nigeria are facing the threat of starvation and famine.
“Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations."
“Collective and coordinated global efforts” are crucial to save those in need, O'Brien said.
It is possible to avert this crisis, to avert these famines, to avert these looming human catastrophes."
