byLike an annoying rash that could become dangerous, the Wall Street and war wing of the Democratic Party is back for yet another reprise in its run in the 2020 presidential primary and election.
Think again… Hillary Clinton has been supplanted by Joe Biden.
Besides the nationalistic chauvinism involved in war, there is the fealty to war industries among Democrats.
It remains to be seen if Democrats, and especially the Wall Street and war fans in the Democratic Party can muster anything like the pushback in Congress to Saudi Arabia’s immoral and illegal war in Yemen.
The Democrats’ record on war predates the attacks of September 2001.
