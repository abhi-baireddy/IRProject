Denver, Colorado (CNN) Pete Buttigieg shared an emotional moment with a young supporter in Denver on Saturday night.
"Thank you for being so brave," the boy, later identified as 9-year-old Zachary Ro, wrote in a question submitted via fishbowl during the presidential hopeful's Saturday rally, "Would you help me tell the world I'm gay, too?
Zachary, who attended the rally with his parents, joined the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor on stage.
You seem pretty strong to me," Buttigieg, who is gay, told Zachary.
Buttigieg took the opportunity to tell Zachary, "a couple things that might be useful."
