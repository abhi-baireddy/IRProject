While Capitol Hill and the media were in the throes of fiery questions and answers between members of the House Oversight Committee and former attorney to President Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, the Democratic National Committee was busy trying to raise campaign donations off the event.
Meanwhile, committee Democrats were claiming the hearing was not about politics but a fact-finding exercise.
“Despite all of the nefariousness circulating the Trump administration and his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump could very well win another four years in the Oval Office.”It then proceeds to ask for a donation to the party.
The hearing itself has been contentious, with Democrats using Cohen to criticize the president’s character and accuse him of everything from colluding with Russia to taking part in extra-marital affairs.
Republicans mostly used their time to expose Cohen as having a history of lying, one of the things he will soon be serving a three-year prison sentence for pleading guilty to.
