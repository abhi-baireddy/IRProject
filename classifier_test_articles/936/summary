Senate Republicans wanted to renew the law as-is, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, insisted that any reauthorization add “boyfriend” language that would strip gun rights from dating partners accused of domestic violence in a relationship.
It led to the creation of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and other programs.
Ms. Ernst and Ms. Feinstein introduced separate versions of the Violence Against Women Act late last year.
That’s really where it impacts us,” said Jane Fredricksen, executive director of the FaithTrust Institute, which works to end sexual and domestic violence.
Groups working against domestic violence have switched to another strategy: lobbying Capitol Hill to boost funding for programs, even if the Violence Against Women Act can’t be renewed.
