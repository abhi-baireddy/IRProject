A federal advisory group is calling for significant changes to how the federal government deals with the surge of migrant families that officials say is overwhelming the southern border.
The bipartisan group also endorsed changes to an agreement that generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days.
The report comes as border officials say they are struggling to cope with an influx of Central American families, with U.S. Border Patrol apprehending a record-setting 53,000 families in March.
"There is a real crisis at our border," say the authors, who include immigration experts, lawyers, former federal officials and a medical doctor.
It is unclear whether the Trump administration will consider any of the changes it is not already pushing Congress to undertake.
