Did you hear about the guy who bought 121 boxes of Girl Scout cookies for $540 so the two little girls selling them wouldn’t have to stand out in the rain? A total hero, right?

LOVE THIS! ❤ The man purchased 7 packs of cookies and gave the Girl Scouts $40, telling them to keep the change. Then he came back to the table and said, "Pack up all of your cookies. I'm taking them all so y'all can get out of this cold." https://t.co/cl7xgHjK2A — Action News on 6abc (@6abc) February 26, 2019
