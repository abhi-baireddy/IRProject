Texas’ winner-take-all system of allocating electoral votes for president is constitutional, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.
Texas has 38 electoral votes, the second most in the nation, and a majority of state voters have backed the Republican nominee in the past 10 elections.
The challenge sought to divide the state’s electoral votes based on the percentage of support presidential candidates receive in the general election.
Smith also rejected arguments that the Texas system dilutes votes and violates the right to cast an effective vote.
"Winner-take-all electoral politics is a rigged system that dilutes the votes of Latinos and other minorities in states like Texas" and the other three states that were sued, Garcia said.
