There are only two possible explanations for why Matt Gaetz posted that tweet about Michael Cohen.
However, right after this news was revealed, Donald Trump made a point of tweeting a glowing endorsement of Matt Gaetz, despite being in the midst of an overseas trip.
Also, is it a coincidence that Matt Gaetz is friends with Roger Stone, who’s been indicted for his role in the theft of those emails?
We’re not the ones who dragged Matt Gaetz’s name into it, of course; Donald Trump did that.
Or did Gaetz just stupidly throw his life away for no reason?
