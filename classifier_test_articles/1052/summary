I wouldn't have gotten through that ordeal without pain medication.
Pain medication helped me get through the worst thing that ever happened to me, and then I walked away from it.
â€” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (@gillibrandny) March 15, 2019So people who are genuinely in pain need to suffer, just because Kirsten Gillibrand wants to be president?
People you'll probably never meet in your entire life, who don't know anything about you, will decide how much pain you get to live with.
Kirsten Gillibrand is never going to be POTUS, and she's never going to be my doctor.
