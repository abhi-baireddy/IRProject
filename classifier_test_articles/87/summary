Think of the suicide bombing orchestrated by the Taliban in March 2016, which killed at least 72 Pakistani Christians as they celebrated Easter.
Just last year on Easter, Islamic terrorists conducted several bombings in Sri Lanka, including at three churches during Mass.
And by rising on Easter morning, He transfigured and redeemed our pain, our misery, our grief.
This Easter, mired in this present suffering, let us remember more than ever our call: to suffer with Him, and so to rise.
