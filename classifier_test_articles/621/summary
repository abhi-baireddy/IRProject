The Florida legislature passed a bill Thursday requiring parental consent for minors to get abortions.
“So, why would we accept that a child can simply inform their parents they intend to have an abortion?”The governor of Florida is expected to sign a bill requiring parental consent for minors to get abortions.
The Florida state House voted 75-43 Thursday to pass the Republican-backed Senate Bill 404, a bill that requires minors to obtain permission from their parents before getting an abortion in the state of Florida.
Unfortunately, SB 404/HB 265 requiring parental consent for minors to receive an abortion passed the Florida House of Representatives yesterday afternoon.
Doctors who perform abortions on minors without consent from the minor’s parent or guardian could face a third-degree felony or up to five years in prison.
