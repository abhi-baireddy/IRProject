Interview by Meagan DayOn the first day of the Oakland teachers’ strike, I met up with Oakland teacher and union activist Tim Marshall at the rally downtown.
Marshall has been an Oakland public school teacher for twenty-two years.
He sits on the organizing committee for the Oakland Education Association (OEA), the teachers union that’s fighting for a living wage, smaller class sizes, more student supports, and an end to school closures.
From our booth, we could hear more than five thousand teachers chanting and singing outside City Hall.
Before the interview began, Marshall got a phone call from a leader at one of his school sites.
