Republican Senator Thom Tillis on Monday evening announced his support for a Democratic resolution to block Donald Trump’s emergency declaration, bringing the president to the threshold of a humiliating defeat.
In a Washington Post op-ed, Tillis said he supports Trump’s border-security agenda, but is concerned about the precedent such an end around would establish.
“As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,” Tillis wrote.
That may be helping to goose Republicans’ concerns about Trump’s so-called “emergency,” but it’s not clear whether it will be enough to turn them against the president’s overreach.
Others told the outlet that they “despise” Trump’s unilateral move as much as Tillis does, but are wary of running afoul of the president.
