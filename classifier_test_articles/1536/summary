to the point that the Saudis were given a free pass on murder by bone saw, there’s one authoritarian who seems to have truly stolen Trump’s heart: Kim Jong Un.
According to new report from CNN, the last time the two leaders met, Trump told Kim that he’d known “plenty of people who’d grown up wealthy and whose families were powerful,” life circumstances that led to them being total f--kups.
But Kim, in Trump’s mind, wasn’t one of them.
Trump, of course, has a vested interest in flattering Kim.
None of which is to say he doesn’t truly believe that Kim is an accomplished dictator people should look up to.
