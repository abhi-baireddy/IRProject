— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 19, 2019ADVERTISEMENTTrump and McCain had a rocky relationship, with Trump criticizing the GOP senator during the 2016 presidential election for getting captured during the Vietnam War.
He's also repeatedly lashed out at McCain for voting against the GOP health care bill in 2017.
But Trump has doubled down on his frustration with McCain this week despite pushback from lawmakers and McCain's family.
“I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be,” Trump told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
“He campaigned on repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years and then he got to a vote and he said ‘thumbs down,’” Trump added.
