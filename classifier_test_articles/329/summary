Now that Sen. Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the Democratic presidential race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party has to unify to beat President Donald Trump.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who endorsed Biden on Monday, will now begin urging his movement to support Biden in a general election against President Donald Trump.
Rather, Sanders must secure commitments that people willing and able to implement the Sanders agenda are installed in high posts in a Biden administration.
As we have argued here previously, the task for both Sanders and Biden is to unite the party and defeat Trump.
The Obama administration is case in point.
