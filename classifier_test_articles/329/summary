Jay Inslee (D-WA), whose presidential campaign has been built on prioritizing climate change above all issues, is calling on the Democratic National Committee to host a presidential candidate debate solely on that one topic.
That petition calls for all 2020 candidates to take part in a debate or forum around environmental issues.
In a statement to The Daily Beast, the committee said petitions for a single-issue debate on climate change would be considered, but it didn’t go beyond that.
“Global climate change is the greatest threat to humanity today, and we need ideas that are big enough and bold enough to address a threat so grave.
“We need these ambitious goals to address climate change just like we needed President John F. Kennedy’s moonshot—not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.
