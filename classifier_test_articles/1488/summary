It has to be a full-blown conversation, with a congressional panel heading it up.
I believe it’s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations.
I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what’s right & begin to heal.
So the timeline is to convene a congressional panel of “experts,” have a full-blown conversation about reparations, and then do what we can to begin to heal.
