WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. Democrats emphasize building their 2020 presidential campaigns on grassroots support, fewer than half amassed at least 50 percent of their early financial backing from small-dollar donations, a Reuters analysis found.
Of the 15 Democrats who launched campaigns before April 1, only six amassed at least half their hauls from small-dollar donations.
Nine Democratic candidates received the bulk of their contributions of $200 or more from their home states, the Reuters analysis found.
Small-dollar donations can help catapult a candidate into the spotlight.
Senator Kamala Harris had the second-largest Democratic fundraising haul, with 37 percent of her $12 million coming from small-dollar donors.
