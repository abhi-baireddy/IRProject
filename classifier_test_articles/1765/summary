Immigrants living in the U.S. with serious criminal records can be held without bail while awaiting deportation even if ICE didn’t immediately pick them up when they were released from prison or jail, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
Circuit Court of Appeals, the liberal panel that covers the country’s West Coast and that has tested a number of legal theories on immigration law.
But if ICE didn’t immediately arrest them, the migrants must be given a chance to make bond.
They said the lower courts shouldn’t have even got involved in the case because Congress has specifically precluded jurisdiction over these kinds of detention decisions.
But since the court was involved, they said they generally agreed with Justice Alito’s conclusions.
