BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Planes, tractors, food and handbags featured on a list of U.S. imports worth $20 billion that the European Union said on Wednesday it could hit with tariffs in a transatlantic aircraft subsidy dispute.
Washington last week issued a seven-page list of EU products to target for tariffs, from large aircraft to dairy products and wine, to counteract $11 billion of harm it says EU subsidies for Airbus have caused.
Brussels has responded with its own list of some $20 billion worth of U.S. imports, also including planes and wine.

The EU responded with duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of U.S. imports.
