Donald Trump’s personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen came across as honest and likable, if flawed in his pubic House hearing testimony.
His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said one lie, and it is go to jail.
Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen’s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man was spying for a foreign government.
The FBI obtained Cohen’s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid.
Cohen has said that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump.
