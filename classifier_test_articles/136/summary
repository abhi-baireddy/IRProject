The liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ruled the Trump administration's decision to withhold Title X funding from medical facilities that provide abortion is constitutional.
The Title X rule was first enacted in 1970, which prohibited taxpayer-funded abortions as "a method of family planning."
During President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1988, "merely provid[ing] counseling or referrals for abortion for family-planning purposes" fell under this limitation.
The regulations were more lax until 2019 when the Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services decided to pull funding from any facility that provides abortions, abortion counseling or abortion referrals.
“Abortion is not ‘family planning’ and a strong majority of Americans – including 42 percent of Independents and more than one third of Democrats – oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.
