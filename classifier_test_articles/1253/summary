The National Christian Foundation has given millions to the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council.
The National Christian Foundation, the eighth-largest public charity in the U.S., has been funneling millions of dollars to anti-LGBTQ hate groups, including the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council.
“Those outfits are at the very heart of the Christian right lobby; they’re well-connected, well-heeled, and effective.”The amount of funding coming through the National Christian Foundation is stunning, Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project, told the site.
“I certainly don’t know of any public disclosures of funds to hate groups at levels anywhere near this,” she said.
The National Christian Foundation, which is the fourth-largest donor-advised fund in the nation, has funneled donors’ money to anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant organizations as well as anti-LGBTQ ones, Sludge reports.
