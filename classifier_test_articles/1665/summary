iStockIf you like to leave things until the last minute, you probably know April 15 as the day to squint at a 1040 tax form or rush through TurboTax.
Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service has shed staff dramatically.
That means fewer bookkeepers to investigate shady claims or to go after people who don’t bother to file taxes.
It’s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don’t pan out to be the straight-forward, belt-tightening measures they’re pitched to be.
But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff.
