ASSOCIATED PRESSA raft of new polls has come out in recent weeks about taxing the rich, keyed to, among other things, Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal and suggestions from other politicians that the top marginal rate be raised on top earners.
The polls can’t tell us what is driving the current push for higher taxes.
So how appealing are a wealth tax or raising marginal rates?
Several new polls suggest that a wealth tax is more popular than raising tax rates.
More Republicans supported than opposed the wealth tax in this poll, but not in other polls.
