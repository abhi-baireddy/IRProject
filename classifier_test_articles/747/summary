A Florida man is dead after a brutal attack by an exotic bird at his Gainesville home.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has the exotic bird listed as Class II wildlife, according to CNN.
“EMS responded to an incident where the caller gave information that an exotic bird had attacked somebody on the property,” Lt. Joshua Crews told local ABC affiliate WCJB.
Law enforcement told CNN and WCJB that Hajos, whose death was an accident, died of his injuries at the hospital.
The fate of the cassowary that attacked Hajos is not yet known.
