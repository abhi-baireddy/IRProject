A federal directive that’s supposed to speed up the response to a pandemic is actually slowing down the government’s rollout of coronavirus tests.
Private labs need only get confirmation for their first five positive and first five negative clinical specimens, according to the FDA’s Feb. 29 guidance.
“In general, CDC testing is a drop in the bucket for the overall testing that happens.”According to the American Enterprise Institute, as of Thursday afternoon, nationwide testing capacity was at about 20,695 people a day.
California public and private labs accounted for 39% of capacity, and the CDC and public health labs together accounted for about 17% of available tests.
