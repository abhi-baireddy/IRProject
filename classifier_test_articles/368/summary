He told the publication he believes that Cohen's marriage is fair game, because it speaks to the 'veracity' of the congressman's testimony.
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told DailyMail.com that Cohen - who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress - appeared credible to lawmakers and apologized to them.
Cohen will also discuss the BuzzFeed report that Trump ordered him to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal.
In his testimony, Cohen also intends to reveal information about Trump's financial statements, an anonymous source told the network.
He said in court that Trump directed him to make the payment, suggesting the president was guilty of a crime.
