Chinese exports, produced for a fraction of the cost of goods produced in other countries, were able to compete on price if not quality.
The United States, as the worldâ€™s largest consuming nation, has been a particularly attractive target for Chinese exports.
But even as Chinese economic officials try to stave off the effects of the U.S. tariffs, exports have swooned.
Chinese exports to the United States were down 14.1 percent in the first two months of 2019 compared with the previous year.
The falloff has dragged down the Chinese economy as a whole.
