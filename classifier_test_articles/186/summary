Freshman Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Tuesday evening said he cannot understand why President Donald Trump would “disparage” the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whom Romney described as “heroic,” “courageous,” “patriotic,” and “honorable.”“I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,” Romney tweeted.
I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God.
“I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,” Trump said.
Trump criticized McCain again over his “thumbs down” vote on repealing Obamacare, saying he was “unhappy” that McCain did not give the White House a heads up about his “no” vote.
“I’m very unhappy that he didn’t repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know,” Trump said.
