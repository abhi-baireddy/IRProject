Two wealthy Ecuadorian brothers who were owners of companies fined and ordered to shut down for illegally trafficking world-wide in aborted baby parts purchased from Planned Parenthood, were arrested by ICE on February 13, 2019.
Ecuador says the Isaias family cost the impoverished country a total of $661.5 million.
The Isaias family began dumping large amounts of campaign contributions into American political campaigns, including $90,000 to Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.
“We hoped that someone would take notice.”Just last month, Operation Rescue published an exposé that delved into the market for aborted baby body parts.
“And we are especially glad that they are out of the baby parts trade permanently.”
