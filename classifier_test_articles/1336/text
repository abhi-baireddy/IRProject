Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to twitter to accuse a journalist of stalking her. Only problem, the person she accused of stalking her was 100% NOT stalking her. In fact he was publicly mocking someone who appeared to be.

The whole shizstorm started when Caleb Hull tweeted out the following pic:

Hi AOC, why is your Chief of Staff eating a hamburger? smh pic.twitter.com/sJanAC1Oz2 — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) February 27, 2019

Hi AOC, why is your Chief of Staff eating a hamburger? smh

TRENDING: THE END OF AN ERA: Drudge Goes Full Leftie - Loses President Trump-- Go to Pro-Trump News Instead

That prompted OANN reporter Jack Posobiec to tweet out the following tongue-in-cheek response:

When you spot @AOC out for dinner and sneak photos of her to post later on twitter 🕵🏻‍♂️🕵🏻‍♂️🕵🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/KvPLxZrFkO — Jack Posobiec, IWO (@JackPosobiec) February 27, 2019

Well, that sent the Democrat over the deep end!

When you’re a guy that’s so unaware of his own creepiness that you tweet this from your own account as if it’s normal and not stalkerish at all 👍🏽 https://t.co/XMMLp550At — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 27, 2019

Um…

How the hell does she have time to respond to silly tweets when we only have 12 years left to live? Attacking Jack Posobiec, a Navy vet, as “creepy” sounds like a personal attack. Are those cool to use again? How can she be so stupid and feed herself?

That’s when AOC’s REAL stalkers went to work on Posobiec:

I hope , and pray, you get arrested. — Cindy Reid (@cindyreidSC) February 27, 2019

I hope , and pray, you get arrested.

Your soon-to-be ex-wife is happy to have time to herself, I'm sure. — josh drimmer🥁 (@JDrimmer5000) February 27, 2019

Your soon-to-be ex-wife is happy to have time to herself, I’m sure.

Yeah, that’s not creepy at all.

Then there’s this one from a writer for Disney and Nickelodeon, so he knows about creepiness:

what a lurker — Hunter Cope (@CopeKills) February 27, 2019

what a lurker

Not everyone lost their minds over Jack’s tweet.

Serious statement: this is why you put the phone down after midnight…you tweet-fight over stupid things because you took someone else’s tweet the wrong way. Literally a gif of a kids movie…..literally. — Graham Allen (@GrahamAllen_1) February 27, 2019

Then Jack went to town on AOC.

A sitting Member of Congress just falsely accused me of stalking her without any evidence What would have happened to me if I hadn’t been able to immediately prove my innocence? We are entering dangerous territory — Jack Posobiec ☘️ (@JackPosobiec) February 27, 2019

And finally, Jack put her to bed with this video. Must see!
