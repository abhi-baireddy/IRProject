He also said Iran may request help from international experts if it is not able to extract the flight recordings.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent <a class="" href="/8f72df659a18d8e3696c84428805675b">mixed signals</a><!-- --> over whether its retaliation is complete. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">If the U.S. or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran, even if unintentionally, it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Soleimani last Friday, with hundreds of thousands joining the general’s funeral processions in several cities, in an unprecedented display of grief and unity.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But sentiments in Iran are still raw over the government’s crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by U.S. sanctions. Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Those fissures could quickly break open again if Iranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of 176 people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens. Iran still points to the <a class="" href="/5c42202308ba8bc3a6ce99cef0d68118">accidental downing of an Iranian passenger jet by U.S. forces in 1988</a><!-- --> — which killed all 290 people aboard — as proof of American hostility.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">U.S., Canadian and British officials said Thursday it is “highly likely” that Iran shot down the Boeing 737, which crashed near Tehran early Wednesday. U.S. officials said the jetliner might have been mistakenly identified as a threat.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost 57 citizens in the downing, said “we have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,” he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The U.S. officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Western countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classified sources.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Videos verified by The Associated Press appear to show the final seconds of the the ill-fated airliner, which had just taken off from Iran early Wednesday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In one video, a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground. The light appears to be the burning plane, which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Someone off-camera says in Farsi: “The plane has caught fire. ... In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. God, please help us. Call the fire department!”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “the missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In a Facebook post, he reiterated his call “on all international partners” — the U.S., Britain and Canada in particular — to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. He also announced plans to discuss the investigation with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later on Friday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Pompeo also called Canadian Foreign Minister François‑Philippe Champagne to offer his condolences for the Canadians who perished in the crash and offered “U.S. support for full cooperation with any investigation,” the State Department said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko tweeted that he and the president met with U.S. Embassy officials Friday and obtained “important data” about the crash.

Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those fissures could quickly break open again if Iranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of 176 people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens.

U.S. officials said the jetliner might have been mistakenly identified as a threat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost 57 citizens in the downing, said “we have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15.

They said the fiery missile strike could well have been a mistake amid rocket launches and high tension throughout the region.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crash came just a few hours \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d40501d9b0a712d02e2a6626f607ead2\">after Iran launched a ballistic attack against Iraqi military bases \u003c/a> housing U.S. troops in its violent confrontation with Washington over the U.S. drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. The airliner could have been mistaken for a threat, said four U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, said in Ottawa: “We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Likewise, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered similar statements. Morrison also said it appeared to be a mistake. “All of the intelligence as presented to us today does not suggest an intentional act,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The assessment that 176 people were killed as collateral damage in the Iranian-U.S. conflict cast a new pall over what had at first appeared to be a relatively calm aftermath following the U.S. military operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was not immediately clear how the U.S. and its allies would react. Despite efforts by Washington and Tehran to step back from the brink of possible war, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/8f72df659a18d8e3696c84428805675b\">the region remained on edge\u003c/a> after the killing of the Iranian general and Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. U.S. troops were on high-alert.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the White House, President Donald Trump suggested he believed Iran was responsible for the shootdown and dismissed Iran's initial claim that it was a mechanical issue with the plane.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.\" Trump said, noting the plane was flying in a “pretty rough neighborhood.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Late Thursday, the U.S. House approved a measure that aims to bar any further military action against Iran without congressional approval. However, the resolution approved by the Democratic-majority House is nonbinding and, at any rate, no similar measure could pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for the airliner shootdown, the U.S. officials wouldn’t say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The New York Times posted a video Thursday it said it had verified showing the moment the apparent missile struck the plane over Iran. The video shows a fast-moving object rising before a fiery explosion. An object, apparently on fire, then continues in a different direction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when the burning plane went down. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines late Tuesday, when it crashed, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Investigators from Iran's Civil Aviation Organization offered no immediate explanation for the disaster, however. Iranian officials initially blamed a technical malfunction for the crash, something backed by Ukrainian officials before they said they wouldn't speculate amid an ongoing investigation. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"6b3b03666ccc4e50aedb011066fc8240\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Before the U.S. assessment, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Hasan Rezaeifa, the head of the of civil aviation accident investigation commission, claiming that \"the topics of rocket, missile or anti-aircraft system is ruled out.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukrainian International Airlines took off at 6:12 a.m. Wednesday, Tehran time, after nearly an hour's delay at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport, the main airport for travelers in Iran. It gained altitude heading west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet, according to both the report and flight-tracking data. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Then something went wrong, though “no radio messages were received from the pilot regarding unusual situations,” the report said. In emergencies, pilots reach out to air-traffic controllers to warn them and to clear the runway for their arrival, though their first priority is to keep the aircraft flying.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eyewitnesses, including the crew of another flight passing above, described seeing the plane engulfed in flames before crashing at 6:18 a.m., the report said. The crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The report also confirmed that both of the “black boxes” that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory was lost.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hours before the plane crash the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued an emergency flight restriction barring U.S. carriers and pilots from flying over areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace warning of the “potential for miscalculation or misidentification” for civilian aircraft due to heightened political and military tensions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, told Ukrainian media that officials had several working theories regarding the crash, including a missile strike.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"A strike by a missile, possibly a Tor missile system, is among the main (theories), as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash,\" Danilov said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian investigators who arrived in Iran on Thursday awaited permission from Iranian authorities to examine the crash site and look for missile fragments, Danilov said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Tor is a Russian-made missile system. Russia delivered 29 Tor-M1s to Iran in 2007, and Iran has displayed the missiles in military parades. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Iran did not immediately respond to the Ukrainian comments. However, Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, the spokesman of the Iranian armed forces, denied a missile hit the airplane in a comments reported Wednesday by the semiofficial Fars news agency. He dismissed the allegation as \"psychological warfare\" by foreign-based Iranian opposition groups.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukraine has a grim history with missile attacks, including in July 2014 when \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/1df62a0bc7048f988f89c47b36548c2b\">one such strike downed a Malaysia Airlines flight \u003c/a> over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. Many of the passengers were believed to be international students attending universities in Canada; they were making their way back to Toronto by way of Kyiv after visiting with family during the winter break.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, \"Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the plane crash. We will surely find out the truth.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crash ranked among the worst losses of life for Canadians in an aviation disaster. The flag over Parliament in Ottawa was lowered to half-staff, and Prime Minister Trudeau vowed to get to the bottom of the disaster.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. accident investigator, the National Transportation Safety Board, is talking to the State Department and the Treasury Department about traveling to Iran to inspect the U.S.-built aircraft and working with Iranian authorities despite U.S. economic sanctions against that country. In a statement Thursday the NTSB said it “continues to monitor the situation surrounding the crash and evaluate its level of participation in the investigation.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. officials have expressed concerned about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Rob Gillies in Toronto, Robert Burns and Matthew Lee in Washington and Jill Lawless in London contributed.\u003c/p>","pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"ML--Iran-Plane Crash","headline":"Iranians shot down airliner, Western leaders declare","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"c7798f9ac6274089a31aef85e13ab07a","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2a2dc1478299d83e233c2cb4d4cd1891","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"2a2dc1478299d83e233c2cb4d4cd1891_25a6aza0c0","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2a2dc1478299d83e233c2cb4d4cd1891","hons":false,"videoContext":"ersonally don't think that's even a question.”\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:2a2dc1478299d83e233c2cb4d4cd1891","revision":null,"mediumIds":["7d38edfc456d4f6a913969519c376a4e","c8142a3f73a7425fb1fb9a11407d2cb0","3774c23efc7e41c18273295acb509552","c7798f9ac6274089a31aef85e13ab07a","1a40095c40dd4cee972ec3afc5462035","56c024cf2bad4e12a34f7362060b5532","299b36be33e846f38c32d5b83d6f6827","309638f734fb4e40bd5561fc727e3ca0","5a8869928c844a52832a065f066cb846","c73c57c316ae4f21a077869a15fe246a","c42b7c58ac594a83a289a9662b65a13a","6b7966ee035e4a2daeabb5361124d9e7","6b3b03666ccc4e50aedb011066fc8240","74ba9a36a6f04d3386383f014089b687","c552732cd51f4d0e973ed950268ddb2f","2c80a5944c98428e90ba66ba4aa58ce1","0b7bcefc1bd84a9f9bc395856bf39ac3"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":"Rescue workers carry the body of a victim in Shahedshahr, southwest of the capital Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi).","imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/7d38edfc456d4f6a913969519c376a4e/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Rescue workers carry the body of a victim of a Ukrainian plane crash in Shahedshahr, southwest of the capital Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2020.
