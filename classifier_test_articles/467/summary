Pentagon Chief Weighs Broader Approach to Border SecurityThe U.S. military is sending an additional 1,000 troops to the border with Mexico, bringing the number of U.S. military personnel there—both active-duty and National Guard—to about 6,000, a senior defense official told reporters at the Pentagon on Feb. 22.
That’s a significant chunk of military resources going toward a mission that can only legally be performed by domestic law enforcement such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers: border security.
Despite their restricted role, it now seems like the troops on the border are there for the long term.
As the Trump administration trumpets the so-called national security crisis of border security—and seeks to divert billions of dollars in military funding to building his long-promised border wall—the Pentagon is reassessing the role of the U.S. military in securing the border.
However, an increased military presence in the border communities does raise concern about the possibility of violent cross-border incidents, he said.
