UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Saturday that denuclearization is off the negotiating table with the United States and lengthy talks with Washington are not needed, the starkest statement yet emphasizing the gulf between the two sides ahead of a year-end deadline set by Pyongyang.
I’d be surprised if North Korea acted hostilely,” Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving for Florida.
Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the United States to change its policy of insisting on Pyongyang’s unilateral denuclearization and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.
Even so, Jenny Town of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea project, said it was unclear how literally Kim Song’s words should be taken.
“It is possible this is what Kim Song means, since we haven’t heard anything quite so stark from those involved in the negotiations.”
