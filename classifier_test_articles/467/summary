Aaron Sandusky has spent nearly seven years in federal prison for conspiracy to distribute cannabis.
Some advocates believe that President Donald Trump is close to granting clemency to some of these men and womenâ€•including Sandusky.
When Sandusky opened a marijuana dispensary in 2009, medical cannabis had been legal for 13 years in California.
The judge prohibited that line of defense, and Sandusky was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison.
