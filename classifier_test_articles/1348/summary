Sam Welch became the eighth judge assigned to the case last Friday and then recused himself this week.
The shooting happened in February 2016, when the officer was 23 and Gunn was 58, in the west Montgomery neighborhood of Mobile Heights.
Legal representation for Gunn at the time disputed the description of the man as suspicious.
Smithâ€™s defense team has tried several times to have the case moved away from Montgomery and has now succeeded.
