The federal debt first topped $23 trillion just five months ago on November 7, 2019.
On that day, the debt rose from $22,985,834,022,811.17 to $23,004,022,933,459.45.
The debt first topped $19 trillion on Jan. 29, 2016, when it rose from $18,989,803,014,663.70 to $19,012,827,698,417.93.
It took the debt 20 months for the debt to rise from $19 trillion to $20 trillion.
“This situation—in which debt grows faster than GDP—means the current federal fiscal path is unsustainable,” GAO concluded.
