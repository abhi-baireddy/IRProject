Who’s Afraid of Saudi Nukes?
One industry executive has called the Saudi foray into nuclear power the “deal of the decade,” and U.S. officials (and Saudi lobbyists) have been pressing the Trump administration to make it easier for U.S. nuclear firms to do business in Saudi Arabia.
For several years, Washington and Saudi Arabia have been negotiating their own 123 accord.
Many experts argue that fears that Saudi Arabia will turn nuclear reactors into breeders for a weapons program are overblown.
Insisting on that right, Saudi Arabia has refused to forswear uranium enrichment as part of any agreement with the United States.
