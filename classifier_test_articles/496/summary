In December 2018, one user described a “Twitter food chain” where information passes from white supremacist podcasts and YouTube shows, to Rep. Steve King and commentator Ann Coulter, to Carlson, to President Trump.
Carlson has amplified white nationalist phrases and talking points to his 2.8 million average viewers – including President Trump, who has echoed them.
“We don’t know if he’s intentionally, self-consciously thinking like a white nationalist and soft-selling it,” he said.
“But I think we can see empirically that…what he’s saying harmonizes with white nationalist views.
Carlson has also been praised on the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer and podcasts like The Daily Shoah.
