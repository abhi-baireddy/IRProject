Why exactly does anyone want Beto O’Rourke to run for president?
Despite taking the odd progressive position here and there, O’Rourke is assiduously vague and slippery on policy specifics.
Despite its considerable length and tone of breathless enthusiasm, we learn very little about what O’Rourke really believes or what, if anything, he would specifically seek to do as president.
‘Man, I’m just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.’ A month later, Beto O’Rourke announces his run for the White House.”To return to the initial question then: why exactly do so many influential liberals believe Beto O’Rourke 2020 is a good idea?
For the majority of Americans, though, the stakes are all too high, and there’s precious little time for another round of fan fiction.
