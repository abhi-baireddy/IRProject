The Trump administration on Friday approved Ohioâ€™s request to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.
Similar work requirements in Arkansas pushed 18,000 people off the Medicaid rolls in six months.
Kentucky, for example, wants to drug-test Medicaid recipients, and Utah wants a partial expansion and a cap on payments.
Legal challenges: Efforts to restrict Medicaid have received legal challenges, and U.S. District Judge James Boasberg blocked work requirements in Kentucky last year.
Even if Boasberg rules against work requirements, expect the White House and Republican governors to continue to push for new limitations on the program.
