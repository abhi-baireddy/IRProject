Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Wednesday that there must be “consequences” for communist China’s alleged silencing of whistleblowers who tried to warn the world about the outbreak of the coronavirus.
“There needs to be accountability.
Look, first we have to defeat this crisis,” Cruz said.
“There needs to be real accountability because the State Department was worried about the threat of a pandemic from these labs before the pandemic occurred and China.
That may be part of the cover-up, they don’t want to answer basic questions.”Cruz added, “I think the United States, I think the world community, needs to insist on accountability and consequences for China’s responsibility here.”WATCH:TRANSCRIPT:
