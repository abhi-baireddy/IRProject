Newly unsealed documents show that agents working for special counsel Robert Mueller began investigating Michael Cohen in the middle of 2017, only two months after Mr. Mueller took on his role and earlier than previously known.
In July 2017, Mr. Mueller’s office obtained a search warrant for the personal email account of President Trump’s former personal lawyer.
The special counsel’s early interest in Mr. Cohen, according to the documents, focused on Mr. Cohen’s consulting work for foreign entities and on his personal finances.
