It took Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) fewer than 40 words on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon to hint at witness tampering — a possible felony.
The Florida Republican and staunch ally of President Donald Trump took an unprompted shot at Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney and fixer.
On Tuesday, he provided closed-door testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee; he will do the same with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.
Legal scholars noted that the content of Gaetz’s tweet could constitute federal witness tampering, a felony punishable with fines and possible jail time.
As of publication, neither Michael Cohen nor his attorneys have responded to Gaetz’s comments.
