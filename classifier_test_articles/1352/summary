For some middle and high schoolers, wearing a Maga hat has become not only a sign of their political allegiance, but an act of rebellion.
Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle.
Maddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example.
She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so sheâ€™s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it.
Before that, a Texas 16-year-old tweeted about having his hat stolen and a drink thrown at him, Trump himself sent over a Maga hat.
