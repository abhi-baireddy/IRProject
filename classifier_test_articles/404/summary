CNN’s Jim Acosta became perturbed on Tuesday after he was not called on during a press conference with President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Acosta complained on air that a reporter from The Daily Caller was called on, that Brazil’s president used the term “fake news,” and that conservatives are pushing back against the bias they face on social media platforms.
“There’s no other way of putting it and trying to emulate him down, as they call him in Brazil, as the Trump of the tropics.
Bolsonaro, who is a right-wing populist, praised Trump after he described past administrations as being “anti-U.S.”“Later on in the news conference, he talked about this conservative grievance that they’re being discriminated against in social media,” Acosta continued.
“They have just as much of a landscape that they dominate as the left does and — and one could argue that they have a much bigger footprint when it comes to social media and the media landscape by and large, Brooke.”WATCH:
