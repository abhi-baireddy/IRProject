Six days after Thanksgiving last year, a 73-year-old woman showed up at Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston.
Hospital staff put in a request to give the woman a blood transfusion, but the order was meant for another patient with a different blood type.
St. Luke’s appeared to miss warning signs in the months prior to the deadly mistake, according to the government report.
A St. Luke’s spokeswoman says the transplant programs still meet national benchmarks and argues against focusing on outcomes from a single calendar year.
Many nurses at St. Luke’s had not been trained on how to identify signs of a blood transfusion gone wrong.
