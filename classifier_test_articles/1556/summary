DENVER — In March, someone spray-painted racist graffiti — including the word "nigger" and crude drawings of lynchings — all over the front of the house of a black family in Denver.
For a week, their house became a weird tourist attraction, with people driving for hours to come take pictures and talk to the family.
Homeowner Ken Jenkins said he initially wanted to hide the graffiti from his two sons, age 3 and 9.
But he decided that seeing hate sprayed all over their family home would be educational — if painful.
“How would your son understand it later, when he deals with it?”VICE News visited the family to ask how that conversation was going.
