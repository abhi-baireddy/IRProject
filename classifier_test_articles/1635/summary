A new poll found that nearly 1 in 4 Americans believe Attorney General William Barr's assertion this month that President Trump's 2016 campaign was spied upon by Obama administration officials.
Roughly 38% of survey participants said they believe Trump and his campaign associates were subject to surveillance by Obama officials.
By contrast, a mere 28% of respondents said they do not believe it, while nearly 35% said they do not know or have any opinion about the subject.
But the question is whether it was predicated â€” adequately predicated," Barr testified.
Barr has set up a team to investigate whether politically motivated surveillance on the Trump campaign took place.
