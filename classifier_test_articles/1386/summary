On its release last week, President Trump’s $4.7 trillion 2020 budget was pronounced dead on arrival, and was quickly lost in the cacophony of his presidency.
It is a budget for a bitter betrayal.
In its first year alone, Trump’s budget would cut funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Science Foundation between 12 and 14 percent each.
The administration also claims it “has pledged to provide paid parental leave” to help working parents,” but there is neither a plan nor an appropriation to pay for it.
Trump’s budget statement repeats his standard pledge that his administration is “absolutely committed to putting the needs of the American worker first.” His budget’s numbers, however, mock his words.
