He could eventually vote for the resolution, but first he’ll apparently have to invest the fifteen seconds it takes to read it.
Since there are already three Republican senators on the record as supporting the resolution, the president can hope to do no better than 50-50 on the roll call.
Trump’s role in the party will be scrubbed even more thoroughly than George W. Bush’s was after he left office.
So, I think it’s not only cowardly of the Republican senators to cower in fear, but actually counterproductive.
One day, they’ll get some mileage if they can say they cast the deciding vote against Trump’s fake border emergency.
