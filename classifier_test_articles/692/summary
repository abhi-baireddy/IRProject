China promised it would not restrict exports of medical supplies hours after the New York Post reported the Trump administration was weighing legal action against Beijing for such actions, reports the South China Morning Post.
China does not and will not restrict the export of medical supplies," Jiang said.
The Trump administration threatened legal action against China after allegations surfaced that Beijing is hoarding medical supplies while the coronavirus crisis rages.
Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis told the Post the White House might push back at China using legal channels.
When you have intentional, cold-blooded premeditated action like you have with China, this would be considered first-degree murder."
