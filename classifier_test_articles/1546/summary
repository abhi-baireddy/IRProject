Scott Lloyd, the Trump appointee once in charge of caring for unaccompanied migrant children, told Congress Tuesday that he never cautioned the Trump administration that separating families at the border could leave children with potentially lifelong damage to their health.
The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Tuesday regarding the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which split thousands of children from their families.
During the hearing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked Lloyd, “Did you ever say to the administration, ‘This is a bad idea.
Did you once say that to anybody above you?”“To answer your question, I did not say those words,” Lloyd told the California Democrat.
At one point, after questioning from Jayapal, Lloyd said, “I never directed anybody to not plan,” Lloyd said.
