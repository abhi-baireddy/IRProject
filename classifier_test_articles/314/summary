byBenjamin Netanyahu is an early version of the nationalist populist leaders that have come to power in country after country in recent decades.
He has an acute sense of who holds – and does not hold – power and how to manipulate it.
The most important election that Netanyahu won was in 1996 against Shimon Peres, after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin the previous year.
On the other hand, the Palestinians will still be there in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank; Israel never achieves a final victory.
Netanyahu has done nothing to change this – but then neither did previous Israeli leaders, whatever they claimed they were doing.
