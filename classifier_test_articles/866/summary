In more recent history, Mr. Conway spent time with Mr. Trump on election night and at the wedding of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in June 2017, when Mr. Trump even commended him on turning down the job because it would have meant reporting to a “weak” leader, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Since Mr. Conway has become more vocal in his criticism of the president, Mr. Trump has referred to him repeatedly as “Mr.
Kellyanne Conway” and claimed that in his diatribes against the president, he is simply trying to gain attention through the reflected glory of his wife.
“There’s some of that.”“He wasn’t my first choice,” Mr. Conway added.
He was the last choice, in terms of the last person standing.” But Mr. Conway said his wife was now all-in for the president, much to his chagrin.
