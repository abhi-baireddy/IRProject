“This state visit will reaffirm the steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” a statement from the White House said.
On the eve of last year’s visit, Trump was quoted in a British tabloid criticizing her approach to Brexit and threatening to upend the U.S.-British trade relationship.
“I think there will be protests,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC on Tuesday.
With help from May and the queen, Trump was able to avoid direct interaction with most of the London protests last year.
If Trump keeps to the traditions of a state visit, he will not be able to avoid encountering London demonstrators.
