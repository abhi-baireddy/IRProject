Called “The Immortus,” the two-person vehicle is the work of EVX Ventures, an electric vehicle technology startup based in Melbourne, Australia.
So light is the car though, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) when empty and 700 kilograms (1,550 pounds) when fully laden, it is able to run on just solar power alone.
The car also doesn’t use normal road tires, but rather tires specially designed for so-called “solar racers” – cars that are powered by the Sun.
Using a combination of battery and solar power, the car will apparently be capable of reaching up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour.
On solar power alone, it can reach up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
