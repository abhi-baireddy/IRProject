S HOULD THE police monitor social media?
Social media, says Joe Giacalone, a retired New York Police Department detective who now teaches at John Jay College, is “a treasure trove for investigators.
If you’re dumb enough to post something on social media and you’re wanted for a crime, you deserve to get caught.” In this sense, social media is no different from any other public space.
On January 17th the ACLU-NC sued seven federal agencies that failed to respond properly to Freedom of Information Act requests about their social-media surveillance.
As people live more of their lives online, surveillance will inevitably follow.
