The world was watching President Donald Trump as he arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam for his summit with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un.
The US President tweeted a shout-out to his "friend", Kim Jong Un, talking about the "awesome" opportunity for North Korea if they denuclearize.
Not everyone was as psyched about the president getting cozy with Kim Jong Un for that very reason, so they took to Twitter to remind him..Kim Jong Un and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship, with Trump calling Kim Jong Un a "madman" and Kim Jong Un referring to Trump as "mentally deranged U.S.
That alliance, however, may not be the best news for the country Donald Trump has been tasked with representing.
While denuclearization is a truly noble goal, Trump calling Kim Jong Un "friend" really is in bad taste.
