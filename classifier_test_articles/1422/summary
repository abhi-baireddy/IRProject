On Monday afternoon Bernie Sanders showed us how he could win the Democratic nomination.
Perhaps most important of all, he insisted that Democrats must do more than simply run against President Trump in 2020.
The Democratic National Committee's announcement in March that Fox News would not be allowed to host any debates with its candidates was cowardly.
This is the key to his appeal and the path he will try to take toward the nomination in 2020.
But all Sanders needs is what Trump had last time, which is to say, a plurality of 25 or 30 percent.
