Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project, which he says Trump knew about as Cohen was negotiating with Russia during the election.
Cohen says that he and Trump once drove through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago and that Trump remarked that only black people could live that way.
He met with the Senate intelligence committee for more than nine hours behind closed doors on Tuesday.
After the public hearing Wednesday, he will appear before the House intelligence panel Thursday, again speaking in private.
Cohen is not expected to discuss matters related to Russia in the public hearing, saving that information for the closed-door interviews with the intelligence committees.
