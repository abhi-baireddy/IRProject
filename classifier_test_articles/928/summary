Trump and Kim, who arrived in Vietnam Tuesday, will have a series of official meetings Thursday.
"If I were not elected president, you would have been in a war with North Korea," Trump said last week.
The North Koreans have largely eschewed staff-level talks, pushing for discussions between Trump and Kim.
After the last summit, Trump unilaterally suspended some military drills with South Korea, alarming some in Seoul and at the Pentagon.
But he was insistent this week that he would not draw down U.S. troops from South Korea.
