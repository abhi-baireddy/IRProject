Another day, another paparazzi-pandering press launch for his new endeavor: the Brexit Party, its logo a blue arrow, vaguely reminiscent of Hillary Clinton’s from 2016.
The handful of MPs who voted Leave are, by and large, right-wing headbangers and extremists, marking Brexit, as it stands, as a project of the far right.
That is no more obvious than when examining the language employed by UKIP, Farage, and his new Brexit Party.
Farage’s Brexit Party was recently forced to suspend two founding members for sharing racist and inflammatory tweets.
But the platform this gives the far right should concern everyone on the Left.
