Meanwhile, Cohen has also claimed publicly that Trump’s business organization privately negotiated over a Trump Tower in Moscow far longer than previously known — deep into the GOP presidential primaries.

We already know Trump helped Donald Trump Jr. lie to the American people about this meeting, too.
No amount of fake claims of vindication from a cramped Mueller disclosure can make all of that disappear.
