GOP senators voted to let Trump rob millions of dollars from military families in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina.
When it comes to choosing between military families in their own state or pledging their loyalty to Trump, many vulnerable Republican senators chose Trump.
Each of those states has a Republican senator running for re-election in 2020, and yet they still voted to let Trump rob military families in their own backyard.
In doing so, he planned to steal money from military projects, defying the will of Congress and possibly the Constitution.
The Trump administration has not made a final decision on which military projects will be robbed.
