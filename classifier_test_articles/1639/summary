A federal judge denied a request to block President Trump's unilateral ban on bump-fire stocks pending further litigation on Monday night.
The judge argued that the statutory definition of "machinegun" is vague and the ATF is therefore free to reinterpret it in the way they did.
She went on to argue a bump stock automates specific functions that would otherwise need to be done manually when bump firing.
"The bump stock makes it easier to bump fire because it controls the distance the firearm recoils and ensures that the firearm moves linearly—two tasks the shooter would ordinarily have to perform manually," she wrote.
"In this way, a bump stock creates a ‘self-acting mechanism' that permits ‘the discharge of multiple rounds' with ‘a single function of the trigger … without manual reloading.'"
