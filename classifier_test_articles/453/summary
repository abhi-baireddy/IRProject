KUSA/9News.comYesterday, February 24th, the disability rights advocate community lost one of its mightiest members, Carrie Ann Lucas.
Lucas was a nationally known disability rights attorney and a mother of four children, each of whom are adopted and living with disabilities.
According to the Facebook post, Lucas’ death was ultimately a result of her insurance company, UnitedHealthCare, refusing to pay for one specific inhaled antibiotic.
She founded Disabled Parents Rights, a nonprofit that’s “dedicated to combating discrimination that impacts parenting for parents with disabilities.
Carrie Ann Lucas is survived by her children, parents and siblings, as well as her partner Dr. Kimberly Jackson, who is also a disability rights advocate.
