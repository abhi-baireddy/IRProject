Now Title III of the U.S. 1996 Helms Burton Act joins an arsenal of weapons employed in what Cubans regard as genocidal aggression.
Helms Burton is complex but centers on tightening the economic blockade; preparing for a transition government; and by means of Title III, inflicting suffering and destabilization.
In 1966, when the law was introduced, the European Union and other critics insisted that the U.S. government delay implementation of Title III.
A few business-oriented U.S. groups oppose Title III out of concern that future U.S. commercial ventures in Cuba would be vulnerable.
Title III contains the seeds for havoc in the event that Cubaâ€™s government is no more and the United States takes charge.
