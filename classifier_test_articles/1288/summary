Attorneys for a female Pennsylvania high school student filed a federal complaint last week alleging her privacy was violated and that she was subjected to sexual harassment when a transgender student was using the same locker room, WNEP-TV reported.
She added: "When I knew that a man was looking at me, I felt very violated and very scared â€” especially looking at me while I'm getting dressed."
Attorney Andrea Shaw added in the video that "opening up restrooms and locker rooms to members of the opposite sex is sexual harassment.
WNEP said few people would speak on camera about their reaction to the complaint but indicated off camera they support the female student and her family.
"The student called the trans student a 'man.'
