Widodo is on track to win a second term, preliminary election results showed Wednesday, in apparent victory for moderation over the ultra-nationalistic rhetoric of his rival Prabowo Subianto.
With an average of 80% of sample polling stations counted, the five survey organizations showed Widodo winning 54-56% of the vote, a modest improvement on his 2014 showing.
A second term for Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the Jakarta elite, could further cement the countryâ€™s two decades of democratization.
