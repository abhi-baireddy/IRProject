Michelle R. MartinelliFor The WinHouston Astros pitcher Collin McHugh earned the win Tuesday night against the Oakland A's, but his real winning moment was not throwing the ball, but instead avoiding the line drive that shot back at him and threatened to destroy his face.
Luckily, McHugh appears to have exceptional reflexes.
Rather than getting drilled in the head, McHugh smoothly bent backward and avoided any real contact as the ball slid right under his chin.
Amazingly, it only grazed McHugh's finger, per MLB.com, and Astos shortstop Carlos Correa fielded the ball and turned a double play.
McHugh said he's seen "The Matrix" before, but that's not where his crazy reflexes came from.
