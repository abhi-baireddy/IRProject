Midway through Thursday’s rally, the president reacted to protesters interrupting his speech by pointing to one and shouting, “That guy has got a serious weight problem.
Go home, get some exercise!”As it turns out, the man he mocked is actually a rabid Trump supporter.
Speaking to Fox News’ Griff Jenkins after the rally, Frank Dawson explained that the president was definitely speaking about him during that moment.
“He was because he didn’t see me rip the signs away from those three people sitting near us,” Dawson told Jenkins.
I was the good part of it.”After Jenkins noted that the president ridiculed Dawson's weight, the Trump fan brushed it off while heaping praise on Trump.
