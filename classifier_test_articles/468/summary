How John Bolton Won the Beltway Battle Over SyriaJohn Bolton, the U.S. national security advisor and longtime Iran hawk, has won a crucial victory with the partial reversal of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria.
The U.S. troops that remain in the country will be focused on “stabilization and enhancing the “security capability of local security forces,” he noted.
But as the Islamic State has steadily crumbled, Tanf has become a crucial buttress against Iranian influence.
But a continued U.S. presence at Tanf, which is far from the fight against the Islamic State in northeastern Syria, poses major risks.
Furthermore, leaving small forces in both Syria and Iraq to “watch Iran” rather than fight the Islamic State raises legal questions.
