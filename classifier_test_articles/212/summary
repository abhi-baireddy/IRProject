A 40-year-old Mexican immigrant died in US custody on Monday — the fourth person to die after being apprehended by border authorities in recent months.
In December, two Guatemalan children, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal and 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo, also died in the custody of CBP.
The Mexican national who died this week had been apprehended by Border Patrol agents early Sunday near the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso.
The man had been previously deported and arrested by Border Patrol for illegal reentry.
The Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and the Mexican government have been notified.
