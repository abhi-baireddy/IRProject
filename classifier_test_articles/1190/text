President Donald Trump's attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has widely established a perception of ineptitude after months of contradictory explanations for Trump's actions and a series of verbal gaffes that have since been immortalized.

So it's fair to say he lived up to expectations when responding to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's leaked opening statement ahead of Cohen's testimony to the House Oversight Committee Thursday morning.

In the statement, Cohen calls Trump a racist, a conman, and a cheat. What's more, he presents documents which supposedly prove the allegation.

As usual, Giuliani attempted to defend the President, unequivocally denying Cohen's allegations and dismissing his credibility.

Also as usual, Giuliani succeeded in making things worse for the President.

Giuliani said:

"It's pathetic...If you believe him, you are a fool. He bragged he was connected to Russian organized crime and he may be."

Giuliani cited Cohen's alleged ties to Russian organized crime while attempting to discredit his testimony against a President who's fended off allegations of entanglement with Putin for the better part of the last two years.

Classic.

Many noticed that Giuliani's statement made Trump look bad on the Russia front.

They gave Rudy and Trump a challenge.

Many demanded that Trump and Giuliani follow Cohen's lead and testify under oath.

Some also warn that Giuliani will face the same fate as Cohen, with perhaps even less mercy.

Cohen's testimony is seven hours away at the time of this article's writing. It's already making waves.
