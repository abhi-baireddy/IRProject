California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D) on Tuesday shared a fiery rebuke of the Trump administration that he sent to Vice President Pence.
Rendon was responding to a letter from the vice president wishing California a “successful legislative session” and touting the administration’s embrace of federalism.
