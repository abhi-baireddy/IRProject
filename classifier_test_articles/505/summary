The number of Southern California Edison customers whose power was turned off to try to prevent wildfires was going down steadily Thursday, but about 41,000 were still without electricity by evening.
Those winds were expected to gradually die down throughout the day Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
Here are the areas in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties where Edison said it has cut electricity or was considering it as of 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
An Edison spokesman said there is on average one meter for every three people in its service area.
