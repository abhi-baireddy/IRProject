Feminist icon Gloria Steinem likened anti-abortion conservatives to former German dictator Adolf Hitler during an interview on NBC's "Today" show.
First Steinem mentioned a "parody" titled, "If Men Could Menstruate," which got some laughs from the rapt co-hosts.
was originally published in the October-November 1980 issue of Ms. magazine, which Steinem co-founded, and it became a chapter in Steinem's book.
In that chapter Steinem decries anti-abortion efforts of political and religious conservatives on the eve of what would be President Ronald Reagan's election and draws parallels to Hitler's dictatorial reign.
Interestingly Steinem begins the chapter with quotes from conservatives comparing the genocide of abortion to Hitler's genocide of 6 million Jews in World War II â€” and apparently Steinem still sees a Hitler connection, just in an opposing direction.
