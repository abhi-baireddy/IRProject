President Trump landed just outside Seoul for a meeting with South Korea’s leader — and a possible “quick hello” with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

But if the proposed handshake at the demilitarized zone doesn’t happen, Trump said Saturday he’s OK with that.

“Of course, I thought of that,” Trump said of the prospect of not meeting Kim, according to CNN.

He reportedly called the situation between the US and North Korea “very hard.” Trump also said Kim follows him on Twitter, pointing to a call Trump’s team got “very quickly” after the US president tweeted about the proposed meeting on Friday.

Trump said on Saturday that the White House was hammering out details with Pyongyang.

The trip follows a whirlwind series of meetings Trump held with world leaders at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan.

On Friday, he said he would be interested in meeting Kim at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.

“After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” Trump tweeted Friday night.
