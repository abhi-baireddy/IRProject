The coronavirus pandemic will plunge the global economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund predicted Tuesday.
The fund expects the world economy to contract by 3 percent in 2020 as measures meant to stop the virus freeze economic activity around the world.
That’s a much steeper drop than 2009, when the economy shrank 0.7 percent amid the global financial crisis.
“The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically,” IMF economic counsellor Gita Gopinath said in the fund’s 2020 World Economic Outlook.
But there is “extreme uncertainty” about the forecast because the path of the virus crisis and its economic effects are tough to predict, according to IMF officials.
