The Republican chairmen of three Senate committees are pressing Attorney General William Barr for details about “highly classified information” that the FBI declined to investigate as part of the Hillary Clinton email probe.
The FBI drafted a memo in May 2016 saying that the information was “necessary” to complete the investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified information on her private email server, according to the Republicans.
But as the Justice Department inspector general found in a report released last year, the FBI declined to take up the matter before closing the Clinton investigation in July 2016.
The inspector general’s finding “raises significant issues associated with the FBI’s failure to review certain highly classified information in support of its Midyear investigation,” reads the letter to Barr, signed by GOP Sens.
