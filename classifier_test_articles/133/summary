In the fight between the governors and President Trump over who has the authority to reopen America, the politicians have it wrong.
It's not the politicians who have the power to reopen America, or at least the parts that are now closed.
The politicians can help by eventually lifting lockdown orders and school closures.
But when America reopens, it won't be the response to top-down orders from politicians.
The best plan for reopening America is one that sticks to American valuesâ€”one that emphasizes freedom, competition, choice, and diversity, not one-size-fits-all compulsion or command-and-control authoritarianism.
