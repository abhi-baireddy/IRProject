President Trump has no regrets about tweeting a 9/11 video that Rep. Ilhan Omar says caused a spike in threats against her life.
“She’s been very disrespectful to this country,” Trump said of Omar.
I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.”Separately, Trump spoke at a Tax Day event in Minnesota and took what some perceived to be a veiled shot at Somali immigrants, including Omar, in the state.
“President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.”Pelosi herself has been subject to criticism over her handling of Trump’s 9/11 video.
On Tuesday, Pelosi deflected a question from CNN’s Christiane Amanpour about whether she responded quickly enough to defend Omar.
