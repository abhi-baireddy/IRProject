Contrary as their movements may seem, white supremacists and jihadists both leech off different ends of a tragedy like Christchurch as seen in the barrages of propaganda from both movements on social media.
White supremacists celebrated the Christchurch attack across various venues, from community-specific forums like Stormfront and Vanguard News Network (VNN) to alternative, free-speech-purposed social media platforms like Gab and Minds.
”But while white supremacists celebrate, Tarrant has done a major favor for ISIS and al Qaeda recruitment efforts.
They’re repeating that mistake now with white supremacists.
And when comparing the way jihadist online spaces are handled compared to white supremacists, it’s not even close; hiding behind images of their countries’ flags and pseudo-patriotic slogans, white supremacists are too often left unchecked.
