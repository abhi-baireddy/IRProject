CNN admitted fault on Wednesday after being accused of failing to disclose Democratic Party ties of several attendees who were able to ask 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders questions during the network’s town hall on Monday.
The CNN event followed other recent town halls featuring Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; and potential independent candidate, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
But unlike those town halls, many participants who posed policy questions to Sanders appear to have political ties, which was first reported by Paste Magazine.
“As we saw in the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Party has become more female, more racially diverse, and younger in age.
But Uygur said there is an “unfortunate history” of CNN being unfair to “one particular candidate,” which he said is Sanders.
