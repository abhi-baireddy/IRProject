Indeed, Sanders is officially in the top 1 percent of income, and this has some wondering if it somehow jams up his political narrative.
The obvious truth as to why Sanders is rich is that he is very famous, and it is extremely easy to capitalize on fame.
But nobody cared about the much larger $65 million book advance Obama got, because there isn't some Big Reader lobby that is pushing for book subsidies or something.
So one might fault Sanders for not donating that much to charity â€” though that is no substitute for a proper welfare state.
But there is no reason to question his (or Elizabeth Warren's, for that matter) egalitarian political commitments.
