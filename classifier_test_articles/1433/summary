A week after Election Day, I threw up in the toilet.
When I was pregnant with my first baby, the future seemed big and bright.
After I found out I was pregnant, anxiety quickly dampened my excitement as I fretted about the future.
On Inauguration Day, I was three months pregnant.
Every day, I watch my baby grow more independent, more fully integrated, more alive in this complicated world.
