A New Jersey National Guard member is the first U.S. service member to die from COVID-19, Fox 29 in Philadelphia reports.

Capt. Douglas Linn Hickok, a resident of Pennsylvania, died Saturday at a hospital in his home state, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.

"Our thoughts are with his wife, children and their family," Murphy said.

The Pentagon said Hickok is the first member of the U.S. military to die from coronavirus..

"This is a stinging loss for our military community, and our condolences go out to his family, friends, civilian co-workers and the entire National Guard community," Defense Secretary Mark Esper said. "The news of this loss strengthens our resolve to work ever more closely with our interagency partners to stop the spread of COVID-19."

Hickok's death was not part of New Jersey's official coronavirus count because he was a Pennsylvania resident and died in that state, Murphy said.
