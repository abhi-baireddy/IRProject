Cohen To Detail Alleged Trump Lawbreaking.
White House: He's A 'Convicted Liar'Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/APMichael Cohen intends to give Congress an account of what he calls President Trump's "lies, racism and cheating" â€” including lawbreaking since Trump took office, a person familiar with his plans said on Tuesday.
But Cohen is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the House oversight committee in a highly anticipated public hearing that will be broadcast live nationally.
The White House issued a statement on Tuesday dismissing Cohen's allegations before he even made them.
Trump has said he decided on his own not to pursue the Trump Tower Moscow project and, indeed, the building was never built.
