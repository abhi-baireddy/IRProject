House Democrats need not ask meekly for information about Trump’s finances and the Mueller report and accept whatever Trump voluntarily provides.
Trump and his political allies argue that Congress has no power to prosecute crimes, and matters under criminal investigation are none of House Democrats’ business.
House Democrats have other obviously proper reasons to investigate Trump’s financial interests and the Mueller Report, however.
House Democrats need not have particular legislation in mind to investigate Trump’s finances or the Mueller Report.
Trump argues that any supposed legislative purpose is a “pretext,” and House Democrats just want to inflict political damage.
