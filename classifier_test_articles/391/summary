A Mexican national was sentenced to one month in prison for illegally voting in the 2016 presidential election, a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina announced Monday.
Guadalupe Espinosa-Pena, 61, pleaded guilty to illegally voting in the 2016 general election in North Carolina.
President Donald Trump won North Carolinaâ€™s 15 electoral votes in the general election, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by only 3.6%, or fewer than 200,000 votes.
However, Clinton won Wake County by one of the largest margins in the state of North Carolina.
It is not clear which candidate Espinosa-Pena voted for during the 2016 election.
