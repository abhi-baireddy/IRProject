The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is issuing a new proposed rule that refines the definition of the waters of the United States (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.
The Clean Water Act instructs the EPA to "prepare or develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters."
Trump's executive order held enforcement of the WOTUS rules in abeyance until the EPA could issue new rules.
In August 2018, a U.S. district court judge issued an injunction against the Trump administration's delay in implementing the Obama era WOTUS rules.
Nearly 50 years after the Clean Water Act was passed, about 53 percent of assessed rivers and streams are impaired as are 71 percent of the assessed acres of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.
