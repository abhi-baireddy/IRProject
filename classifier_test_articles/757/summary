California Jury Finds Roundup Caused Man's CancerEnlarge this image toggle caption Haven Daley/AP Haven Daley/APA San Francisco federal jury unanimously agreed on Tuesday that Roundup caused a man's cancer â€” a potentially massive blow to the company that produces the glyphosate-based herbicide currently facing hundreds of similar lawsuits.
After five days of deliberation the jury concluded the weed killer was a "substantial factor" in causing non-Hodgkins lymphoma in Edwin Hardeman, a 70-year-old Sonoma County man.
In August, another San Francisco jury determined Roundup had caused cancer in a former groundskeeper.
"We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer," Bayer added.
More than 750 cases Roundup cases against Bayer have been consolidated in San Francisco's federal court.
