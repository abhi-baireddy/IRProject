The cost of two new Air Force One planes is $1.4 billion more than the White House initially said.

Trump has long touted his ability to lower the cost of two new Air Force One planes, puffing his chest and bragging that he got the cost of the new jets down to $3.9 billion.

However, Government Executive reports that the actual price tag for the Air Force One project is $5.3 billion, according to the fiscal year 2020 budget proposal the Pentagon submitted this week.

That's far, far higher than the $3.9 billion price Trump claimed to negotiate for the planes, and is actually higher than the initial $5 billion estimate the White House said the project would cost before Trump helped "negotiate" the price down.

Back in February 2017, when Trump first announced the deal, he bragged about his negotiating skills and how they helped save taxpayers money on the new Air Force One planes.

"I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion plane," Trump said at a campaign rally in Florida at the time. "We've got that price down by over $1 billion and I probably haven't spoken for more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic â€¦ but I told Boeing that isn't good enough, the price is still too high."

Yet that was not true, as the Pentagon is now saying the project will actually cost $5.3 billion.

The $5.3 billion estimate is the first time the Pentagon released the total cost for the project, which also includes building new hangars and other "administrative, engineering, and development work," according to Government Executive.

So, it seems the White House was not telling the whole truth about the cost of the Air Force One project.

But we guess that's to be expected from an administration led by a serial liar.
