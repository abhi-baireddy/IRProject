There’s One Far-Right Movement That Hates the KremlinKIEV, Ukraine—If you’ve ever been to Paris, you’ve probably snapped a photo of the very spot that’s a symbol for a far-right movement more than 1,000 miles away.
The far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces.
Nostalgia for the lost Algerian cause—the failed effort to keep Algeria a part of France—became a core cause of the French far-right.
The Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control.
Ukrainians support their initiatives without knowing they’re linked to the Azov movement, she said, and are happy to support the movement when its sponsorship or involvement is revealed.
