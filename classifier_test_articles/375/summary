Katie Price's boyfriend Kris Boyson has denied threatening a police officer after she was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.
Boyson, 30, is in an on-off relationship with the model and reality star, 40, and last night the pair arrived home from a holiday in Thailand together.
He appeared at Medway Magistrates Court this morning where he pleaded not guilty to using threatening or abusive language and behaviour against a police officer.
The alleged victim of the incident near Boyson's home in Gravesend, Kent, is an officer called PC Blundell, according to court records.
It happened after Boyson got into an argument with a photographer, the court heard.
