Princeton University economist Alan Krueger, who served as a top economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, committed suicide Saturday, according to his family.
"The family requests the time and space to grieve and remember him.
Krueger was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama from 2011 to 2013, and was an economist at the U.S. Labor Department under Clinton.
In a statement, Obama called Krueger "a fundamentally good and decent man."
"He saw economic policy not as a matter of abstract theories, but as a way to make people's lives better."
