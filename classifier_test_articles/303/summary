President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at the White House, March 29, 2020.
(Al Drago/Reuters)The Trump administration’s guidelines for reopening the U.S. economy will give recommendations to state governments on when to relax business closures, effectively recognizing that the final decision rests with individual governors.
“The buck stops with the governors,” a senior administration official involved in development of the guidelines told the Wall Street Journal.
During a conference call with several state governors on Thursday, Trump also emphasized that governors will have the authority to reopen local businesses when they see fit.
“The Constitution and common sense dictates these decisions be made at the state level,” Rubio wrote on Twitter.
