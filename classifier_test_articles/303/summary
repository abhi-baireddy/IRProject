The heavily blacked-out records, released by a judge at the request of news organizations, show that Mueller was investigating Cohen by July 2017 — much earlier than previously known.
That was two months after Mueller was appointed to investigate Moscow’s election interference and practically a year before an FBI raid on Cohen’s home and office.
The full scope of Mueller’s interest in Cohen is not clear from the documents, which include search warrant applications and other records.
By February 2018, though, the records show Mueller had handed off portions of his investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
But prosecutors have said Trump himself directed Cohen to arrange the hush money.
