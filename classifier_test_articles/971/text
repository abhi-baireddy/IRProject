Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) told CNN’s Chris Cuomo this morning that what the Donald Trump administration likes to call “sanctuary cities” should really be called “Fourth Amendment cities.”

President Trump and his Attorney General Jeff Sessions identify cities that refuse to spend municipal funds on helping federal immigration enforcement as safe havens for undocumented immigrants. Gutiérrez, who represents the outer edges of Chicago, argues that Chicago’s decision to to be a sanctuary city means that Chicago is willing to uphold the rights ensured by the Bill of Rights.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officials have been detaining individuals they suspect are undocumented without demonstrating to a judge that they have probable cause and obtaining a warrant.

“Here’s how I see it — yeah, they call them sanctuary cities. What I would say, Chris, is they’re Fourth Amendment cities. The DEA, the FBI, the ATF — they get warrants right? They go and pick people up. “What ICE — which is another federal law enforcement agency — does is it wants to have people detained and wants the city of Chicago to go after people without any probable cause being submitted before the court and without a warrant. “If you supply a warrant to the city of Chicago, we will absolutely honor that warrant. But you’ve got to get a warrant.”

Gutiérrez makes a compelling case for why sanctuary cities are actually upholders of American values enshrined in the Constitution.

The Trump administration is trying to strong arm sanctuary cities into giving up their cause by cutting their federal block grants. They should try taking a look at the Bill of Rights before they manipulate more cities into complying with unconstitutional federal actions.
