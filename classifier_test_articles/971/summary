Gutiérrez, who represents the outer edges of Chicago, argues that Chicago’s decision to to be a sanctuary city means that Chicago is willing to uphold the rights ensured by the Bill of Rights.
“Here’s how I see it — yeah, they call them sanctuary cities.
What I would say, Chris, is they’re Fourth Amendment cities.
But you’ve got to get a warrant.”Gutiérrez makes a compelling case for why sanctuary cities are actually upholders of American values enshrined in the Constitution.
The Trump administration is trying to strong arm sanctuary cities into giving up their cause by cutting their federal block grants.
