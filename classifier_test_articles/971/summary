President Trump signed an order Friday expanding his travel ban to six new countries, targeting nations the government says pose a threat because they don’t issue electronic passports or don’t do enough to share information with American authorities to vet their citizens looking to travel.
They join seven countries who are still part of the president’s previous travel ban: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.
For Sudan and Tanzania, only applicants under the diversity visa program will be blocked, a Homeland Security official said.
Mr. Trump issued his first travel ban Jan. 27, 2017, on seven majority-Muslim countries, virtually banning all entry of citizens from those countries.
That happened in April 2018 when Chad made enough improvements to be dropped from the travel ban, the official said.
