With House members dispersed around the country, Pelosi and Republican leaders were planning to bless the measure by a voice vote, probably with just a sprinkling of lawmakers present in the chamber.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It will pass with strong bipartisan support,” said Pelosi, D-Calif.

The government reported 3.3 million new weekly unemployment claims, four times the previous record. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a TV interview the economy “may well be in a recession.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Pelosi praised the bill’s expansion of unemployment benefits and provisions that encourage companies hit by the pandemic to keep paying their workers, even those who are furloughed. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70"> “We will have a victory tomorrow for America’s workers,” she said. “If somebody has a different point of view, they can put it in the record, but we’re not worried about that.”</p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="/></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-Hv2-_kTmjU0-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Hv2-_kTmjU0/0.jpg" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"/></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. It would steer substantial aid to larger industries, too.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The unanimous Senate vote late Wednesday came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has faced.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote — and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“Pray for one another, for all of our families and for our country,” said McConnell, R-Ky.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The package is intended as relief for a sinking economy and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that’s killed more than 21,000 people worldwide. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 1,000 people.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“This is a unique situation,” Powell told NBC’s “Today” show. “This is not a typical downturn.”</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">Coping with the Outbreak:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/cc19c462afd0a5ff2b1bfd9b8f4691d6">– <!-- -->Survivors of world conflicts offer perspective amid pandemic</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/e4d1d9775da37ff157f532c66de39042">– <!-- -->They already had an anxiety disorder.

And at a certain point, we will get the spread of the virus under control and at that time confidence will return, businesses will open again, people will come back to work.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Underscoring the effort’s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate on Wednesday slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states whose economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes. They said the legislation as written was so generous that workers like store clerks might opt to stay on unemployment rather than return to their jobs. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Wednesday’s delays followed Democratic stalling tactics earlier in the week as Schumer held out for additional money for states and hospitals and other provisions.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest.

With House members dispersed around the country, Pelosi and Republican leaders were planning to bless the measure by a voice vote, probably with just a sprinkling of lawmakers present in the chamber.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It will pass with strong bipartisan support,” said Pelosi, D-Calif. President Donald Trump has implored lawmakers to finish with the package so he can sign it into law.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"c1059850-6ae0-11ea-a9ba-5be88e6dd270\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The package comes to the House as fresh evidence emerges that the economy is in a recession. The government reported 3.3 million new weekly unemployment claims, four times the previous record. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a TV interview the economy “may well be in a recession.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pelosi praised the bill's expansion of unemployment benefits and provisions that encourage companies hit by the pandemic to keep paying their workers, even those who are furloughed. \u003c/p>\u003cp> “We will have a victory tomorrow for America's workers,” she said. “If somebody has a different point of view, they can put it in the record, but we’re not worried about that.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='d8aca0feb28543eca6e54a9995e99fb8' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. It would steer substantial aid to larger industries, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The unanimous Senate vote late Wednesday came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has faced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote — and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Pray for one another, for all of our families and for our country,\" said McConnell, R-Ky.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,\" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The package is intended as relief for a sinking economy and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed more than 21,000 people worldwide. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 1,000 people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a unique situation,\" Powell told NBC's “Today” show. “This is not a typical downturn.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"c97be2a0-6ae0-11ea-cf73-89cef51e5046\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Fed chief went on: \"What's happening here is people are being asked to close their businesses, to stay home from work and to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity and so they're pulling back. And at a certain point, we will get the spread of the virus under control and at that time confidence will return, businesses will open again, people will come back to work.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate on Wednesday slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states whose economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes. They said the legislation as written was so generous that workers like store clerks might opt to stay on unemployment rather than return to their jobs. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wednesday's delays followed Democratic stalling tactics earlier in the week as Schumer held out for additional money for states and hospitals and other provisions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers and food aid. \u003c/p>\u003cp>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said earlier he expected the measure to pass by a voice vote without lawmakers having to return to Washington.

President George W. Bush encouraged people to buy things after the terrorist attacks to help the economy — “patriots at the mall,” some called it — before the full war effort was underway. People lost jobs and homes in the financial crisis, but there was no summons for community response.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, with \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">the coronavirus\u003c/a>, it's as though a natural disaster has taken place in multiple places at once. Millions of people will likely lose their jobs. Businesses will shutter. Schools have closed. Thousands will die. Leaders are \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/b64cf00f37d8da2fad3533aa7686c53d\">ordering citizens into isolation\u003c/a> to stop the virus' march. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Suddenly, in the course of a few weeks, John F. Kennedy’s “ask what you can do for your country” injunction has come to life. Will Americans step up?\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b8e8eea4e893425798932d860f055ea2\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This is a new moment,” said Jon Meacham, a historian and author of “The Soul of America.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Prolonged sacrifice isn’t something we’ve been asked to do, really, since World War II,\" Meacham said. \"There was a kind of perpetual vigilance in the Cold War — what President Kennedy called ‘the long twilight struggle’ — but living with the fear of nuclear war is quite abstract compared to living with the fear of a virus and of a possible economic depression.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The second world war involved a common enemy and common purpose, with clear sides drawn across the globe. While President Donald Trump has at times tried to summon that feeling about attacking the coronavirus, he has abruptly changed course, suggesting Monday that restrictions he has sought on American life may be as short-lived as his slogan about \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/5d272073cbbc43b63d0ae7d9caeeeb6e\">“15 days to slow the spread,”\u003c/a> even as others are warning that most of the country is about to be hit by a crush of new cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Congress, some talk of coming together while others excoriate their partisan opposites. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., laid the early blame for lack of congressional action entirely at the feet of Democrats.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“A request to do anything becomes a point of attack, and we are always 10 steps back from where we should be on big legislative agreements,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton. “So intense polarization in a moment of crisis — with a president who is not interested in time-tested forms of governance and the job of uniting — make this much more difficult.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"5725e37a90f946f3b51cba1b4682f642\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That has not been universal. Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, moved swiftly to shut down most activity in his state and he implored Ohioans to help.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have not faced an enemy like we are facing today in 102 years,\" DeWine said recently. “You have to go back to the 1918 influenza epidemic. We are certainly at war. ... In the time of war, we must make sacrifices, and I thank all of our Ohio citizens for what they are doing and what they aren’t doing. You are making a huge difference, and this difference will save lives.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>As a nation, Americans are accustomed to seeing swaths of the country destroyed by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and blizzards. But there is then a season of rebuilding and renewal. The coronavirus, with its rapid spread, is giving Americans a public-health Katrina that knows few borders or boundaries, even though some parts of the country are suffering far more than others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To date, for many, the sacrifices have been mere inconveniences. No restaurants or movie theaters. Maybe the need to buy exercise equipment because the gym has closed. Or to leave the cardboard box from Amazon outside for 24 hours to make sure the virus doesn’t somehow enter the home.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"6dd25f2d65b44d1f884b23b8cd25ecdf\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A week of being told to work from home can resemble a working vacation. A week of not being able to work at all is frustrating but, potentially, eventually reversible. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But when a week bleeds into a month, or longer, how will we react?\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We used to tax in times of crisis. Now we don’t,\" Zelizer said. \"We asked people to ration in times of crisis. Now we don’t. We asked people to serve in times of crisis. Now we don’t. So this is a sea change. The thing is, Americans might not have a choice.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For many, the choices are personal and painful. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., cannot see her parents or her in-laws for the foreseeable future because she may have been exposed to the virus. But she is also seeing the impact of the virus in many other ways that are far more harmful.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think we are at the beginning stages of people understanding what the sacrifice is,” Spanberger said. “People with loved ones in nursing homes are told they can’t go visit their loved ones. That brings it home. For people who have kids, trying to explain why they can’t go to school, can’t have playdates, can’t see friends, can’t see family members.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is this element of everyone needs to disrupt their lives so that other people won’t die,” she said. “It’s different than eating less meat because of war or working in a factory because a husband is overseas. But you also can’t engage with the community, so it makes it harder. You can’t lean on your social circle, church, or school. All of those things are taken from us trying to keep people safe.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>With people being asked to sacrifice their jobs, their children’s education, their ability to commune with family and friends, Spanberger said, “the depth of empathy that that should be available and the strength of concerns over these decisions needs to be unparalleled and we do not see that, at least not from the administration.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>What the nation’s leaders do or don’t do will shape the course of the pandemic and its lethality. But it will be Americans' willingness to sacrifice that may well matter more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the end, this presents a great and compelling test of our national sense of ourselves as exceptional, generous and resilient,” Meacham said. “Perhaps we are all of those things. One thing’s for sure: We’re about to find out.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michael Tackett is deputy Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press.

But federal officials suggested that advisories could be loosened in areas not experiencing widespread infection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With lives and the economy hanging in the balance, Trump said Tuesday he was already looking toward easing the advisories that have sidelined workers, shuttered schools and led to a widespread economic slowdown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\" he said during a Fox News virtual town hall. Easter is just over two weeks away — Apr. 12. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full?\" Trump said in a subsequent interview. “You'll have packed churches all over our country.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And as scientists warned the worst is yet to come — with hospital systems tested beyond their capacity and health workers sidelined by exposure — Trump addressed the nation, saying he was beginning \"to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='ca74a5620e9d476494f8c9eac7aeeeb0' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump's comments came even as White House officials urged people who have left New York City amid the outbreak to self-quarantine for 14 days after their departure, owing to the widespread rate of infection in the metro area. It also follows on the president encouraging lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package — estimated at roughly $6 trillion once the Federal Reserve's actions are included — to ease the financial pain for Americans and hard-hit industries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction — staying home from work and isolating themselves — the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system, as it has in parts of Italy, leading to many more deaths. While the worst outbreaks are concentrated in certain parts of the country, such as New York, experts warn that the highly infectious disease is certain to spread.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se1:bf1d8990-6ae0-11ea-e808-330c1b2d3b1f\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-nRyaf\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nRyaf/7/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"USA counties (2018) choropleth map Mapping COVID-19 cases by county\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The U.S. is now more than a week into an unprecedented 15-day effort to encourage all Americans to drastically scale back their public activities.

Andrew Cuomo said his state's hospital system will soon hit a breaking point — resulting in avoidable deaths — even with the restrictions already in place. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I gave it two weeks,\" Trump said during the town hall from the Rose Garden.

She suggested that public health professionals could recommend a general easing, while pushing for local restrictions to remain in the hardest-hit areas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump acknowledged that some want the guidance to continue, but claimed without providing evidence that keeping the guidance in place would lead to deaths from suicide and depression.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This cure is worse than the problem,” Trump said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a press briefing Tuesday evening, Trump said public health officials and economists were “working to develop a sophisticated plan to open the economy as soon as the time is right — based on the best science, the best modeling and the best medical research there is anywhere on earth.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's enthusiasm for getting people back to work comes as he takes stock of the political toll the outbreak is taking. It sets up a potential conflict with medical professionals, including many within his government, who have called for more social restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, not fewer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, did not appear at the virtual town hall, but Trump denied there were any tensions between the two men.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I will be guided very much by Dr. Fauci and Deborah,” Trump said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the press briefing later, Fauci said, “No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.\" But he suggested he would be willing to examine the potential for easing the CDC advisories in areas that have been less affected by the outbreak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, told reporters Tuesday that “public health includes economic health.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That’s the key point.

Those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems.

Germany, a bastion of budgetary discipline, also approved a big fiscal boost.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The gains came even as the first reports arrived showing how badly the outbreak is hitting the global economy. In the United States, a preliminary reading on business activity in March showed the steepest contraction on record, going back to 2009.

NComcast said in a regulatory filing that the coronavirus and the measures taken to stop the virus from spreading are affecting its businesses in several ways, including theme park closures, movie premiere delays, canceled sports and the shutdown of TV and film production. The company said that the virus could have a “material adverse impact\" on its financial results.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TO YOUR HEALTH: The spread of the coronavirus has changed life as the world knew it, and that includes how we imbibe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Money once spent on booze in pubs, restaurants and bars, is going to six-packs or cases of wine and beer consumed at home, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday by Constellation Brands. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cities from San Francisco to New York have shut down the places where people gathered, at best allowing pick-up or delivery.

The goal is accepting an appropriate level of anxiety and living with some uncertainty.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You don't have to like that any of this is happening to accept that this is our reality right now,” said Vaile Wright, director of clinical research and quality at the American Psychological Association.

A mental health provider can help them set goals and limits, she said, while techniques for relaxation and meditation can help “turn off that heightened anxiety or stress response ... or at least to turn it down.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Somebody with obsessive-compulsive disorder might be encouraged to touch some surface they fear is contaminated, and then not wash their hands for 20 minutes, and even then for only the recommended 20 seconds rather than five minutes with scalding-hot water, Wright said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For people apprehensive about dealing with others, the public health advice about avoiding groups also makes therapy challenging, Gould said. The key thing is to stay connected to other people, and that can be done by social media, email, video conferencing or phone calls, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alvord, in fact, said she avoids the term “social distancing” and instead talks about “physical distancing and social connectedness.” That allows for connecting online, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It can be hard for anxiety-prone people to reach out when they feel overwhelmed, Wright said, so other people should put in the effort to contact them, just to ask how they're doing. “There's nothing wrong in talking about the virus in a productive way,” encouraging people to take care of themselves physically and emotionally without inducing panic and destructive riffs of “what-if,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Content:8700080593\" class=\"hub-link-embed\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>And it's OK to contact friends and family “and talk not at all about the virus right now,\" she said. “We need that too. We need a balance.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schwartz recommends that people staying home limit the amount of time spent listening to the news, which includes not leaving it on in the background. And he suggests staying busy with projects like cleaning closets and drawers and cooking with one's family, as well as getting outdoors for walks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alvord, who directs 18 therapists in two offices, said her practice, like many others, has moved its patients to online contact. She noted that thousands of psychologists signed up for her recent webinar on practicing psychology remotely in the pandemic age.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In her case, the shift was promoted both by people anxious about showing up in person and the practice's own precautions for a caseload that could land 50 people in a waiting room on a Saturday morning.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Research shows internet therapy can be as effective as doing in in person, Alvord said. But “it's different than having somebody in the office,” she said. “I only see you from the waist up ... I don't see you walking. I don't see all the full range of gestures.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gould said she recently moved all her sessions to telephone or videoconferencing, including group sessions.
