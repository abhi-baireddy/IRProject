"We have made it clear we would like to continue to buy Iranian oil.
People should not expect Turkey to turn its back on Iran just like that."

US officials have said that three of the eight waivers won't require extensions because they have eliminated Iranian oil imports.
Kalin said Turkey would not want to violate sanctions if a waiver were not extended.
