Democratic presidential candidates have started releasing their tax returns, and most of them give small amounts of their income to charity.
But many of those Democratic candidates' tax returns revealed how little they give to charity each year compared with average American households with similar income levels.
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke released 10 years of tax returns filed jointly with his wife, Amy.
Booker released 10 years of tax returns on Wednesday evening.
Meanwhile, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, even after demands from the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, setting up a long legal fight between the president and Congress.
