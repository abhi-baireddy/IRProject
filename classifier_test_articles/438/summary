Fresh off one fiscal showdown, Congress could soon face another, with the U.S. debt ceiling set to take effect again on March 2.
The debt ceiling is a statutory cap on federal borrowing.
Raising it does not authorize new spending but allows the government to borrow more to pay for spending that Congress already approved.
With the suspension now due to expire, the Congressional Budget Office said in a new report Tuesday that lawmakers will likely face a late summer or early fall deadline to raise the debt limit or risk defaulting on payments.
Lawmakers could decide to once again raise the borrowing limit as part of a broader deal addressing budget caps for fiscal 2020.
