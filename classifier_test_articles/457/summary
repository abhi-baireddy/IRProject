GettyA new policy proposal by the Trump administration calls for the surveillance of disabled peopleâ€™s social media profiles to determine the necessity of their disability benefits.
The administration has been working closely with the Social Security Administration in an effort to reduce false claims believing that social media holds a cache of information regarding eligibility of Social Security Disability Benefits.
They believe that by monitoring the social media accounts of disability benefit recipients, they can root out false claims and reduce the overall amount of money spent on the programs.
Additionally, studies have shown that a majority of social media users show only the good in their lives, not the hardships or difficulties.
Disabled people are people, and as such, lead complex lives with ups and downs like the rest of the population.
