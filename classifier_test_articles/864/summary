ALGONA, Iowa — It was the kind of question that a politician should have been able to handle with ease, but Representative Steve King is not any politician.
“Do you think a white society is superior to a nonwhite society?” Mary Lavelle, 63, asked, testing his reputation for white supremacist sympathies.
That’s so hypothetical,” Mr. King, Republican of Iowa, told her.
“I’ll say this, America is not a white society — it has never been a completely white society.
And I believe that every one of us, every one of us, is created in God’s image.”
