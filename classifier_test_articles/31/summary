"Foreign media organizations and journalists who cover stories in accordance with laws and regulations are always welcome in China, and will get continued assistance from our side," the spokesperson said in a statement.
"We call on foreign media outlets and journalists to play a positive role in advancing the mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world."
The Chinese government is notoriously restrictive of media operations â€” not only for Chinese nationals but also for foreign journalists working within its borders.
"Both countries should lift any applicable restrictions and allow professional media outlets to play their role of reporting the news and calling it like they see it."
