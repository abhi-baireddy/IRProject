Voting advocates raised concern Monday that Florida lawmakers are trying to water down a constitutional amendment passed last year that allows people with felony convictions to vote once they complete their sentences.
Last November, Florida voters overwhelmingly rejected that practice and approved voting rights restoration.
Voters approved an amendment that specifically says people convicted of “murder” and “felony sexual offenses” will remain permanently barred from voting.
A bill in the Florida House would exclude people convicted of first- and second-degree murder as well as a range of felony sexual offenses from voting.
He told the Orlando Sentinel that the constitutional amendment was unclear.
