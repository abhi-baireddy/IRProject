Is President Trump really rolling back the American empire?
Trump is not diminishing America's military footprint; if anything, he's expanding it.
Only a president determined to starve the beast would ultimately be able to shrink America's military presence around the world.
Worst of all, Trump doesn't just want to use the American military to accomplish his foreign policy objectives; he is also enlisting the American economy, wielding sanctions and tariffs like weapons.
Expecting Trump to rollback the American empire is a fool's dream.
