First lady Melania Trump was both cheered and loudly booed by students when she appeared Tuesday in Baltimore to speak at the B’MORE Youth Summit on Opioid Awareness.
Video showed that the first lady got the mixed greeting as she was introduced at the DEA-sponsored event at the University of Maryland Baltimore County — and again when she finished speaking.
It was unclear why the crowd of roughly 1,300 middle and high school students were booing the president’s wife.
But President Trump has repeatedly criticized the city while feuding with late House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings prior to his death Oct. 17 at the age of 68.
The Baltimore City Health Department said that in 2017, the city saw 761 drug- and alcohol-related intoxication deaths, 692 of which were opioid-related — more than twice the number of those killed in homicides, WBAL-TV reported.
