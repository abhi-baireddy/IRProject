Despite reports that African nations are overwhelmed by the deadly Ebola outbreak, President Obama on Wednesday expressed optimism that nations such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia eventually will get a handle on the worsening situation.
“On behalf of all of us here today, our thoughts and prayers for those who have been affected by the Ebola outbreak, especially those who have lost loved ones,” the president said.
CNN reported Wednesday that health workers in Sierra Leone say the government there is in over its head.
“I think that the government and the ministry of health here in Sierra Leone is not able to deal with this outbreak.
In addition to the rising death toll, major airlines such as British Airways have suspended all flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia.
