As he's often willing to prove, George Conway—husband to Presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway—isn't shy about his contempt for President Donald Trump.
This week alone, Conway questioned the President's mental fitness and the President called him a "total loser."
With the barrage of anti-Trump tweets appearing in conflict to his union with one of the President's staunchest allies, Conway gave insight as to why he's so vocal in his aversion to Trump.
Conway told the Washington Post:"The mendacity, the incompetence, it’s just maddening to watch.
Frankly, it’s so I don’t end up screaming at her about it.”While it may not sound like the healthiest arrangement, many understood his reasoning.
