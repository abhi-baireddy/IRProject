WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court has thrown out years of legal proceedings in the already-delayed military commission case against a Saudi charged in the deadly 2000 bombing of a U.S. warship.
An appellate panel in Washington said Tuesday that a military judge improperly continued to preside over the case after he sought a job in the Justice Department beginning in 2015.
Retired Air Force Col. Vance Spath took a job last year as an immigration judge in the Justice Department.
The military judge who briefly replaced Spath, Col. Shelly Schools, was taken off the case after it was revealed that Schools also was seeking to becoming an immigration judge.
The court also was critical of prosecutors, the Justice Department and the Court of Military Commission Review, which had upheld many of Spath’s orders.
