Every senator seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination voted to deny care to newborns who survive abortion.
The bill would have required doctors to provide care for infants who survive late term abortions, rather than letting those born alive die on the table.
Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said that the 2020 Democrats failed a vital test by toeing the party line at the expense of newborns.
While the vote failed in the Senate, Republicans are pushing similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats.
"Anyone who lacks the basic level of human compassion needed to vote in favor of this should quickly find another job."
