As surely as they are melting elsewhere around the world, glaciers are disappearing in North America, too.
Glacier-fed ecosystems are delicately balanced, populated by species that have adapted to the unique conditions of the streams.
As glaciers shrink and meltwater eventually declines, changes in water temperature, nutrient content and other characteristics will disrupt those natural communities.
Streams that are mostly fed by glacial meltwater often have unique species that have adapted to the cold conditions.
“When the glaciers disappear, those species will go extinct,” he said.
