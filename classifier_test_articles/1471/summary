That’s how many U.S. middle-class workers will be left without strong overtime pay protections under the Trump administration’s weak overtime rule proposed on March 22.
As a result, the share of salaried workers guaranteed overtime pay has plummeted from six in 10 in 1975 to less than one in 10 today.
Unsurprisingly, the weak Trump overtime proposal is deeply unpopular with voters.
Moreover, in every state, the legislature can act to protect overtime pay.
In the 2018 midterms, overtime pay already emerged as a key issue in several races.
