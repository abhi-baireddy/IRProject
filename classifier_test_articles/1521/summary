Seeking to curb teen vaping, San Francisco officials on Tuesday introduced legislation to ban the sale of electronic cigarettes until the federal government regulates them.
But vaping proponents who say e-cigarettes help adult smokers quit packs of Marlboros argued the proposal would unfairly target vaping products.
"It is hard for San Francisco to get even more absurd, but this proposal and the rhetoric around it is absolutely insane."
“They are trying to shut down a business that is operating peacefully in their city, Juul,” Conley said.
Manufacturers were supposed to submit vaping products for review by August 2018, but FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in 2017 delayed the deadline until 2022.
