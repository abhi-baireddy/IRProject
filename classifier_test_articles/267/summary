Washington (CNN) House Democrats have been holding multiple hearings this month to highlight the impacts of, and science around, climate change, but Republicans managed to scuttle one session Tuesday after just 10 minutes when only two Democrats showed up.
After opening statements in the House Natural Resources subcommittee hearing, GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert motioned to adjourn.
Such motions are common in Congress, usually used by the minority to make the point that they object to the point of a hearing.
All four Republicans were there, so the Republicans won and the hearing ended.
Gohmert called to adjourn the hearing because he believed the hearing's topic, entitled "The Denial Playbook: How Industries Manipulate Science and Policy from Climate Change to Public Health," falls outside of the Natural Resources Committee's jurisdiction.
