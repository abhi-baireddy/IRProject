Despite what political leaders want them to say, COVID-19 models will become less predictive exactly when we need them most.
That skepticism about what the models truly say will play a growing role in the discussion about when and how to “re-open” the country.
What the models are, in fact, is poorly represented by the policy makers touting them.
But it showed those outcomes could be mitigated through social distancing measures.
Another example: a March 25 article in the New York Times was intended to show the effects of two months of social distancing to “flatten the curve.” But it doesn’t extend past October.
