(Jim Urquhart/Reuters)If we stay calm and rational, we can defeat the enemy.
Envision the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, as a living, breathing enemy â€” which, of course, is exactly what it is.
To win its war against Americans, COVID-19 must infect and sicken lots of Americans each day.
If it cannot infect enough victims to multiply and sustain a hungry army of viruses, COVID-19 will soon sputter and die.
But if we stay calm and rational, we can easily defeat the enemy, whose reputation is likely far scarier than its reality.
