In a nuclear family, the end of the marriage means the end of the family as it was previously understood.
By the 1920s, the nuclear family with a male breadwinner had replaced the corporate family as the dominant family form.
When we have debates about how to strengthen the family, we are thinking of the two-parent nuclear family, with one or two kids, probably living in some detached family home on some suburban street.
The constellation of forces that had briefly shored up the nuclear family began to fall away, and the sheltered family of the 1950s was supplanted by the stressed family of every decade since.
The focus has always been on strengthening the nuclear family, not the extended family.
