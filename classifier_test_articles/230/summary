A chemical plant near Houston has been burning since Sunday morning.
The chemical plant is closed and evacuated.
The plant owner, Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC), said while the fire looks ominous, no one is in danger.
Eight of those massive chemical tanks are in flames right now, seven more are in the path of the fire.
The company continues to say toxins are not in the plume of smoke that can be seen for miles.
