The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court Monday night to clear the way for four federal executions, after a judge in Washington, D.C., put them on hold.
Attorney General William Barr revived the federal death penalty after a 17-year hiatus in July.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said that “uniform procedure” violates a provision of the Federal Death Penalty Act (FDPA).
That provision says federal executions must be carried out “in the manner prescribed by the law of the state” in which the death sentence issued.
“The statute’s use of the word ‘manner’ thus includes not just execution method but also execution procedure.”“That reading is implausible,” Solicitor General Noel Francisco countered in Monday night’s legal filing at the Supreme Court.
