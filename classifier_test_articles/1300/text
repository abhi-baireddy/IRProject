CNN anchor Dana Bash and her guest criticized former first lady Michelle Obama for a criticism she lobbed against President Donald Trump that also appeared to mock divorced fathers.

Obama was speaking in London, England, when she told the audience that the United States was comparable to a teenager who was from a broken home.

"We come from a broken family we're a teenager, where you know, we're a little unsettled, you know, having good parents you know, is tough, you know," Obama said.

"Sometimes you spend weekends with divorced dad and that feels like it's fun, but then you get sick," she explained. "That's what America is going through, we're kinda living with a divorced dad."

Bash and her guest CNN White House reporter Kate Bennett heavily criticized the former first lady for mocking divorced fathers as unserious parental figures.

"To make the analogy to divorced dads for someone like Michelle Obama is terrible unwoke to use a term that the kids use," Bash said.

"It's not the 1950s," she added. "There are a lot of divorced dads."

Bennett agreed and called it a "really big misstep" on the part of the former first lady.
