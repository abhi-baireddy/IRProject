CNN anchor Dana Bash and her guest criticized former first lady Michelle Obama for a criticism she lobbed against President Donald Trump that also appeared to mock divorced fathers.
"We come from a broken family we're a teenager, where you know, we're a little unsettled, you know, having good parents you know, is tough, you know," Obama said.
Bash and her guest CNN White House reporter Kate Bennett heavily criticized the former first lady for mocking divorced fathers as unserious parental figures.
"To make the analogy to divorced dads for someone like Michelle Obama is terrible unwoke to use a term that the kids use," Bash said.
