Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Watters’ World,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said misinformation came out of China when the coronavirus outbreak began.
When asked if China misled the world, Fauci said, “You know I don’t know where missteps went.
Only thing I know with the end result was that early on we did not get correct information.
And then when we finally did get the virus here it became clear when he started looking at what was going on that that was misinformation right from the beginning.
So who’s ever faults that was, you know, we’re going back to take a look at that when this is all over but clearly not right information that was given to us.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
