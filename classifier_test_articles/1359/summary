“Only with this intelligence received is it now possible for Deutsche Bank to start global investigations,” it notes.
As part of its investigation, Deutsche Bank sent 149 “suspicious activity reports” to the National Crime Agency in London.
Similar disclosures of potential money-laundering transactions were made to authorities in the US and elsewhere – with 30 private and corporate Deutsche Bank clients reported.
Between 2011 and 2018, it paid $14.5bn in fines, with exposure to dubious Russian money a regular theme.
Deutsche Bank said it could not comment on “potential or ongoing investigations”, or on “any matters regarding our regulators”.
