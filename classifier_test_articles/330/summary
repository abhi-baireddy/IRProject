In seeking the 2020 nomination for the presidency, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had made overtures that he’d operate more firmly within the Democratic Party as the party adopted procedural reforms to accommodate his concerns.
It also raised alarm and questions as to whether Sanders was running to lead the party or to fundamentally change it.
Sanders’ campaign was initially uncertain of how it should respond to the post.
Among some Democrats, there was a sense of bewilderment that the Sanders campaign had gone—as one operative put it—”nuclear” over a mere web video.
Another CAP board member, Stacey Abrams, declined to comment.
