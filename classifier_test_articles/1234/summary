Multiple current and former White House officials-turned-witnesses for Special Counsel Robert Mueller are fretting that their identities will be exposed in the full report, outing them as the sources of damning information about President Donald Trump.
According to an NBC News report, many of them have contacted the Justice Department to determine if their names, or at least obvious clues about their identities, will be redacted from the report.
The DOJ has reportedly stayed mum.
An NBC source close to the White House reported “breakdown-level anxiety” among those who shared information with Mueller.
The witnesses are parsing phrases spoken by Attorney General William Barr that information about “peripheral third parties” could be redacted if it would “infringe on the personal privacy.” But for now, the witnesses, like everyone else, will have to wait until Thursday to read all about it.
