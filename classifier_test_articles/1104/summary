Microsoft announced the new HoloLens 2 on Sunday (Feb. 24), updating the mixed reality headset with a greater field of view, better ergonomics, and more processing power.
Quartz got a private demo of the HoloLens 2 at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona the morning after it was announced.
It’s jarring to see digital items suddenly get cut out of view when they’re too big for the device’s field of view.
“I want it to be instinctual,” Microsoft technical fellow Alex Kipman, who led the development of the HoloLens 2, told Quartz.
But consumer AR is undoubtedly coming, and whenever it decides to make a consumer headset, Microsoft has a head start.
