Sen. Bernie Sanders on releasing his tax returns: You'll see them "soon."
He tried to excuse his failure to release his tax returns last time on the grounds that he didn’t wind up getting the nomination.
Now, he’s not actually going to withhold his tax returns through the entire primary season, right?
(New Jersey is even trying to bar to ballot access for those who haven’t turned over 10 years of tax returns.)
And, to exploit Trump’s vulnerabilities — including his foreign entanglements, conflicts of interest and possible constitutional violations — Democrats will need to be above reproach.
