Not a single human being donated to Rep. Chris Collins’ (R-N.Y.) reelection campaign in the first three months of 2019.
Collins was arrested in August and charged with 10 criminal counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, making false statements to the FBI.
The Tuesday Group and RMSP each donated $1,000 to Collins in February, and each gave another $1,000 in March.
Donovan’s campaign committee also donated $1,000 to Collins in February along with a number of his House Republican colleagues.
But controversy over Collins’ indictment last year made his 2018 reelection race a close one.
