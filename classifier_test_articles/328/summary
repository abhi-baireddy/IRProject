The traditional Holy Week starts tomorrow with Palm Sunday, and across the country, many churches are shuttered -- most voluntarily but some by decree of the government.
But in the meantime, churches have watched as their Sunday gift collection plates have disappeared with nothing to replace them.
This has led to a financial crisis for many churches that depend almost solely on donations from worshippers for their survival.
It's a fact of financial life for these churches that Holy Week brings in a large amount in donations, much of which goes to fund important charity work.
“It’s a concern for our pastors in our churches because the celebrations of Holy Week bring together a great number of people,” said Bishop Robert Casey of the Archdiocese of Chicago.
