President Donald Trump's attorneys are urging a financial firm to ignore a Congressional subpoena demanding the president's financial records, Politico reported on Monday.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) issued a subpoena to accounting conglomerate Mazars USA, which is in possession of Trump's coveted tax documents.
According to Politico, attorneys William S. Consovoy and Stefan Passantino put Mazars "on notice"—implying legal action should the firm comply with the subpoena.
“The House Oversight Committee is not a miniature Department of Justice, charged with investigating and prosecuting potential federal crimes," they said.
Cummings' Republican counterpart on the Oversight, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, called Cummings' subpoena a "gravely dangerous" abuse of power.
