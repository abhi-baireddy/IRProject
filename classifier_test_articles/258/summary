(CNN) Stephen Colbert will not be taking his show to New Zealand this month.
The host of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" revealed on air Monday night that he's canceled a scheduled trip to New Zealand in the wake of last week's mass shootings in Christchurch.
Colbert had planned to visit the country as part of a surprise overseas tour.
"Obviously we're not going to go down now, but we hope to go down in the future.
And again, we want to say to everyone down there how sad and heartbroken we are for what that country is going through."
