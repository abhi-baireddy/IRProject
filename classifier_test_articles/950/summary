The human brain continues working after we die in order to “make us aware of what’s happening around us,” according to new research.
However, a new study suggests your consciousness carries on functioning after your heart stops beating and your body movements fail.
This means you are essentially ‘trapped’ inside your dead body with your brain still working, if only for a short time.
Dr. Sam Parnia is studying consciousness after death and examining cardiac arrest cases in Europe and the US.
The expert ventured that people who have survived cardiac arrest later accurately described what was happening around them after their hearts stopped beating.
