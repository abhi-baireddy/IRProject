Sen. Ron Johnson wants to make it legal to detain immigrant babies and children for up to three months.
Allowing the Trump administration to keep kids in detention facilities is as cruel as it gets, but Johnson tried hard to make himself sound reasonable.
"I’m happy to compromise at 60," Johnson told the Washington Post, referencing the number of days he thinks is reasonable to lock up babies and young children.
"It doesn’t look that these people have been abused, or spent three nights in a tractor-trailer," Johnson told the Washington Post.
Sickest of all, the Washington Post reported that Johnson is tentatively naming the bill that would allow the government to jail kids the "Families Act."
