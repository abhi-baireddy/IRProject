Republican at center of North Carolina election fraud scandal will not run in new election Mark Harris cited health concerns Tuesday when he announced his decision.
Mark Harris, the Republican candidate in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District election in 2018, said Tuesday that he will not run in the district's forthcoming special election, a race ordered by state officials after evidence of election fraud "tainted" results that had shown Harris as the first-place finisher.
He disclosed his medical issues publicly with the North Carolina State Board of Elections last week during his testimony at an evidentiary hearing on potential election fraud in the race.
In a statement, the North Carolina Republican Party said it was supportive of Harris' decision, writing that it "unequivocally support[s] his call for a new election," and that "there are numerous quality candidates that are discussing a run."
In his statement, Harris endorsed one of those potential candidates, Union County, North Carolina Commissioner Stony Rushing.
