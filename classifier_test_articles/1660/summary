The key to controlling health care spending, according to this view, is to give individuals “skin in the game”—that is, financial incentives to be more prudent health care consumers.
The basic idea is to limit the federal government’s role (and financial stake) in health care by shifting more of the costs and burdens onto individuals via measures such as high-deductible health care plans.
This, in turn, will force providers to be more efficient, reduce their prices, stop pushing unnecessary care, and thus lower the nation’s health care bill.
If these programs are dismantled, or even slowed, we will continue to see rising health care spending—and worsening health in America.
If the GOP is serious about lowering costs, it should reconsider its assumptions about how the health care market works.
