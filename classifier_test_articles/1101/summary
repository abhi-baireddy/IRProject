For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they’ve found someone with whom they want to co-parent.
Stats just released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of these shifts.
Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies.
Only one age group saw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year.
The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however, signals a bigger shift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers.
