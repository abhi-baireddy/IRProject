Appeals court says special counsel Robert Mueller 'properly appointed'; orders ex-Stone aide to testify The appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller, a former associate of Stone.
Obtained by ABC NewsMiller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Mueller's federal grand jury, which has been met with heavy legal resistance.
The three judge panel found that Mueller was properly appointed in the spring of 2017 by the then-deputy attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, after the attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia investigation.
“Because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, and the Deputy Attorney General became the head of the Department by virtue of becoming the Acting Attorney General as a result of a vacancy created by the disability of the Attorney General through recusal on the matter, we hold that Miller’s challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails.
Kamenar’s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller’s appointment was not handled properly.
