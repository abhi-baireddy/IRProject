Many prospective migrants to the U.S. say that they are adopting a strategy to wait until President Donald Trump's time in office is over and hope a Democrat opens up immigration opportunities.
"My idea is to go to Tijuana, and in Tijuana I'm gonna go ahead and try to make a living until Trump leaves the office," said the migrant, whose name was withheld.
"Once he leaves the office hopefully, everything is going to go back to normal, or the situation is going to get better for immigration laws," he added.
"But once Trump is defeated and the Democrats take over, things are going to get better."
On Monday, hundreds of Central Americans attempted to rush into Mexico through the border from Guatemala on their way to the U.S. border.
