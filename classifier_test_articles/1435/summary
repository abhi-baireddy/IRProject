Omar reported receiving a "sharp increase" in death threats after the tweet, many of them explicitly referencing Trump's post.
The logic here is stunning: For those who demonstrate insufficient patriotism, death threats are no problem.
Real Americans police each other's patriotism, Trump seems to be saying, and those who are "extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country" cannot expect to get off scot-free.
This poisonous sort of patriotism — I'll use Trump's word, though "nationalism" would serve as well — is jealous and officious by nature.
Trump's comfort with his role in Omar's receipt of death threats makes a certain grim sense by this rationale).
