Fox News’ chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge believes a claim by Republican North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows of a coordinated effort to hurt President Trump -- including "sitting ambassadors," the FBI and the Department of Justice -- also likely involves someone in the State Department.
It was also revealed that Steele used a now deactivated “user-generated” website called “iReport” by CNN to gather much of the dossier information.
Meadows appeared on “Hannity” Monday, when he made the accusation that there was a “coordinated effort” aimed at the president.
“It's additional information that is coming out that will show not only was there no collusion, but there was a coordinated effort to take this president down.
There are players now, even ambassadors, that are sitting ambassadors that were involved in part of this with the FBI-DOJ,” Meadows told Hannity
