For people with addictions in recovery, it’s a daily checklist that existed long before this global health crisis did.
We spoke to three people in recovery about what’s keeping them alive, healthy, and sober in a time of unprecedented isolation.
Matiya, whose last name we are not using to protect her identity as someone in recovery, has been in recovery since 2017 and is confronting the new reality of quarantine with mixed feelings.
“If you’re alone and you have nowhere to be, then why stay sober?” Matiya says.
But in a community founded on fellowship and in-person meetings, the ripple effects of quarantine are still being felt hard.
