Senator Elizabeth Warren has hired the largest campaign staff in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, quickly building a payroll that far exceeds her Democratic rivals, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Elections Commission.
Building a large campaign staff can create challenges.
About half of the staff, her campaign said, are positioned in early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
However, her campaign disclosures revealed that she may be making tradeoffs.
Sanders spent about $1.6 million and Harris $1 million.
