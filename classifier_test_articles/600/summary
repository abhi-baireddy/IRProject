Supreme Court to Hear Trump Administration’s Appeal About Endangered Species ReportThe Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s request to review a lower court ruling that would force it to make public sensitive documents from its internal deliberations about changing the regulations for power plants’ cooling water intake systems.
Eventually, in 2018, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Trump administration to hand over the relevant papers.
On Oct. 25, 2019, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to consider its appeal of the 9th Circuit decision that ordered disclosure.
“We are pleased the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this landmark case,” a Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson told The Epoch Times.
In an unrelated case concerning the Central Intelligence Agency, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh rejected efforts to make draft agency documents public.
