About the only thing we know for sure about Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh is that we don’t trust her.
We certainly didn’t know that she had her own self-published children’s book series called “Healthy Holly,” for one thing.
I previously noted here that Baktimore Mayor Catherine Pugh had sold 20,000 copies of her self-published children's book to the U of MD Medical System, on whose board she sits.
What we already knew:The U of MD Medical System paid Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh $500K for 100K copies of her Healthy Holly children's book while Pugh was on the system's board.
New story from @BaltimoreBrew on the warehouse where the 8700 Healthy Holly books are located.
