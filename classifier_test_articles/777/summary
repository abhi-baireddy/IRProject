Many calls to the city’s child abuse hotline come from teachers and hospital staff, who are required by law to report signs of abuse or neglect.
In New York, the ten neighborhoods with the highest number of ACS cases, mostly in the Bronx, also represent the lowest incomes, highest unemployment, and greatest income-to-rent disparities in the city.
“It’s not neglect,” said Jeanette Vega, the training director at Rise, a New York nonprofit that advocates for parents with open ACS cases.
“We’re poor—this is poverty.”This recognition that poor parents need help, not suspicion and condemnation, represents a substantial departure from the understanding many families have of ACS.
“People call me all the time, saying, ‘I reached out to ACS for help, and it destroyed my family.’”
