Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, on Tuesday called for China to shutter its “gross” wet markets, threatening to leverage U.S. trade unless the communist government moves to prevent the spread of deadly viruses originating in such venues.
“These are open-air markets where they sell monkey, they sell bat.
We think this whole thing started from the transmission from a bat to a human.”Mr. Graham referred to the novel coronavirus, which is believed to have originated at a wildlife market in Wuhan, China.
Exclusive: China’s government found 2,000 new animal viruses including deadly bat viruses and studied them at unsecured lab 3 miles from Wuhan wild animal market.
“I’m going to write a letter to the Chinese ambassador saying if you don’t shut those wet markets down, our trading relationship is going to change,” said Mr. Graham, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee.
