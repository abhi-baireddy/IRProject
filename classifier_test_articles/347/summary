An elite New York City high school that has a total of 895 spots in its freshman class accepted seven black students Monday.
Stuyvesant High School is a selective specialized school with the city’s highest cutoff for a test that allows students to gain admission into NYC’s specialized high schools, The New York Times reported Monday.
“To only have 7 Black students accepted into Stuyvesant (a *public* high school) tells us that this is a system failure,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
68% of all NYC public school students are Black or Latino.
