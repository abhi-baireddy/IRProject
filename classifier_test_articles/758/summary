Climate Change Was The Engine That Powered Hurricane Maria's Devastating RainsEnlarge this image toggle caption Carlos Giusti/AP Carlos Giusti/APHurricane Maria was the rainiest storm known to have hit Puerto Rico, and climate change is partly to blame, according to a new study.
When Maria hit in 2017, it dropped nearly a quarter of that annual rainfall in just one day.
As climate change models have grown more sophisticated, the field of so-called attribution science has grown more robust, allowing scientists to start investigating how our current global climate affects specific weather events.
This latest paper on Hurricane Maria makes a similar connection.
That backs up results published in another paper last year that found climate change is causing some storms to dump 5 percent to 10 percent more rain than they would otherwise.
