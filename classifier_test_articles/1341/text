This guy never changes.

Last week Senator Mitt Romney joined other anti-Trump Republican Senators to vote against President Trump’s emergency order on the US southern border.

Today Senator Mitt Romney attacked Republican President Donald Trump for his attacks on John McCain who lied to Americans and voted against Obamacare reform after promising to replace it.

I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 19, 2019

This was after President Trump was asked today about John McCain’s last ditch attacks on the American public.

President Trump pointed out McCain’s lies on Obamacare.

Trump called it “disgraceful.”

And John McCain also spread the fake Russia dossier wide and far.

Trump has every right to detest that man.
