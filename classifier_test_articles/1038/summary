The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota’s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory and suppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominant state.
The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a U.S. Senate race in North Dakota that was seen as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate.
North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provable street address, which Secretary of State Al Jaeger says guards against fraud.
U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout.
Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp’s surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law.
