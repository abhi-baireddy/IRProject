Hispanic Americans are set to outpace black Americans as the largest voting minority group in the 2020 election for the first time ever, new research finds.
Pew Research Center projections predict that Hispanic American voters will now be the largest voting minority in the 2020 presidential election, passing black American voters for the first time in United States history.
This translates to about 32 million Hispanics who will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election and about 30 million eligible black American voters.
Meanwhile, eligible Hispanic voters have boomed in the last two decades â€” expected to nearly double their voting share of the electorate by 2020.
Foreign-born voters, as research by Axios, the New York Times, and Ronald Brownstein has confirmed, are more likely than native-born Americans to vote for Democrats.
