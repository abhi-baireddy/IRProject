Under President Yanukovych, Ukraine was a kleptocracy run by and for a gang of crooks who had carved up the country after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Manafort, of course, is now in jail, having been convicted of multiple counts of financial fraud related to his role in Ukraine.
He headed the Party of Regions, a criminal organization masquerading as Ukraine’s largest political party.
It is out of character for Paul Manafort to work for nothing, particularly when he’d just lost such a lucrative income stream.
The Paul Manafort who presented himself to Trump certainly had an impressive track record in political campaigning in America and around the world.
