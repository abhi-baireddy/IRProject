THINGS GETTING LEGALSCOTUSThe StoryYesterday, the Supreme Court handed the Trump administration an immigration win.
A 1996 law says that the federal gov can detain any immigrant convicted of certain crimes "when the alien is released."
A lower court ruled that immigrants could only be detained without a bond hearing if they were detained right after release.
But the ruling gives President Trump more authority as he moves towards hardline immigration policies.
President Trump says he'll tap the former Delta pilot and exec as the new FAA Administrator.
