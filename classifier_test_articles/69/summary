After lobbying to kill consumer privacy rules at the federal level, big telecom is now taking aim at individual state efforts to protect your privacy online.
But telecom experts say the industry’s grasping at straws as it attempts to dodge accountability for a decade rife with telecom related privacy abuses.
“Big broadband is clearly trying untested First Amendment arguments in the hope that something sticks,” former FCC lawyer Gigi Sohn told Motherboard.
At the same time, the telecom sector has fought tooth and nail against the passage of federal privacy rules of any kind, Sohn said.
“The so-called ‘problem’ of state broadband privacy laws like Maine’s is one of the ISPs own making,” Sohn said.
