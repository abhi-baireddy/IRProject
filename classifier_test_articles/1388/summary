Forced arbitration effectively operates as a secretive, privatized justice system that is stacked in favor of big corporations.
That’s why we launched the Pipeline Parity Project, a grassroots campaign of law students fighting to end forced arbitration, stop workplace discrimination, and unrig the legal system.
Just one year later, organized students have secured unprecedented disclosure of forced arbitration in the legal profession and forced some of the country’s largest firms to drop arbitration agreements.
But as future lawyers, we know that going workplace by workplace to end forced arbitration isn’t enough.
And we want our future colleagues to realize that forced arbitration unethically prevents the disempowered from accessing justice.
