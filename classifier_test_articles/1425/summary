Yes, President Trump is vulnerable in 2020.
The only kind of Republican who would have a shot of defeating the president in a primary would be a more competent Trumpist than Trump himself.
First these Republicans considered Trump a sideshow and a buffoon whose sky-high poll numbers in the months leading up the start of 2016 primary season meant nothing.
Then they assumed Trump's string of early primary victories would give way to defeat once the anybody-but-Trump vote coalesced around a suitable alternative.
Donald Trump owns the Republican Party.
