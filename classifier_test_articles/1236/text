As former Trump fixer Michael Cohen prepared to testify in public on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee, Trump loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) tweeted an ominous message at him Tuesday.

Hey @MichaelCohen212 – Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot… — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 26, 2019

Cohen testified behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, and he’ll testify behind closed doors again on Thursday, before the House Intelligence Committee.

Gaetz isn’t a member of either the House Oversight or Intelligence committees. But he is close with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), having appeared with him on the congressional campaign trail and in frequent cable TV interviews.

After sending the tweet Tuesday, Gaetz told Vox’s Alex Ward that he was “witness testing,” not witness tampering.

He added to The Daily Beast: “This is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas.”
