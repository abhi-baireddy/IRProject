As former Trump fixer Michael Cohen prepared to testify in public on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee, Trump loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) tweeted an ominous message at him Tuesday.
Hey @MichaelCohen212 – Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?
Gaetz isn’t a member of either the House Oversight or Intelligence committees.
But he is close with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), having appeared with him on the congressional campaign trail and in frequent cable TV interviews.
After sending the tweet Tuesday, Gaetz told Vox’s Alex Ward that he was “witness testing,” not witness tampering.
