Warren, Beto, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand are open to the idea.
Yes, radical Democratic pronouncements will earn them a wave of negative media attention on Fox News and in conservative media, but not a single Democratic candidate is trying to win that demographic.
But if a Democratic candidate breaks in even small ways from the emerging online orthodoxy, watch them trend on Twitter.
And in American politics, the people who care the most tend not to be moderate, either in temperament or ideology.
Twitter politics is extremist politics, and fighting one norm-breaker by creating another is an excellent way for the Democrats to fail again.
