President Trump vowed earlier this month to skip the dinner and hold a rally.

The White House Correspondents’ Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents’ Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the United States. It’s been a tradition since 1921 and was usually attended by the President and the Vice President.

Last year the White House Correspondents’ Association hired gutter comedienne Michelle Wolf to hurl vile insults at Sarah Sanders as she sat on the stage in front of the crowd. It was as disgusting a performance as we have seen in recent years.

Democrats loved it.

Trump is right to leave town for this crude event.

Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale weighed in on the rally.
