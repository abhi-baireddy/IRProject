Various parts of the document seem to spell out bad news for Donald Trump.
It’s not the revelation that Robert Mueller appears to have been investigating everyone in Donald Trump’s inner circle a year before the Michael Cohen raid, though that’s pretty ugly.
So those nineteen blacked out pages are almost certainly evidence against a fish who is equal to, or bigger than, Michael Cohen.
Some of it could theoretically be about the likes of Elliott Broidy, as we just learned this week that his office was raided a couple months after the Cohen raid.
But really, the blacked out parts are most likely about Donald Trump – and that would mean that the SDNY is building a massive criminal case against him.
