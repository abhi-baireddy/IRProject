And in both cities, and all over the country, political races are crowded, with double-digit numbers of candidates vying for office: 14 (four of them women) for mayor of Chicago !
This move away from political apathy is evident from high office down to the municipal level.
We saw this in the midterms as well, as a record number of women -- 117-- ran (and won) across the country.
What a full-throated endorsement of the enduring strength of American democracy, and the promise of our political system.
