The US House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to revoke Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, handing the president a stinging rebuke on his signature issue.
Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border earlier this month after Democrats refused to give him more than $5bn in funds for the wall.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is trying to "bend the law" with his declaration of a national emergency on the southern border.
Senate voting on Trump's emergency order could drag under a rarely used procedure, which an aide said is possibly a first for the chamber.
Trump's declaration of a national emergency gives him access to about $3.6bn in funding for military construction projects to divert to border fencing.
