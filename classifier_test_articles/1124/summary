As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump promised to put some reasonable limitations on how the United States conducted its post-9/11 wars across the Middle East.
The congressional resolution is unnecessary, Trump says, because "the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen."
That law was passed in the closing stages of the Vietnam War, with the intention of preventing a president from getting America into another years-long conflict without congressional authorization (please, hold your laughter).
Congress never authorized war, so it's unconstitutional and unlawful for the president to have entered the U.S. into hostilities.
But that won't be enough until America has a president actually willing to rein in America's foreign military excursionsâ€”instead of merely promising to do so to get elected.
