West Virginia's attorney general filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a retired Catholic bishop and a diocese alleging that they knowingly employing pedophile priests and failed to conduct adequate background checks.
"The diocese and its bishops chose to cover up and conceal arguably criminal behavior of admitted child sex abusers," the lawsuit says.
In response, the diocese issued a statement saying it "strongly and unconditionally rejects" the lawsuit's claim that it isn't committed to protecting children.
The diocese said that some of the allegations in the lawsuit are more than 50 years old and are not accurately described.
He was accused of molesting kids while director of a Catholic summer youth program, Camp Tygart, where he worked through 1976.
