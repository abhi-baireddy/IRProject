The Trump campaign reported to the FEC that they have raised a whopping $30.3 million for the January-March quarter.
They also reported cash on hand of $40.8 million, swamping the president's nearest Democratic challenger, Bernie Sanders.
“The president is in a vastly stronger position at this point than any previous incumbent president running for re-election, and only continues to build momentum,” said Trump re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale.
The Trump campaign touted its small-dollar grassroots appeal, announcing that 98.79 percent of first-quarter contributions were $200 or less, and that the average donation to the campaign was $34.26.
