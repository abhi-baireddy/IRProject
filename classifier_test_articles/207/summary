Getty ImagesHouse and Senate Democrats have amped up calls for the attorney general to release to Congress a full, unredacted version of Mueller's report.
The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a hastily arranged press conference Wednesday evening.
House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, and other Democrats are pushing hard for an un-redacted version of the report.
They also say Mueller's decision not to prosecute Trump does not necessarily mean he did not commit impeachable offenses.
Based on their findings, The Journal reported, the committee will decide whether to subpoena the department for a full version of the report, as well as its underlying evidence.
