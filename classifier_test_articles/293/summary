Hair discrimination is not just at the workplace, it has found its way into the educational arena.
In December 2018, Andrew Johnson, a Black high school wrestler in New Jersey was humiliated and subjected to racial discrimination when a white referee with a history of racism forced him to cut his locs or forfeit his match.
Last month, Asia Simo, a 17-year-old from Louisiana, was kicked off her school’s cheerleading team due to her hair.
'Normal' looked like a white child's hair, and everything else is not normal," García said.
CROWN (Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act, which bans the discrimination of people based on their hair, has been passed in California, New York and New Jersey.
