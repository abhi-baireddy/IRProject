New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern scored a powerful victory against terror simply by refusing to say the Christchurch attacker’s name.
When terrorists strike, the immediate damage—deaths, injuries, destruction—isn’t their ultimate goal.
Their intent is far more ambitious, though intangible: They seek to cause terror, and for that, they need visibility.
It makes terrorists look more important and powerful than they are, and provides a platform to their messages.
It also encourages copycats to to embrace the same murderous ideals and seek similar exposure.
