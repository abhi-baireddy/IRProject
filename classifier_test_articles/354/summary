The U.S. Supreme will not take up the death penalty case of Keith Tharpe, a black Georgia death row inmate.
The Supreme Court turned the case away, clearing the state of Georgia to schedule his execution.
"What happened in Mr. Tharpe's death penalty case was wrong."
In 2018, the case came back before the 11th Circuit after a Supreme Court stay of execution.
America, where white supremacists can still kill people of color and do it with the approval of the Supreme Court.
