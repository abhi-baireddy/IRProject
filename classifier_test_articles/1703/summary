It was a tense couple of moments just before noon local time Monday in the British territory of Gibraltar.
The twin-engine aircraft was 2.2 miles west of the runway, about 375 feet above the Bay of Gibraltar, descending at 656 feet per minute.
“Suddenly we felt the plane drop and rock violently from side to side,” recalled Lisa Huxstep, a U.K. passenger onboard the flight.
I gripped his hand and prayed.”Huxstep said the plane endured the rocking nine times in either direction before leveling out.
Flight data shows that the plane got as low as 300 feet — one football field — above the ground.
