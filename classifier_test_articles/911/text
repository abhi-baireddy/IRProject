Michael Cohen’s opening statement to a Congressional committee has been released and it paints a disturbing picture of Donald Trump. And for those who say he isn’t credible, Cohen has brought documents he says will back up many of his claims. Here are some of the more significant things he is expected to say:

“A lot of people have asked…whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. …Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails.”

“He told me black people would never vote for him because they are too stupid.”

“He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.”

“The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.”

“Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.”

“Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie.”
