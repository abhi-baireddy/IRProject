FILE PHOTO: A model of the nuclear reactor "Hualong One" is pictured at the booth of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) at an expo in Beijing, China April 29, 2017.
China signed a technology transfer deal with the United States in 2006 that put the AP1000 at the “core” of its atomic energy program.
It also pledged to use advanced third-generation technology in its safety review after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.
But by the time the world’s first AP1000 and EPR made their debuts in China last year, Chinese designs had become just as viable.
“(Hualong One) is competitive,” said Li Xiaoming, assistant general manager of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).
