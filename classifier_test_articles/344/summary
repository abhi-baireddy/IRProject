A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against a local school district for its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first.
The policy enables children, of any age, to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent."
The school policy allows students to pick new names and pronouns they can use at school regardless of whether they have a parent's permission.
The parents argue the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause, which protects parents' right to raise their children according to the parents' beliefs.
A public school district should not, and cannot, make decisions reserved for parents," WILL President and General Counsel Rick Esenberg said in a statement.
