It’s true that Bloomberg spent about $500 million on political advertisements.
It’s also true that the United States has a population of approximately 327 million people.
However, if you doled out $500 million equally among 327 million people, they would not each receive $1 million.
In reality, Bloomberg spent enough to give each American about $1.50.
If Bloomberg were to divide his wealth equally among the American population, each person would receive less than $200.
