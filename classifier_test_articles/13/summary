President Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual townhall that he wants the country’s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus taskforce, Trump said he "would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."
Trump argued he doesn’t want “to turn the country off” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic.
He also said he worries the U.S. will see "suicides by the thousands" if coronavirus devastates the economy.
