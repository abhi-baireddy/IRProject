Democrats are increasingly ready to acknowledge a problem at the southwestern border — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week dubbed it “a humanitarian crisis” — but their solutions lie almost everywhere but the border itself.
March’s total of more than 100,000 illegal immigrants nabbed at the border — and predictions of as many as 150,000 this month — have changed that.
Yet what is absent from Democrats’ suggestions is any overlap with Mr. Trump, for whom the crisis is all about the border.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said this weekend that he would write legislation to deal with loopholes that serve to deliver footholds to illegal immigrants.
About two-thirds of the illegal immigrants caught by the Border Patrol last month were children and families, almost all of them from Central American countries.
