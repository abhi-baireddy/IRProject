Michael Cohen released his opening remarks for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Tuesday night, saying Donald Trump, essentially, had lied for years to the American people.
“In fact, he did the opposite.”Cohen reiterated his regret for lying to Congress about his work with President Trump.
“I regret the day I said “yes” to Mr. Trump.
“To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,” Cohen says.
Lastly, Cohen talks about a check President Trump signed to pay Stephanie Clifford as a hush payment about their interactions.
