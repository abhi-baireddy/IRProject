The UK government is being sued for approving a large new gas-fired power plant, overruling the climate change objections of its own planning authority.
The world’s nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.
It said the new gas plant would be “capable” of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future.
The UK has already approved more than 15GW of large-scale gas plants, it said, so approving Drax’s project would take this to three times the government’s estimates.
The planning inspectorate also concluded that wind and solar power would cut payers’ bills, while the proposed gas plant would not.
