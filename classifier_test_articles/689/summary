Despite President Donald Trump's claims that there would “never be a Republican elected in this country again” if there was a universal vote-by-mail system in place, a new study suggests neither party would have an advantage.
A study from Stanford University’s Democracy and Polarization Lab released Wednesday indicates a vote-by-mail option doesn’t benefit either major political party, The Hill reports.
Opponents to voting-by-mail argue it disadvantages their political party and will increase voter fraud.
Researchers compared results in counties that adopted a vote-by-mail program to those within the same state that did not.
The study compared county-level election results and public party registration data for voters in Utah and California from 1996-2018.
