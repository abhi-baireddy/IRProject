WASHINGTON – Republican Sen. Mitt Romney criticized President Donald Trump for a series of attacks he made against the late Sen. John McCain, who Romney called an "honorable" and "courageous" man.
"I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God," Romney wrote on Twitter.

"I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,” Trump told reporters at the White House, answering a question before a meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Just before being sworn into office in January, Romney wrote in an opinion piece that Trump had "not risen to the mantle of the office."
