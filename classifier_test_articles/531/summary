The Trump administration on Tuesday announced its rule to replace the “unachievable” Obama gas mileage and emissions standards.
The Department of Transportation’s (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule.
The Trump SAFE rule would increase the CAFE and CO2 emissions standards by 1.5 percent each year through 2026, which runs in stark contrast to the Obama rule of five percent annual increases.
Wheeler said that the SAFE rule will “remove and replace” the “undue regulatory” Obama emissions standards into one simple national program.
The Trump rule runs counter to the Obama fuel emissions program, which allowed California to set its own, more stringent fuel standards.
