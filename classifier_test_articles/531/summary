This week: All about a coronavirus vaccine … Bye bye, Bernie ...
Here, we’ve summarized a discussion of coronavirus vaccine research with two researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine: Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, and Wilbur Chen, an adult infectious disease expert with the same center.
The first U.S. clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine began in March, meaning they were up and running just a couple of months after the virus was detected — an unusually quick start.
For coronavirus, creating a new vaccine could end up taking 12 to 18 months, or possibly shorter, Neuzil said.
