The Muslim community of Canterbury, the province home to Christchurch, is tiny and close-knit.
They number just 3,000, according to Toshi Hodliffe, of the Canterbury Muslim Community Trust, in a country of about 50,000 Muslims.
“When you’re living in New Zealand,” Jaballah says, “you always feel safe.
You know, we’ve got 50 people to bury.”And dread, he said, has now overtaken the local Muslim community.
For both Jaballah and Hodliffe, imagining how Christchurch’s Muslim community will heal is still impossible.
