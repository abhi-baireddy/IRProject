A showman to the last, Mr Nazarbayev signed his resignation decree on live television.
Mr Tokayev immediately ordered Astana, the vainglorious capital Mr Nazarbayev founded, rechristened “Nursultan” in his honour.
By securing Kazakhstan’s independence, Mr Nazarbayev literally put it on the map, as he pointed out in his resignation speech.
Mr Nazarbayev did not name a preferred candidate, but it seems inconceivable that he does not have one in mind.
Presumably, Mr Nazarbayev does not intend a big political opening, or he would have started one while still in office himself.
