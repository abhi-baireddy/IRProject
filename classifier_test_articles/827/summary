Knowing that he could be arrested at any time, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza and his lawyer moved quickly to prepare documents to halt the deportation.
But before the papers were filed, immigration agents arrested Mr. Gonzalez Carranza on April 8, pulling him over as he was driving to work.
Mr. Gonzalez Carranza remained in the United States without permanent legal status, sharing custody of his daughter with his wife’s parents.
His wife’s military service should have allowed him to remain in the country legally until April 20, 2019.
He slept at a migrant shelter, mostly filled with people waiting to seek asylum in the United States.
