A parody Twitter account purporting to be owned by an unhappy cow living on one of Rep. Devin Nunes’ Iowa farms attacked the California Republican as a “treasonous cowpoke” and “udder-ly worthless” during the 2018 campaign.
Most politicians and celebrities today face similar parody accounts.
A Twitter account called @Betosblog lampoons Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rouke.
As part of the suit, Nunes wants Twitter to disclose the real names of the people who created the parody accounts.
The company has denied a political bias but has not commented specifically on Nunes’ suit.
