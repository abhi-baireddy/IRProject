The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump's name will appear on every mailed stimulus check, a move that senior IRS officials said would delay at least the first round of paper checks.
The Treasury will print "President Donald J.Trump" on the memo line of every paper check, because only career Treasury Department officials can legally sign the checks, The Washington Post first reported.
Trump pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to let him sign the checks "for weeks," The Washington Post reported, but only career Treasury officials can legally sign the checks.
The Treasury decided to print "President Donald J. Trump" below the words "Economic Impact Payment" on the memo line of every mailed check.
