The court’s liberals appear increasingly worried that the mandatory-detention law itself is unconstitutional.
The amount of money currently spent on arrests, detention, and deportation of immigrants was hardly conceivable then.
As immigration enforcement has ramped up generally, immigrants with old criminal convictions — including legal immigrants, even green card holders — have become especially appealing targets.
Meanwhile, the backlog in immigration courts means that waits for a hearing, even for detained immigrants, can take a much longer time than they did in 1996.
The Supreme Court’s liberals think that Tuesday’s ruling did the opposite: It said that the law required a policy that seems obviously unconstitutional to them.
