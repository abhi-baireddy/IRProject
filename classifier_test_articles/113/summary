** The “N” rating relates to the percentage of particles of at least 0.3 microns in diameter that the mask is designed to block: N95 masks stop 95% and N99 masks stop 99%.
** Masks are only effective if you combine wearing them with frequent handwashing and ensure you don’t touch your face.
** The mask should cover your mouth and nose, and there should be no gaps between your face and the mask.
