While in Vietnam in negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, it seems to be a good time for Trump to focus and stay away from social media. Of course, that isn’t going to happen, especially not with Michael Cohen’s upcoming testimony to the House Oversight Committee.

Cohen has been disbarred and that’s one of the few provable facts Trump can offer. However, Cohen can also prove a few things and has the receipts. He’ll offer testimony in front of a congressional committee and has already pleaded guilty to lying to them once. He was sentenced for that and is about to serve three years in prison. No one believes he’d take a chance on lying to them again. He’ll bring proof of his claims, and his claims will reportedly be explosive.

As for Trump’s claims that Cohen’s crimes had nothing to do with his work for Trump, that is also a lie. Cohen has tapes, tapes that everyone has already heard, of Trump directing him to commit one of the felonies that Cohen has been charged with: campaign finance violations related to the hush money paid to adult film star and Trump mistress, Stormy Daniels.

No one is buying yet another lie from Trump about the manufacturing industry growing in the United States because it’s already been proven that it hasn’t. What’s more, his insults directed at Sen. Blumenthal are laughably ironic. Blumenthal served in the military even if he wasn’t deployed to Vietnam (and never claimed that he was) and Trump’s father paid a doctor to say Trump had bone spurs to get him out of the draft.

Twitter is well aware of Trump’s utter dishonesty and ridiculousness. Read some of their comments below:
