While in Vietnam in negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, it seems to be a good time for Trump to focus and stay away from social media.
Of course, that isn’t going to happen, especially not with Michael Cohen’s upcoming testimony to the House Oversight Committee.
Cohen has been disbarred and that’s one of the few provable facts Trump can offer.
He’ll offer testimony in front of a congressional committee and has already pleaded guilty to lying to them once.
As for Trump’s claims that Cohen’s crimes had nothing to do with his work for Trump, that is also a lie.
