North Korean media only report what Kim wants them to report.
In 2013 Kim announced North Korea would simultaneously build its nuclear capability and develop its economy.
At the April Inter-Korean summit, Kim became the first North Korean leader to enter South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953.
President Trump is using the Vietnam summit to test whether Kim is ready to take serious steps toward denuclearization.
CIA leadership analysts will be eagerly awaiting the president’s assessment of Kim’s reactions.
