A New Jersey man who allegedly coughed on a Wegmans employee and said he had coronavirus was charged Tuesday with a terroristic threat, among other charges, officials said.
On Sunday, a Wegmans employee reportedly asked Falcone to step back after he was “standing too close to her” and an open display of prepared food.
ADVERTISEMENTFalcone allegedly leaned forward within three feet of her and purposefully coughed, while laughing and saying he was infected with the virus.
The man reportedly did not cooperate with police until after about 40 minutes when he provided his name, according to the attorney general's office.
New Jersey has recorded 3,675 positive cases in the state, causing 44 deaths, according to the state health department.
