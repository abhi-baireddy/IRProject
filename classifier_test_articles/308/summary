But with the arrest of Julian Assange this makes all of those news outlets vulnerable to state or corporate repression and censure.
After all, it was Wikileaks that exposed the war crimes of the Bush administration in Iraq, not the corporate media.
Indeed fascist leaders around the world, along with the military/surveillance establishment and their neoliberal enablers, are celebrating the silencing of Assange.
Thanks to the continued proliferation of nuclear arms, endless corporate and military assaults on the life sustaining biosphere, catastrophic climate change and the systematic dismantling of democracy, it is a land uncharted.
But the arrest of Assange is representative of a free press now under constant threat of annihilation.
