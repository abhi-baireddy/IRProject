The new penalty adds to Google’s costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion citing antitrust violations.
In 2018, Vestager took aim at the company’s Android smartphone operating system, saying Google pressured mobile device-makers to pre-install the tech giant’s apps.
A year before that, Vestager punished Google for giving its shopping-comparison service a better placement in search results over rivals’ offerings.
In both cases, Google has started tweaking its business practices in Europe to comply with the law while appealing the E.U.
Regulators recently have started scrutinizing Google’s handling of local search results, following a complaint brought by Yelp last year.
