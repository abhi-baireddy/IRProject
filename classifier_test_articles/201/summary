The Trump administration plans to resume federal executions, reversing a 16-year de facto moratorium on the death penalty within the Department of Justice.
The federal government has carried out three executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1988: two in 2001 and one in 2003.
Only 25 states still have the death penalty on the books, but just eight states carried out executions in 2018.
So far this year, governors in four states — California, Colorado, Oregon and Pennsylvania — have placed moratoriums on their state’s death penalty.
New Hampshire also abolished the death penalty entirely in 2019, just months after Washington, which scrapped capital punishment last October.
