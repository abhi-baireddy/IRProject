An off-duty pilot riding in the cockpit of a Boeing 737 Max 8 fixed a malfunction on the second-to-the-last flight for the aircraft before same plane crashed during a different flight in the Java Sea the next day, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday evening.
The pilot reportedly advised the crew to kill the power to a motor that was pointing the aircraft's nose downward.
That same system is under intense scrutiny as authorities continue to investigate another crash involving the 737 Max.
The same plane, which was being operated by a separate crew, crashed into the Java Sea near Indonesia the next day, on October 29, 2018.
After the crash, other countries grounded the 737 Max aircraft, including China, which has the most number of 737s.
