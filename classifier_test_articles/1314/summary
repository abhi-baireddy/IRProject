Though Osama bin Laden, the group’s founder, had long railed against “Jews and Crusaders”, so giving a religious sectarian dimension to his global jihad, his central target was clear: “kill the Americans and their allies”.
This reflects a broader trend in terrorism directed against religious targets.
“Once you have done that it’s easy to slaughter them en masse.”Al-Qaeda itself has not been averse to acts against religious targets, such as the bombing of a synagogue in Djerba, in Tunisia, in 2002.
Al-Qaeda’s “far enemy” strategy is hampered by the fact that it has become harder for it to hit American targets.
The latest bombings suggest that religious sites in all countries, even those with little history of anti-Christian attacks such as Sri Lanka, have become fair game for jihadists.
