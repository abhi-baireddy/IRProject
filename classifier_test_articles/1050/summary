WASHINGTON -- The House voted 245-182 this evening, with 13 Republicans joining the majority Dems, to block President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to raid other appropriations for money to build a border wall.
"I’m 100% in favor of President Trump’s wall, and today’s vote had nothing to do with the need to build it.
Once in the Senate, four Republican defectors would be needed to send the bill to President Trump's desk.
There is no basis in law or in fact to declare a national emergency.
That is why House Democrats are proceeding with a resolution of this approval with respect to this fake national emergency."
