LGBTQ leaders and feminists have also put forward the idea of stating preferred pronouns on email signatures.
Scientific American cites several studies to underline its point, such as women with feminine names on their resumes being less likely to earn a job.

The Scientific American article does not even address how this will be socially enforced, which may be through the shame and hectoring of more traditionally-minded people as backward-thinking bigots who wish to oppress women.
In fact, by characterizing the use of traditional pronouns as oppressive, Scientific American has already laid the groundwork for that social reality, which has already arrived in some quarters.
