Economic depression and unemployment can be overcome, but a massive loss of American civil liberties might be tough to unwind, according to economist Ben Stein on Newsmax TV.
"I fear that A. we're headed toward depression and B. loss of our civil liberties in a very big way and it's going to hard to get them back," Stein told Wednesday's "Greg Kelly Reports."
Stein, a famed speech writer for Richard Nixon, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" actor, and noted economist told host Greg Kelly, "we've already saw we're in the beginning phase of a depression."
We are not headed for a long-term economic depression, he added.
"We're way, way better prepared than we were during the Great Depression, there's no comparison," Stein concluded.
