House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she will form a bipartisan select committee on the coronavirus crisis to oversee the spending of $2 trillion that Congress has approved to respond to the pandemic.
Nonetheless she hoped to work on the fourth measure together with Republicans, despite skepticism expressed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Pelosi said she spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday evening about tax matters, but "they know that I want to go forward" on infrastructure spending.
But House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said that a select committee could not be created without a vote and he does not know when that would be.
"We want to make sure there are not exploiters out there...Where there is money there is also frequently mischief."
