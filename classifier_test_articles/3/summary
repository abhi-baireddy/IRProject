Facebook agrees to hide demographics from landlords, creditors looking to advertise Landlords will no longer be able to target ads to certain demographicsannounced Tuesday that it will block landlords and creditors from using a person's demographic data including a person’s zip code, gender and age, to target certain groups in online advertisements.
The announcement is part of a legal settlement with groups that promote fair housing laws.
They complained in court last year that the social media giant enabled real estate brokers and landlords to exclude certain demographics when advertising.
Under the new rules, a company looking to run housing, employment or credit ads also won’t be able to target Facebook members based on age, gender or zip code.
And, Facebook said it was also building a tool that would let people search for all housing ads in the U.S. regardless of whether the ads are shown.
