Charles Harder, the celebrity attorney famous for the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that brought down Gawker, is now representing Donald Trump in the latest lawsuit filed by a sexual-misconduct accuser against the president, The Daily Beast has learned.
After publication of his scorched-earth remarks about the Trump family in Michael Wolff’s book Fire & Fury, Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon received a letter from Harder threatening legal action.
Harder also repped the late Roger Ailes, an informal Trump adviser, during the former Fox News chief’s sexual-harassment scandal.
Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker was underwritten by Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a prominent ally of Donald Trump’s.
The White House has maintained the various accusers are all simply lying.
