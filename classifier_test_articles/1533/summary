I did better in the presidential race than today on the golf course!‚Äù Graham tweeted in October 2017.
Graham offers an explanation of sorts in a weirdly candid interview with swamp chronicler Mark Leibovich for The New York Times Magazine.
For one, Graham says he has a duty to his constituents to advance Republican policy, and Donald Trump is a Republican president.
More important, Graham argues, his close friendship with Trump has allowed him to influence the president on such topics as Syria (where Trump has agitated to remove all U.S. troops) and Venezuela.
During the Republican primary, the majority of the Washington Establishment rejected Trump and Trumpism.
