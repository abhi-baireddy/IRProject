It seems another outbreak of wistfulness for the presidency of George W. Bush is upon us.
"He and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism," Reid said of Bush in a CNN interview.
President Trump, on the other hand, makes Reid miss having Bush in the Oval Office "every day."
But in many ways, Trump's presidency merely amplifies the worst tendencies of the Bush administration.
All of us should be hoping it's not too long before Trump joins Bush in retirement.
