In the encounter, a Pakistani aircraft was shot down by an Indian fighter jet, New Delhi said, a claim that Pakistan denied.
In Pakistan, with the capture of the Indian pilot, the current crisis has shored up support for Mr. Khan, who took office six months ago and has since faced growing opposition domestically.
The crisis has not presented such an opportunity for Mr. Modi, who seemed destined just a year ago to clinch a second term as Indiaâ€™s prime minister.
Since then, Mr. Modi has faced considerable opposition over what critics say is his mishandling of the economy ahead of the elections this spring.
The capture of the Indian pilot may only weaken his position and lead to a dangerous escalation if Mr. Modi chooses to respond militarily.
