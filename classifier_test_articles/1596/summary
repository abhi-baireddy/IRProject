WASHINGTON—Paul Manafort’s legal team detailed the former Trump campaign chairman’s work for four presidents, his ailing health, and the support he provided his extended family in a filing late Monday, asking a District of Columbia federal judge for leniency.
Manafort is not the ‘brazen’ criminal that the Special Counsel paints him to be,” the attorneys wrote, responding to a request from special counsel Robert Mueller’s office that sought a stiff punishment for the longtime political adviser.
