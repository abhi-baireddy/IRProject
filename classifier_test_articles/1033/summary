Separately, the Transportation Department confirmed that its watchdog agency will examine how the FAA certified the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, the now-grounded plane involved in two fatal accidents within five months.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao formally requested the audit in a letter sent to Inspector General Calvin Scovel III on Tuesday.
It did not mention reports that the inspector general and federal prosecutors are looking into the development and regulatory approval of the jet.
A Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia last October, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed this month near Addis Ababa.
A report in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday said the inspector general was looking into the planeâ€™s anti-stall system.
