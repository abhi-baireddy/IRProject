Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano reacted to the Harvey Weinstein verdict on “America’s Newsroom” Monday, calling it a "significant victory" for the disgraced movie producer and a "monumental setback" for prosecutors.
Weinstein, 67, was convicted of first-degree commission of a criminal sexual act and third-degree rape but was acquitted of two more serious charges of predatory sexual assault, as well as first-degree rape.
The charges Weinstein was convicted of carry a total sentence of up to 29 years in prison.
“That apparently failed, but they may have another shot at it,” Napolitano said.
The jury of seven men and five women handed down the verdict on Monday after five days of deliberating.
