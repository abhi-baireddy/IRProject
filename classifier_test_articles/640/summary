Los Angeles County health officials are investigating why six patients who had procedures at an L.A. clinic were diagnosed with hepatitis C, a liver infection that is spread through infected blood.
Most people who are infected with hepatitis C do not have any symptoms, so testing is the only way to understand the scope of the problem.
Left untreated, people with hepatitis C can go on to develop liver failure and liver cancer.
The clinic decided to close fully during the investigation, according to health officials.
