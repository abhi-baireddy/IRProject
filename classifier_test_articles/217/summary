The United States has carried out an air raid against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, a US forces spokesman said a day after President Donald Trump spoke to a senior Taliban leader by phone.
He said, however, the US was committed to peace but called on the Taliban to stop "needless attacks" and uphold their commitments.
According to Leggett, Taliban fighters had carried out 43 attacks on checkpoints in Helmand on Tuesday.
The Taliban has said it will not begin talks with the Afghan government as envisaged in the agreement until the prisoner release takes place.
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission expressed concern about the prisoner release in a letter to US officials, the Taliban and the Afghan government.
