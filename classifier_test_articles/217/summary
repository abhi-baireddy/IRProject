WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that special counsel Robert Mueller was “properly appointed,” becoming the first higher court to weigh in on the lawfulness of Mueller’s appointment and come out in his favor.
In an opinion written by Judge Judith Rogers, the court concluded that Mueller was an “inferior officer,” which meant he could be legally appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; Rosenstein appointed Mueller to run the Russia investigation in May 2017.
Miller had argued that Mueller was a “principal officer” who had to be confirmed by the US Senate.
Miller could petition the entire DC Circuit to reconsider his case, or he could petition the US Supreme Court.
The DC Circuit rejected Miller’s other arguments against Mueller’s appointment, finding that the US Supreme Court had held that Congress gave the attorney general power to appoint a special counsel.
