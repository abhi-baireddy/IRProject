David Brooks:Well, I went through a bad period in 2013.
A lot of my friendships were in the conservative movement, but I wasn't that kind of conservative anymore, so a lot of my friendships went away.

But some people get broken open.
You just realize the depths of yourself, and you realize that only spiritual and emotional food is going to fill those depths.
