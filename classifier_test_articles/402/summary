A male medical student at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School (UTSW) was expelled after his former fiancée accused him of physical assault.
She was charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to court documents.
Jane stumbled and fell, and John, according to court documents, asked if she was okay since she had previously fallen at work.
After an interview with UTSW’s associate dean for student affairs, the school decided there wasn’t enough evidence to punish John.
A month later, the school said Jane provided additional evidence, including an audio recording of the alleged incident, and that John would be expelled.
