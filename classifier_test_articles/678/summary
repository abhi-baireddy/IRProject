For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more, subscribe to Mother Jones' newslettersRight-wing Twitter provocateur Jacob Wohl was suspended from the social-media platform on Tuesday after he boasted about plans to manipulate online political discussion in a high-profile newspaper interview.
Twitter said he had violated several of the company’s rules, including creating and operating fake accounts that he used to spread misinformation and shape conversations about the 2020 elections.
A Twitter spokesperson did not specify the accounts in question, but did note that they were linked to Wohl’s own account.
The spokesperson also noted that Wohl’s comments expressing intentions to create fake accounts, made in a USA Today article published earlier Tuesday, had prompted the company to review accounts related to Wohl’s.
“There’s nothing wrong with me running left-wing properties,” he said, citing what he identifies as his First Amendment right to do so.
