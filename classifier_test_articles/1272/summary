As is often the case, TAC founding editor Patrick J. Buchanan was more than a decade ahead of the curve.
“I believe in free markets, but I do not worship them.
In the proper hierarchy of things, it is the market that must be harnessed to work for man—and not the other way around.”In practice, conservatives often have worshiped free markets.
Free markets can be corrosive of other values or priorities that are important to authentic conservatives: family, faith, and community.
Maybe conservatives will overcorrect, putting too much faith in government, even at the local level, at the expense of free markets.
