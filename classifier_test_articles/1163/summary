She pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent for Russia.
Robert Driscoll, Butina’s attorney, told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in court on Tuesday his client is ready to be sentenced.
William Hurd, an attorney for Erickson, declined to comment when asked about the prosecution’s request to delay sentencing for Butina.
Alexander Torshin, who was a deputy governor of Russia’s central bank and employed Butina as a translator and assistant, has been identified by her lawyers as a Russian official cited in court records.
