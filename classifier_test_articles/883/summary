Meet The Tea Party's New Favorite CandidateEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/APConservatives have found their candidate for one of 2016's most important Senate races: Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis.
The race sets up what could become the most important Tea Party versus establishment clash next year.
In less than three years in the House, DeSantis has staked out a conservative foothold.
National Democrats were eager to paint him as a "Tea Party extremist," calling DeSantis "wildly out of step with mainstream Floridians."
But with few open GOP primaries to play in, DeSantis will have their heavy support.
