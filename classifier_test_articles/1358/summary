A surveillance video that led to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s ensnarement in a prostitution sting at a massage parlor is set to be released to the public, prosecutors said Wednesday in court filings, citing their obligation under Florida’s public records laws.
However, a judge later in the day barred the release of any video until a 29 April hearing where he will hear from all parties, the Palm Beach Post reported.
Lawyers for the 77-year-old Kraft had asked judge Leonard Hanser not to make public the video, calling the evidence “basically pornography”.
Circuit judge Joseph Marx later ruled the release would be delayed until the hearing at the end of the month.
Prosecutors added they will “pixelate or blur depictions of obscene or pornographic images before releasing such records to the public, absent a court order”.
