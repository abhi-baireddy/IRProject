The Office of California Gov.
Gavin Newsom touted its efforts in combating the homeless crisis in the state and took shots at the Trump administration even as federal data shows it is responsible for the uptick in the U.S.'s overall homeless population.
CA is doing more than ever to tackle the homelessness crisis despite the federal administration's roadblocks:?
Homelessness in California increased by 21,306 people, or 16.4 percent, which is more than the total national increase of every other state combined.”The exchange between Newsom and Trump comes after the California governor blamed HUD for his state's homeless problem last week.
In spin room at #DemDebate, @GavinNewsom slams Trump Administration and HUD for doing “nothing” on “housing first,” the priority to solve homelessness.
