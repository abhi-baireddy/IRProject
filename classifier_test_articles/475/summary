For Africa, Chinese-Built Internet Is Better Than No Internet at AllThe Chinese telecommunications company Huawei has made huge inroads in Africa in recent years even as the United States urges its allies around the world to avoid working with the firm over cybersecurity concerns.
The construction is often accompanied by loans from Chinese state banks, which are approved faster and with fewer conditions than loans from international institutions.
While concerns about Huawei are shared by other countries around the world, in Africa they are largely overshadowed by the imperative for greater internet access.
When U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton unveiled the Trump administration’s new Africa strategy in December 2018, it was interpreted mainly as a strategy to counter China’s influence on the continent.
