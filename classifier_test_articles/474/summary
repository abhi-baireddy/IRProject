Nazarbayev Is Giving Up Presidency, Not Power, in KazakhstanASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people.
In announcing his resignation, Nazarbayev again appears to be getting out in front of popular anger over Kazakhstan’s dimming domestic future.
“An era closes today for Kazakhstan,” said Luca Anceschi, a Central Asia expert at the University of Glasgow.
Nazarbayev also has good relations with Washington and was invited to the White House by U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2018.
The new country was the world’s ninth largest and was rich with oil reserves, but Kazakhstan also inherited a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union.
