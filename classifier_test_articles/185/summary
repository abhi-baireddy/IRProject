KAMALA HARRIS: I think there has to be some form of reparations.
We can discuss what that is, but look, weâ€™re looking at more than 200 years of slavery.
THE ROOT: And as president, you would be willing to lead a conversation about what reparations for black people would look like?
KAMALA HARRIS: Yeah, including things like what we should be doing to take very seriously undiagnosed and untreated trauma.
What kind of resources are we going to put in communities to help folks heal and be on an equal footing?
