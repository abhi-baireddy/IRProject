Attorney General William Barr has unilaterally revoked the right of asylum seekers who enter the US illegally to ask an immigration judge for release on bond.
Asylum seekers who crossed illegally had two options for release.
In 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals, part of the immigration court system within the Department of Justice â€” ruled that asylum seekers had a right to both bond and parole.
Asylum officers are currently doing nearly 10,000 screening interviews a month, and nearly 90 percent of those asylum seekers pass.
Barr might have more power than whoever Trump nominates to replace purged Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
