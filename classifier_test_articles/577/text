In the midst of the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee’s new investigation into President Donald Trump, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) is calling out Democrats’ “end game” — to impeach Trump.

Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) is leading the investigation of requesting documents from 81 entities, looking into Trump’s campaign, business, and administration.

GOP Scalise swiped back at House Democrats seeking to dig up information on Trump.

“They don’t want to get the facts,” Scalise said on Fox News. “They first want to know what their end game is — their end game is to impeach the president, whether or not the facts back it up.”

Scalise added that the investigation is “beyond a witch hunt” and accused the House Democrats of trying to find “any excuse to go and appease their base who wants the president impeached.”

The investigation revealed on Monday by Nadler will look into possible obstruction of justice, public corruption, and abuses of power by the president, according to Nadler’s statement.

“President Trump has evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical, and constitutional rules and norms,” Nadler said.

“Congress must provide a check on abuses of power,” he added. “Equally, we must protect and respect the work of Special Counsel Mueller, but we cannot rely on others to do the investigative work for us.”

The investigation drew criticism from both White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the president himself, who called Democrats “stone cold CRAZY” for it.
