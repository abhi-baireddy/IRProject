Mark Harris, the Republican candidate in the North Carolina congressional election that gained national election for allegations of election fraud, announced Tuesday that he would not run in the do-over election in the district.
In a recent hearing before the North Carolina State Board of Election, Harris said he’d suffered a severe infection and two strokes in January.
Harris did not mention the election fraud allegations that plagued his campaign, but did endorse Union County Commissioner Stony Rushing in the next election.
Harris’ Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, has said he will run in the do-over election.
A grand jury will now determine whether to bring charges against anyone involved in the election fraud scandal.
