Finally accepted!
Kate Middleton has been a part of the royal family since 2011, but on Tuesday, March 19, she made her first-ever solo appearance with Queen Elizabeth — a whopping eight years after marrying Prince William!
The Duchess of Sussex has stepped out with the Queen before, but other royal family members have always been in attendance.
Oddly enough, though, Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, already her first solo appearance with the British monarch long before Kate — and after just a few months as an official royal family member!
Cue the royal drama…Click through the gallery above for the new photos!
