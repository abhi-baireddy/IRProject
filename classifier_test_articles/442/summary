Workers in many industrialized countries pay more in taxes than Americans do, but those workers also receive more benefits in exchange – benefits that American workers pay for separately.
As a result, comparisons of tax rates across countries can be misleading, since they fail to capture payments made for similar benefits.
The most important difference centers on health care, which most Americans pay for privately, along with their employers.
“American workers already pay more than enough money to provide good health care to everyone in the country.
It’s just that they pay it into a private insurance system that wastes large portions of it on rents and administrative redundancy.”
