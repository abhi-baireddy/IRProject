But much less well-known are the decisive battles of March 1919, when a nationwide general strike called for the socialization of heavy industry and the anchoring of workers’ councils in the German constitution.
Yet its failure owed, more than anything, to deep-rooted contradictions within the workers’ movement itself.
Officially, the country was now a “socialist republic” governed by a Workers’ Council.
The council movement was “learning by doing” — going from practice to theory, and not the other way around.
By Christmas 1918 the overwhelming majority of World War I conscripts had gone home — the soldiers’ council movement collapsed overnight.
