On the morning of March 4, Christian communities in three villages in Benue State in northern Nigeria were attacked by Muslim Fulani militants.
As a result, the world’s TV viewers were left knowing nothing about the massacres in Africa, in contrast to the worldwide attention given to the massacres in New Zealand.
One factor must be the different levels of accessibility to such events by the world’s media.
Hence the level of media coverage of the New Zealand tragedy, compared with the almost complete noncoverage of the tragedies in northern Nigeria.
Hard questions should be asked why the world’s media is so much more interested in a massacre of Muslims in New Zealand than ongoing massacres of Christians in Africa.
