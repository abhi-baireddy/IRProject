U.S. National Security Advisor, John Bolton, meets with journalists during a visit to London, England, August 12, 2019.
(Peter Nicholls/Reuters)Former White House national security adviser John Bolton announced Monday that he would be willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial against President Trump should he be subpoenaed.
â€œThe House has concluded its Constitutional responsibility by adopting Articles of Impeachment related to the Ukraine matter.
The Republican majority in the Senate is not currently planning to call on Bolton to testify in the upcoming trial.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far shown no appetite to negotiate with Democrats on the trial process, however.
