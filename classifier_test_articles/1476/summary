I speak, of course, of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mitch McConnell is valuable because he teaches us in graphic fashion how not to be.
If Donald Trump is the Devil waiting at that moonlit crossroads, Mitch McConnell drove him there and paid for the gas.
Mitch McConnell is a highly visible champion of that ideological deception, a deft practitioner of that stagecraft.
And therein lies the rub, because Mitch McConnell was absolutely correct.
