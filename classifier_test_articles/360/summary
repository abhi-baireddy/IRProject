White nationalist violence is escalating rapidly, both in the United States and elsewhereAfter a white nationalism-espousing terrorist killed 50 people in two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques, the current American administration has largely clammed up, offering only rote sympathy to the victims and proposing, of course, absolutely nothing that might prevent future far-right terrorist acts.
That leaves the House, which conveniently is now under the control of a party that does not have to hedge its statements on violent white nationalism for fear of upsetting a conservative white nationalist base.
Erin Banco and Sam Stein report that House Judiciary Committee Democrats will be reigniting a much-needed discussion of far-right extremism by holding the first hearing in years on the violent white nationalist movement.
Republicans have blocked and belittled further efforts to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute far-right extremists ever since, all under the same apparent belief that investigating violent far-right groups would infringe too conspicuously on their own base.
That will likely continue, but House Democrats are not as likely to go along with the Republican efforts as they were 10 years and many terrorist attacks ago.
