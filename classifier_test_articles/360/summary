President Trump and Barack Obama are locked in a dead heat as 2019’s most admired man, according to a new study that underscores the political divide in America.
The Gallup poll, conducted each year since 1948, asked Americans to name which man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most.
Of the people surveyed between Dec. 2 and 15, 18 percent of respondents named both Obama and Trump.
For the second year in a row, Michelle Obama was named the most admired woman in America.
According to Gallup, the sitting president is typically Americans’ choice for most admired man, taking the honor in 58 of the 72 prior polls.
