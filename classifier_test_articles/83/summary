On Tuesday, March 19, 2019, a New York City councilman accused the company of putting tenants in danger by allowing several of its building to avoid safety inspections.
“The goal here is a concerted campaign to evade scrutiny,” said Torres at a news conference outside the Kushner Cos. headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue.
The Kushner Cos. said that the problems with the certificates stretch back to its previous owners.
The Kushner Cos. has said that the paperwork was handled by another firm and mistakes were corrected when they came to its notice.
He still owns stake in Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties.
