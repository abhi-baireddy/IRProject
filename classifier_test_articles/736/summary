Goins claims that during the shindig in Los Angeles, Cosby had drugged and raped her.
The actor, who has been an AIG policyholder for more than two decades, slammed the insurer.
“AIG’s conduct is ‘despicable’ and I can only imagine how terribly they’re treating their policyholders who don’t have my means and my resources,” fumed Cosby in the statement.
Radar Online previously reported that Cosby’s team had filed to bifurcate his statute-of-limitations defense in March.
Goins previously did not file any complaints against Cosby until 2015, after the statute of limitations had expired.
