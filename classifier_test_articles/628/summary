The Justice Department said Friday it will not pursue criminal charges against former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, after a nearly two-year-long investigation into accusations brought by the agency's independent watchdog who found that he lacked "candor" when questioned about leaking to the media.
“The added insult and suspicion that comes with being under criminal investigation just made the entire experience a million times worse.”McCabe said he’s glad the DOJ “finally decided to do the right thing” but blasted the lengthy process.
The announcement Friday comes at the end of a dramatic week at the Justice Department relating to the case of former Trump associate Roger Stone.
The Journal's account of the call said a senior Justice Department official expressed displeasure to McCabe that FBI agents were still looking into the Clinton Foundation, and that McCabe had defended the agent's authority to pursue the issue.
Throughout the investigation, McCabe denied any wrongdoing and said the inspector general’s conclusions relied on mischaracterizations and omissions, including of information favorable to McCabe.
