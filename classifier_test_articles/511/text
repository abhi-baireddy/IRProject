China was the United States’ third-ranked source of imports in February, its lowest ranking since February 2004, or 180 months.

Until February, China had not even slipped into the No. 2 ranking in almost 12 years except on two occasions, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released today.

The data released today is but the first chapter in the developing story on the impact of the fast-moving coronavirus outbreak on U.S. trade and, more specifically, U.S.-China trade.

But, it’s important to note that February data measures not the cratering U.S. economy, which received more bad news today on unemployment claims. The U.S. economy was solid in February.

Rather, it measures the degree to which Chinese manufacturing was brought to a standstill by the outbreak of coronavirus on the tail end of the Chinese New Year.

The weakening U.S. economy won’t start to reveal itself in trade data until the release of the March data, about one month from now, and it will almost certainly begin showing declines in trade not just with China but with other leading trade partners.

For the month of February, U.S. imports from China fell 31.45% from January and 31.27% from the previous February.

The total, $22.81 billion, was below the $29.08 billion from Mexico and $24.35 billion from Canada. In October, Chinese imports stood at $40.15 billion. That is a 43.17% decline in just four months.

U.S. exports to China also tumbled in February, to the lowest total since May 2010, or 141 months.

The total, $6.82 billion, was off 5.55% from January and down 19.19% from the previous February.

The dollar declines between exports and imports are more significant than the percentages might suggest, given the imbalance in the trading relationship.

U.S. exports to China were down $400.27 million from January while U.S. imports from China were down $10.47 billion.

On the import side, the biggest declines were seen in the imports of technology:

Cell phones and related equipment, down 49.61% from the previous month and 71.88% from just four months ago.

Computers, down 45.91% from January, 68.36% from four months ago.

Computer parts, down 36.29% from the previous month.

The category that includes both TVs and computer monitors, off 34.79% from January and 63.52% from a year ago.

U.S.-China trade had already been suffering under the weight of a trade war, with China falling from ranking as the United States top trade partner to No. 3 in 2019.
