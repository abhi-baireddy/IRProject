(Mike Blake/Reuters)Joe Biden on Friday stumbled through an interview on his proposed response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Following a long and disjointed introduction, Biden appeared to suggest policy proposals similar to those Franklin D. Roosevelt employed to coordinate manufacturing for the war effort in the 1940’s.
Cuomo’s favorability ratings shot up in his home state as he dealt with the pandemic, however he has denied that he has any intention of challenging Biden.
Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) dropped out of the race after weeks of speculation following a string of Biden primary victories and endorsed the former vice president several days later.
