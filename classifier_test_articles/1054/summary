Obama would be their perfect candidate in 2020, of course, but he can't run again because of that pesky 22nd Amendment.
Callum Patton, Newsweek:A giant earth artwork depicting 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto Oâ€™Rourke has appeared north of Austin, Texas.
If Perry had been running for president as a Democrat, the press would've dismissed that story quicker than Beto's DWI.
And just as with Obama, all of Beto's odd behavior and disconcerting foibles will just become part of the myth.
I also don't like it when Republicans worship Trump, or any other politician.
