Top Trump administration officials are in discussions to reassign deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates to the Department of Energy from the National Security Council, per two sources familiar with the planning.
A decision on such a personnel move has not been finalized and discussions could still fall apart, one source tells Axios.
"We do not comment on personnel matters," National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot told Axios.
Coates was an original member of Trump's national security team, having been brought in during the transition by Trump's first NSA, Michael Flynn.
Don't forget: Coates has strong working and personal ties to the Energy Department.
