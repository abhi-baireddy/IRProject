Pope Francis used an Easter message to advocate for a socialist "universal basic wage."
Writing to the leaders of social movements across the globe, Francis said universal basic income, something that only far-left American politicians support, would achieve an "ideal."
"This may be the time to consider a universal basic wage which would acknowledge and dignify the noble, essential tasks you carry out," Francis wrote.
Francis was addressing the great needs of these communities, and those who serve them, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, despite advocating for UBI, Francis said that state-based and market-based solutions will not be ultimately sufficient.
