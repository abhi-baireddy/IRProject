SHOW TRANSCRIPTSenior White House adviser Jared Kushner says the U.S. will unveil its long-awaited peace proposal for the Middle East after Ramadan ends in June.
President Donald Trump's son-in-law made the comments during a live interview for Time magazine's 100 Summit.
Kushner said the two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians isn't working and that the U.S. peace plan will demand "tough compromises" from both parties.
Instead, the U.S. plan will involve coming up with a solution first, then figuring out a process to reach that solution.
