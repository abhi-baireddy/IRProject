Left-wing activist group Women’s March on Tuesday used Friday’s terrorist attack on a New Zealand mosque that killed 50 people to solicit donations from supporters.
Women’s March sent out a fundraising email from co-chair Linda Sarsour, who asked supporters to “give the gift of justice” by donating to the activist organization she leads.
They were inspired and radicalized by the xenophobic and hateful rhetoric of Trump and his administration,” Sarsour continued.
Sarsour then asked supporters to “give the gift of justice” by donating to Women’s March.
Women’s March did not return an email seeking comment on the fundraising email.
