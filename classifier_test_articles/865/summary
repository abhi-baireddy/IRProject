He went home to West Virginia to speak and was introduced in West Virginia, his home state, as the speaker of the House.
So he convinced some of the recalcitrant members, they did a vote and C-Span went on in June of 1986.
C-Span has given politicians a platform to connect directly with their constituents, but now they can do that on social media.
It also means that people on social media or late-night comedians have immediate access to this.
I think most people who are in their 20s or younger, if they have an experience with C-Span it is through social media, it is through the late-night comedians.
