U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask Brussels to delay Britain’s scheduled exit from the European Union, despite senior EU officials casting doubts over whether an extension to the timetable can be agreed.
Ministers expect the Prime Minister to ask for the planned Brexit date to be moved out to June 30, with an option of requesting a longer delay left on the table.
Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, raised concerns on Tuesday about the delay.
The Prime Minister canvassed opinion from cabinet on a Brexit delay on Tuesday evening, once again exposing the stark divisions within her senior leadership team.
May sought to schedule a third vote on her revised Brexit deal this week, after it was rejected for a second time by 149 votes.
