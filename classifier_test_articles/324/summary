Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has declared his intention to challenge Donald Trump for the Republican 2020 nomination.
"It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag.
"I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run," he told Tapper.
Weld also said he will not run as an Independent if he does not win the Republican nomination.
That's a pity, because Republicans have already rigged the primaries in such a way as to guarantee Trump the nomination.
