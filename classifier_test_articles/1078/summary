Last night, residents of Toledo, Ohio voted in favor of a major breakthrough for the “Rights of Nature” movement.
Recognizing legally-enforceable rights for the natural world, the Lake Erie Bill of Rights passed with 61.4 percent of the vote.
“An Ohio city will vote on whether Lake Erie has the same rights as a person,” read the CNN headline.
Beginning today, with this historic vote, the people of Toledo and our allies are ushering in a new era of environmental rights by securing the rights of the Great Lake Erie.”The amendment recognizes rights to “exist, flourish, and naturally evolve” for Lake Erie, and rights to a “clean and healthy Lake Erie and Lake Erie ecosystem” for residents of Toledo.
