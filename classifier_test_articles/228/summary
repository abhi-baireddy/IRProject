Cheri Marchionda, a mother of three, was sexually assaulted in her hotel room while traveling for work in 2014.
According to court documents, her assailant got a key to her room from hotel staff without any security checks.
"The court ultimately ruled that as the guest room key control, Embassy Suites and Hilton did not have ultimate responsibility," Villari said.
Women's rights attorney Gloria Allred has represented several hotel assault victims, including Kayla Snipe who was raped in her hotel room in 2015.
Also, request only one room key so you always know where it is.
