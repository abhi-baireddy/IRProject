“Hey @MichaelCohen212,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, wrote on Twitter.
Cohen previously postponed his congressional testimony, originally slated for Feb. 7, due to numerous threats against him and his family.
Former Director of United States Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub replied to Gaetz’s tweet with a link to the federal witness tampering statute.
But Gaetz shrugged off any suggestion that he was “witness tampering.” “I’m witness testing,” he told Vox’s Alex Ward.
Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have both made statements about Cohen’s family that could be seen as witness tampering, former prosecutors have told VICE News.
