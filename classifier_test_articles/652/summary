The DNC moved the debate from its scheduled location in Arizona to CNN’s studio in Washington, D.C. last week amid coronavirus fears.
The only people present in the room were Biden, Sanders, and moderators Dana Bash, Ilia Calderon and Jake Tapper.
The night was a sharp departure from the previous debate, highlighted by moderators losing complete control of the participants.
Sanders asked Biden to disavow his Super PAC, while Biden claimed Sanders had nine PACs funding his campaign.
“The praising of Cuba, the praising just now of China – China is an authoritarian dictatorship,” Biden noted.
