As Reason's Ron Bailey has noted, a similar plan outlined in 2015 would have cost roughly $7 trillion, while a previous version of that proposal might have cost up to $13 trillion.
Doing so would cost between $1.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion, the AAF estimates.
Including them "would increase the cost to $3.8 trillion in 2019, $44.6 trillion between 2020 and 2029," the AAF says.
The report also estimates that providing universal health care "will cost roughly $36 trillion between 2020 and 2029."
Simply housing the homeless could cost under $12 billion, AAF estimates, citing Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data.
