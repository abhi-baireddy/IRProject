Further distancing herself from her professional prosecutorial past, the supposed feminist Kamala Harris now supports decriminalizing sex work.
Speaking with The Root, the senator from California said she supports the decriminalization of sex work, while adding a few additional qualifiers.
“But when you’re talking about consenting adults, we should consider that we can’t criminalize consensual behavior.”According to HuffPost, Harris’ comments are in response to the sex worker community accusing her of conflating sex work with sex trafficking.
“There are lots of good reasons to root for Kamala Harris,” wrote Melissa Petro, a former sex worker, in The Establishment in 2017.
“What this has done is move the sex trade further underground and make sex work more dangerous.”Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, told HuffPost that Kamala Harris’ supposed shift on the decriminalization of sex workers is an empty promise.
