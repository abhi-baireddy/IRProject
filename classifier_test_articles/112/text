San Francisco prosecutors said Monday they have moved to expunge more than 9,300 marijuana-related convictions from people’s records dating back to 1975.

Why it matters: This comes more than two years after California legalized recreational marijuana, clearing the way for expungement or re-sentencing for those with marijuana-related convictions. District Attorney George Gascón said San Francisco is the first city in the country to clear eligible pot convictions, and he will soon present the cases to a judge for final approval.
