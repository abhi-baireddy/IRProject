The stay-at-home orders are government overreach, the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says, and the labeling of some workers as “essential” arbitrary.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It enrages something inside of you,” said Ackison, who was among those who protested Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son. She has “no fear whatsoever” of contracting <a class="" href="/UnderstandingtheOutbreak">the virus</a><!-- -->, she said Thursday, dismissing it as hype.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Ohio protest was among a growing number staged outside governors’ mansions and state Capitols across the country. In places like Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, small-government groups, supporters of President Donald Trump, anti-vaccine advocates, gun rights backers and supporters of right-wing causes have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As their frustration with life under lockdown grows, they’ve defied social distancing rules <a class="" href="/57f673f31fb343042e3806b9806e8f7d">in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them.</a></p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="/></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-VTpET5EmTDs-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/VTpET5EmTDs/0.jpg" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"/></div></div></div><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Some protests have been small, promoted via Facebook groups that popped up in recent days and whose organizers are sometimes difficult to identify. Others are backed by groups funded by Republican donors, some with ties to Trump. The largest so far, <a class="" href="/098496d0ade7c499110dc2302d5cdbde">a rally of thousands that jammed streets</a><!-- --> in Lansing, Michigan, on Wednesday, looked much like one of the president’s rallies — complete with MAGA hats and Trump flags — or one of the tea party rallies from a decade ago. </p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More on the Pandemic:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/7402dedbcf4c07d35111bfd81e98fdc8">– <!-- -->The Latest: WHO scientist says coronavirus is containable</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/fbfc8acc4f61fe5576e531cd8e4acd7f">– <!-- -->What you need to know today about the virus outbreak</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/a4ec3cc7888ff2d58b5618e9f890b9c6">– <!-- -->&#x27;LIBERATE!&#x27;: Trump pushes states to lift virus restrictions</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The signs of frustration come as Trump has pushed for easing stay-at-home orders and tried to look ahead to restarting the economy. He unveiled a <a class="" href="/420a38ec14101eab70e07be367ee6422"> framework for governors to follow on Thursday,</a><!-- --> but acknowledged the governors will have final say on when their state is ready. Health experts warn that lifting restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of new cases of the virus.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But the president and some supporters are impatient. Thousands of people in their cars packed the streets of Lansing to protest Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home restrictions. Outside the Capitol, some chanted “Lock her up,” a throwback to Trump’s calls during the 2016 election about his rival Hillary Clinton. One woman held a sign reading “Heil Witmer.” </p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Asked about the protesters, Trump expressed sympathy with their frustration — “They’re suffering ... they want to get back” — and dismissed concerns about health risks of ignoring state orders and potentially exposing themselves to the virus. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me,” he said. “Nobody wants to stay shut.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">On Friday, he egged the protesters on, tweeting for supporters to “LIBERATE” three states with Democratic governors: Michigan, Virginia and Minnesota. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Polls show the protesters’ views are not widely held. An AP-NORC survey this month found large majorities support government restrictions, including closing schools, limiting gatherings and shuttering bars and restaurants. Three-quarters of Americans backed requiring people to stay home. And majorities of Democrats and Republicans gave high marks to state and city governments.</p><div id="afs:Content:8784512625" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-86">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-87 overrideArticle" href="/tag/VirusOutbreak">Virus Outbreak</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But the protests expose resilient partisan divisions, particularly in battleground Michigan. The protest there was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group founded by a GOP state representative and his wife, Meshawn Maddock, who is on the advisory board for an official Trump campaign group called “Women for Trump” and is also the co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Another group promoting the event, the Michigan Freedom Fund, is run by Greg McNeilly, a longtime political adviser to the DeVos family, who are prolific Republican donors and have funded conservative causes for decades. McNeilly was campaign manager for Dick DeVos, the husband of current U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, during his failed 2006 bid for governor. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Whitmer was among the governors who expressed concern about the gatherings, saying it put people at risk and could prolong the shutdown. Michigan recorded over 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday, and close to 30,000 confirmed infections.

The stay-at-home orders are government overreach, the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says, and the labeling of some workers as “essential” arbitrary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It enrages something inside of you,” said Ackison, who was among those who protested Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son. She has “no fear whatsoever” of contracting \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">the virus\u003c/a>, she said Thursday, dismissing it as hype.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ohio protest was among a growing number staged outside governors' mansions and state Capitols across the country. In places like Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, small-government groups, supporters of President Donald Trump, anti-vaccine advocates, gun rights backers and supporters of right-wing causes have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As their frustration with life under lockdown grows, they’ve defied social distancing rules \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/57f673f31fb343042e3806b9806e8f7d\">in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='297840c06daf40abb1ff805f4533dcfc' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some protests have been small, promoted via Facebook groups that popped up in recent days and whose organizers are sometimes difficult to identify. Others are backed by groups funded by Republican donors, some with ties to Trump. The largest so far, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/098496d0ade7c499110dc2302d5cdbde\">a rally of thousands that jammed streets\u003c/a> in Lansing, Michigan, on Wednesday, looked much like one of the president's rallies — complete with MAGA hats and Trump flags — or one of the tea party rallies from a decade ago. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"696f2d20-6ae0-11ea-b873-7118f8ed5761\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The signs of frustration come as Trump has pushed for easing stay-at-home orders and tried to look ahead to restarting the economy. He unveiled a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/420a38ec14101eab70e07be367ee6422\"> framework for governors to follow on Thursday,\u003c/a> but acknowledged the governors will have final say on when their state is ready. Health experts warn that lifting restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of new cases of the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the president and some supporters are impatient. Thousands of people in their cars packed the streets of Lansing to protest Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home restrictions. Outside the Capitol, some chanted “Lock her up,” a throwback to Trump’s calls during the 2016 election about his rival Hillary Clinton. One woman held a sign reading “Heil Witmer.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Asked about the protesters, Trump expressed sympathy with their frustration — “They’re suffering ... they want to get back” — and dismissed concerns about health risks of ignoring state orders and potentially exposing themselves to the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me,” he said. “Nobody wants to stay shut.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, he egged the protesters on, tweeting for supporters to “LIBERATE” three states with Democratic governors: Michigan, Virginia and Minnesota. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Polls show the protesters' views are not widely held. An AP-NORC survey this month found large majorities support government restrictions, including closing schools, limiting gatherings and shuttering bars and restaurants. Three-quarters of Americans backed requiring people to stay home. And majorities of Democrats and Republicans gave high marks to state and city governments.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8784512625\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the protests expose resilient partisan divisions, particularly in battleground Michigan. The protest there was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group founded by a GOP state representative and his wife, Meshawn Maddock, who is on the advisory board for an official Trump campaign group called “Women for Trump\" and is also the co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another group promoting the event, the Michigan Freedom Fund, is run by Greg McNeilly, a longtime political adviser to the DeVos family, who are prolific Republican donors and have funded conservative causes for decades. McNeilly was campaign manager for Dick DeVos, the husband of current U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, during his failed 2006 bid for governor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitmer was among the governors who expressed concern about the gatherings, saying it put people at risk and could prolong the shutdown. Michigan recorded over 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday, and close to 30,000 confirmed infections. Roughly \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/54b972e6c1c894d959be91c716eb3b0e\">one-quarter of the state’s workforce\u003c/a> has filed for unemployment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But it's not just Democratic governors feeling the heat.
