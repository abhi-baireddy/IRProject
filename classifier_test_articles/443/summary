Saying he wants to end the “international embarrassment” of the U.S. being the only wealthy country that doesn’t provide universal health coverage, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released a new version of his Medicare for All plan Wednesday.
The revamped health care proposal is similar to the plan Sanders released in 2017, though it adds a long-term care benefit for Americans with disabilities.
In the interim, Americans would be given the option to buy into a publicly run health care program.
There would be no premiums, deductibles or co-pays for health services, excluding prescriptions drugs.
Medicare would be required to negotiate drug prices and create a drug formulary listing the medications that may be prescribed.
