News reports have also suggested that Apple, Amazon and Verizon may be mulling a push into cloud gaming of their own.
And Sprint recently said it is partnering with the cloud gaming firm Hatch Entertainment as part of its launch of 5G wireless services.
To help cement its place in the gaming industry, Google said Tuesday it is founding its own, proprietary game development studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment.
Googleâ€™s Stadia controller includes a dedicated button to share captured video game footage straight to YouTube, and the service will support simultaneous YouTube streaming of in-game activities, executives said.
The service is expected to display video at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, said Google, features that are quickly becoming table stakes in the rapidly evolving world of video games.
