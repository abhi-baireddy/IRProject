Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican on the House Oversight Committee, appeared to threaten to release publicly embarrassing details about Michael Cohen one day before Cohen is scheduled to testify before the panel."
Shortly after Gaetz sent out the tweet, some legal experts suggested his statement could amount to witness intimidation and obstruction of justice.
When the Vox reporter Alex Ward asked Gaetz if he had a few minutes to discuss what he implied in his tweet about Cohen, Gaetz replied, "Watch tomorrow."
Asked whether he had any response to suggestions that he was engaging in witness tampering, Gaetz said, "Iâ€™m witness testing.
Gaetz has also joined the White House in coming out swinging against Cohen in recent months, after Cohen pleaded guilty to several felonies and began cooperating with prosecutors.
