As the celebrations began, the visitors were hailed by Mr Xi as a sort of floating United Nations.
A peace-loving China yearned to work with foreign navies to secure international sea-lanes and safeguard the ocean’s riches, Mr Xi declared.
For as China’s navy rises it has more than one goal, he says.
After millennia as an agrarian, continental power, China is a maritime nation, bound to the seas by strategic and commercial interests.
Few foreigners would recognise the Chinese naval ensign today.
