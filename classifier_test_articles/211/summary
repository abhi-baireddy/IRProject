If no one could sue the president for accepting prohibited emoluments, Judge Dennis Shedd asked: "Where's the check on the president?"
Shedd asked if DC and Maryland's interpretation would only protect career politicians.
Shedd asked if a court could order that no person associated with a foreign government could stay at a Trump property.
Shedd asked: If Trump said no foreigners could stay at his hotel, how quickly would Maryland sue for discrimination?
It wasn't speculation to say that people coming to protest Trump weren't booking rooms at Trump's hotel, the judge quipped.
