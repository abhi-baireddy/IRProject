Amid suggestions from Roger Stone and his allies that special counsel Robert Mueller inappropriately leaked the charges he brought against the operative, Mueller filed documents confirming that the grand jury indictment was publicly posted only after Stone had been arrested last month.
Mueller has pointed out that the sealing order allowed for the indictment to be unsealed after Stone was in custody.
A spokesperson emailed the press with a link to the website and an announcement of Stone’s arrest at 6:16 a.m., according to the filing.
Stone alluded to the conspiracy theory in his request that Berman Jackson order a hearing on whether Mueller violated the sealing order.
Berman Jackson has not ordered such a hearing, and instead had requested Mueller clarify “the precise timing and content” of its notice to the media that Stone had been indicted.
