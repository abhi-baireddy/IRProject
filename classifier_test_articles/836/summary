Health clinics have long been barred from using Title X money, or any federal funds, to pay for abortions, but they have been able to provide abortions and other family planning services under one roof.
For instance, it will have to create a separate entrance to the facility for patients seeking abortions, hire separate personnel and establish a separate electronic health records system.
Title X facilities will also be barred from referring patients for abortions .
The rule gives discretion to the department to decide on a case-by-case basis whether facilities are in compliance.
The new Title X rule also removes the longstanding requirement that health care providers inform pregnant patients about their full range of options â€” prenatal care, termination, adoption.
