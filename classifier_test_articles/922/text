At a CNN town hall Monday night in Jackson, Mississippi, Elizabeth Warren was asked about voter disenfranchisement. The Massachusetts senator took her answer a step further saying:

“My view is that every vote matters. And the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the electoral college.”

Politico writes:

Proposals to eliminate the Electoral College have gained steam in the years since President Donald Trump’s 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, when Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost the Electoral College by a wide margin thanks to close defeats in a handful of key states.

Trump’s victory has given way to momentum for a national popular vote, but the Electoral College’s enshrinement in the Constitution has prompted renewed interest in workarounds to spring up like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which member states pledge their state’s electoral college votes to the winner of the national popular vote.
