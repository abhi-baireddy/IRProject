Nathaniel Woods was executed in Alabama on Thursday (March 6), despite a temporary stay on the execution and pleas to reconsider the evidence against him in a case that drew wide attention, the Montgomery Advertiser reports.
Woods, 43, pronounced dead at 9:01 p.m. at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a temporary stay while being reviewed by justices.
Woods was convicted for the June 2004 murders of three Birmingham, Alabama police officers, Carlos Owen, Harley A. Chisolm III, and Charles R. Bennett.
Woods attorneys filed a second petition at 7:06 p.m. in response to the U.S. Supreme Court issuing its temporary stay.
By 7:52 p.m., the court declined to review Woodsâ€™ case and lifted the original stay of execution.
