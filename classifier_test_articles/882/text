Cher, the singer and frequent Trump critic who uses a toilet emoji when referring to the president, disliked the White House’s proposed plan to transport undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities, saying Los Angeles already had people in poverty it could not take care of. “I finally agree with @Cher!” Mr. Trump exclaimed to 59 million Twitter followers.

In addition to his running commentary, Mr. Trump has taken up the role of play-by-play announcer. He first weighed in on the fire that engulfed Notre-Dame, the French cathedral and international symbol of resilience and faith, by suggesting that flying tankers drop water on the 800-year-old structure. The French authorities responded with a pointed English-language statement to say that the building, already buckling under the weight of crumbling wooden beams and limestone, would have been destroyed if that advice had been followed.

This did not deter the president from sharing updates with a crowd of supporters in Minnesota with all the accuracy of a police scanner: “Looks like it’s burning to the ground,” Mr. Trump told his supporters. They gasped at the news. (Notre-Dame, it turned out, did not burn to the ground, but by the time the smoke cleared, Mr. Trump had already moved on to disparaging Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation.)

Mr. Trump has always enjoyed providing his own unique interpretation of the day’s news, in part because for years before coming to Washington he saw himself as a part of the media, first as a tabloid fixture in New York City and then as a cable commentator and reality-television star.

Randal Pinkett, the chairman of BCT Partners, a consulting firm, and winner of season four of “The Apprentice,” recalled in an interview that Mr. Trump was “obsessed with media” and constantly reminded people around him that the show was No. 1 (though it did not crack the top 20).
