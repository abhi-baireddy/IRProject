Republican Rep. Glenn Grothman admitted Trump is not popular enough to get serious legislation passed.
"I think the solution is going to have to come from a popular president who can drive through the solutions that we want.
Right now, our president is not quite popular enough to do it," the congressman said at the event in Fox Crossing, Wisconsin.
Trump, he admitted, "does not have the popularity right now to drive that through."
Trump's current approval in Gallup is 45 percent, a full 12 percentage points what Grothman said Trump needed to get anything done.
