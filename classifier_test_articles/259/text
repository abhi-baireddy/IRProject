Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) Sudan's ousted President Omar al-Bashir was transferred on Tuesday evening to Kober prison, a maximum-security prison notorious for holding political prisoners during his 30-year dictatorship, two prison officials who witnessed his arrival told CNN.

Several other regime figures are being held at the jail and kept separately to Bashir, who is under intensified security measures, the officials said. The prison's main yard has been well-known as a site for executions.

"He would've been led past the same hangman's noose where he sent people to meet their Lord," said one of the prison officials.

Bashir was ousted from power in a military coup last week and was arrested, alongside other top officials, in a sweep of regime figures.

Sudan's military has previously said that it would prosecute Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), but would not extradite him.
