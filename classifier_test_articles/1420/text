President Trump on Tuesday vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. In his veto message, Trump wrote that the measure is an "unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future." The coalition is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who want to take control of the Yemeni government. The Trump administration has said it must support Saudi Arabia in order to keep Iranian influence from spreading. The war has caused a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians dying from illness and starvation. This is the second veto of Trump's presidency.
