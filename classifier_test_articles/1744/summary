Hasson had also searched for “best n----- killing gun” before going to the weapons sales sites, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors allege Hasson had been amassing weapons for an attack since at least 2009, buying weapons from California and Virginia.
After the gun did not fire, the alleged neo-Nazi leader — wearing a black jacket with swastika patches — assaulted the man with Hasson present, prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors said the neo-Nazi leader was convicted and sentenced but did not indicate whether Hasson was charged in the same incident.
Hasson cursed when he learned the FBI had interviewed the leader, prosecutors said.
