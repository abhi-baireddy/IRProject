It remains important, however, to understand the policy errors, large and small, that made the business model of their company, Purdue Pharma, possible.
ADOne way to understand what Purdue Pharma did with OxyContin under Richard Sackler is as an attempted update of his uncle’s success with Valium.
ADIn 2007, Purdue pleaded guilty, as a corporation, to a felony related to false marketing of OxyContin, and paid $635 million.
The Massachusetts lawsuit alleges that the company’s deceptive marketing continued in subsequent years, until Purdue ceased marketing OxyContin last year.
And it is the rare doctor indeed whose professional ethos, however deeply felt, could ever match Richard Sackler’s zeal, reinforced by the profit motive, to turn his opioid into a blockbuster drug.
