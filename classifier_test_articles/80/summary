(AP Photo/Mark Baker)CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — A father and son who fled the civil war in Syria for “the safest country in the world” were buried before hundreds of mourners Wednesday, the first funerals for victims of shootings at two mosques in New Zealand that horrified a nation known for being welcoming and diverse.
The boy tried to stand during the ceremony but had to sit back into his wheelchair, one mourner said.
The Mustafas had moved to New Zealand last year, after spending six years as refugees in Jordan.
