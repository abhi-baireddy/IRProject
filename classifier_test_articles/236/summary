"Tornado or not, there was really very little that would stop me from trying to get out to the polls today," a woman who voted for Elizabeth Warren said.
Bee, who recently started a new job in Washington, DC, had traveled home to Tennessee to vote on Super Tuesday.
When Bee and her mom went to the polls Tuesday morning, there was already a line of people waiting to vote.
There were long lines when she got there, and she posted a photo from the polls on Twitter.
East Nashville isnâ€™t letting a tornado stop us from participating in our democracy.
