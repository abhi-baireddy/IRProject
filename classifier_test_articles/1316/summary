The Swiftly-Defeated Illinois BillIn Illinois, a little over a week ago, Democratic state Rep. Monica Bristow introduced House Bill 3560.
“We live in such a ‘guilty until proven innocent’ culture,” Amy Kwilinski, an Illinois homeschooling mom of six (including four with special needs) told The Federalist.
Other homeschooling parents apparently felt similarly, because within days of Bristow’s bill being referred to the Rules Committee, the sponsor filed a motion to table the bill.
A Different Bill Attempts to Surveil Families In IowaWhile the Illinois bill is essentially dead, a similar bill remains under consideration in Iowa.
The bill’s backing from the Iowa State Education Association, an association that sells itself “an integral part of the 3 million-member National Education Association,” is another huge tell.
