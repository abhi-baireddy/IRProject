"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia," Cohen testified. "I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions."

Trump, who is in Hanoi, Vietnam, for his second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, tweeted that Cohen was "lying in order to reduce his prison time."

Cohen was disbarred in New York on Tuesday -- the same day he testified behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is slated to report to prison next month to serve three years time.
