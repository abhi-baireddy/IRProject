President Trump once praised Israel's border wall system as an example for the United States' own security, but his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, said that his Middle East peace plan would ultimately eliminate dividing lines in the entire Middle East region.
Kushner is currently on a five-nation tour of the Middle East — though he won't be making an appearance in Israel or Palestine, the focal point of the plan — in order to secure regional support for the Trump administration's plan.
Kushner said the economic effect would be felt throughout the Middle East, including Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt.
Trump reportedly supports his son-in-law's free movement plan.
