The Maine American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), which represents over 160 local labor unions across the state, announced its support Tuesday for the state’s recently introduced Green New Deal legislation.
This is the first Green New Deal-branded proposal to be backed by a state AFL affiliate.

Last week, Minnesota introduced its own Green New Deal bill built on close collaboration between youth activists and state lawmakers.
