Michael Cohen's three days of testimony on Capitol Hill began with questions about why he lied to Congress before.
Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, and although it wasn't open to the public, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)
CNN reports Cohen was asked why he lied and whether Trump was involved, although there's no word on what he told them.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told CNN that Cohen was receiving an "extensive grilling" by the committee.
Republicans have dismissed Cohen's testimony as meaningless since he has lied to Congress in the past.
