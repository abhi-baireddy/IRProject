A Florida pediatrician found a suicide tip spliced in the middle of a video posted to the YouTube Kids app, WFTX-TV reported.
Hess told WFTX she's trying to warn other parents about such videos.
As recently as Sunday, Hess noted on her Facebook page that she recorded a version of the clip "directly from YouTube Kids" that very afternoon.
"I had to stop, but I could have kept going," Hess told CBS News.
There are parental controls available on YouTube, WXFT said, adding that users can report or flag inappropriate content as well as video potential dangerous to kids.
