Minnesota Democrat Attorney General Keith Ellison suggested on Thursday that supporters of socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who are often referred to as “Bernie bros,” are not mean or rude to other people despite numerous reports showing the opposite.
Ellison, who is a supporter of Sanders, wrote on Twitter, “I have never seen @BernieSanders supporters being unusually mean or rude.
Can someone send me an example of a ‘Bernie Bro’ being bad?
Waiting to hear.”House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, quickly responded to Ellison, writing, “I can think of an example.”I can think of an example.
Scalise was seriously wounded in the politically motivated terrorist attack and spent six weeks in a hospital fighting for his life.
