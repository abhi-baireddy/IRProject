New data, provided exclusively to Axios by the online job site ZipRecruiter, shows that postings for salon jobs skyrocketed between 2017 and 2018.
But, but, but: Wages for these jobs have remained flat, despite the boom, says Saba Waheed, research director at the UCLA Labor Center.
A recent study by the center found that 78% of nail salon workers earn less than $12.39 an hour — two-thirds of the national median wage in the middle of last year.
Nail salon workers are also predominantly women (81%) and foreign born (79%).
