The release of a redacted version of the long-awaited Mueller report will happen tomorrow, and the top two people at the Justice Department will kick it off with a press briefing:

Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein will hold a press briefing on the Mueller report at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday https://t.co/odvGBjVb1q — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) April 17, 2019

As we told you earlier, a dubious survey has shown that most Americans don’t believe the report will clear President Trump, and another detail about tomorrow morning’s release of the report has, of course, triggered MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow:

Shouldn't… uh… Mueller be there? https://t.co/kPgDUrsXMy — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) April 17, 2019

Well, I guess we know the answer to this question now. https://t.co/ZFO2DufLCg — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) April 17, 2019

We have no idea what’s going to happen, but wouldn’t it be something else if Mueller actually DID show up? In any case, it’s clear that the Resistance won’t be satisfied no matter what happens. However, the Dems will be bringing Mueller in to testify in the House before long anyway.
