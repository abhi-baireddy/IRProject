Levin: ‘Human souls were slaughtered … and they’re attacking our president’Friday on the radio, LevinTV host Mark Levin lit into the American media for claiming the president of the United States is at least partially responsible for the mass murder in a New Zealand mosque late Thursday.
“This didn’t happen in the United States.
“They have very strict gun laws in Australia, and they have strict gun laws in New Zealand.
We do not have a free press in this country; we have a propaganda mill.”“Forty-nine human souls were slaughtered … and they’re attacking our president,” Levin said.
