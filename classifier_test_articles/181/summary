Why are sexual assault and misbehaviour allegations against Biden being ignored?
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has been accused of sexual assault by a former staffer.
It is hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn’t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden.
Reade’s story may be impossible to verify, but this is the case with the vast majority of sexual assault allegations.
Allegations of sexual assault certainly haven’t posed any hindrance to Trump.
