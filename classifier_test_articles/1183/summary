(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress has strong arguments for obtaining President Donald Trump’s tax returns, but first faces a long court battle that could extend into the 2020 presidential election, some legal experts said.
But this does not mean that Congress has unlimited power to request tax returns, experts said.
Consovoy in Monday’s letter said that “no one actually believes” Neal’s “invented” reasons for wanting the tax returns.
But Edward Kleinbard, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California, said Neal’s stated reason for demanding the tax returns — ensuring that tax laws are being enforced against Trump — was more than sufficient.
Kleinbard called that argument “nonsense,” saying nothing prohibits a person under audit from releasing his tax returns.
