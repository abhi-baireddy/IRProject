A $15 per hour minimum wage would lead to $2.4 billion in property crimes, a new paper released Monday argues.
Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already.
Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages for some workers, it also leads to reduced hours and job loss among workers.
A $15 minimum wage would result in 410,000 additional property crimes, equivalent to $2.4 billion in costs.
To these records, they add information on minimum wage increases between 1998 and 2016 by county, state, and federal law, in order to exploit the way that the minimum wage has changed in different places at different times.
