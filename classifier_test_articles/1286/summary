Beck: You have two sons— what was on your mind when they were born and you were looking forward to raising them?
Back in the late ’70s and ’80s I was beginning to connect with the men’s movement in the country.
My son is the father of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and he is a wonderful father.
I wouldn’t let him retreat, I didn’t offer him safe harbor, I was making him go back and contend with these mean boys.
But I realized, when I reflected, that I was actually coming from a place where I was scared for him.
