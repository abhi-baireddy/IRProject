There were few fireworks, and even fewer solutions, as executives from seven major pharmaceutical companies appeared Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee to address high drug prices.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chair, warned in his opening remarks that he and most members of Congress “are sick and tired of the blame game” around drug prices.
The executives blamed middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers for high list prices, which they said were necessary to maintain sales.
Under the system, drug companies raise their list prices so they can offer larger refund payments to the middlemen who control access to drugs for millions of Americans.
The bottom line: It will take much more than high-profile hearings to actually bring down drug prices or broader health care costs.
