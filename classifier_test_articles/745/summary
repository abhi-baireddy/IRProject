The criticism comes after the Times published an article looking into allegations made against Biden by Tara Reade, who says the then-senator sexually assaulted her when she worked as a Biden senate staffer.
ADVERTISEMENTTimes executive editor Dean Baquet told the news organization’s media columnist Ben Smith that the edit was made because the Biden campaign argued the phrasing made it appear that other women had made similar accusations against Biden.
Smith then pressed Baquet on why the Times didn’t acknowledge the change in an editor's note to readers.
In NYT, @benyt asks top editor Dean Baquet some excellent questions about paper's Tara Reade coverage versus its Kavanaugh coverage.
Kudos to @benyt for really pressing Dean Baquet on the possible double standard with respect to Biden and Kavanaugh.
