Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won’t quickly pass a “phase four” coronavirus bill, citing his concern about the cost of another massive spending package.
McConnell tamped down anticipation after President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) agreed this week they’d like massive infrastructure spending in a new bill.
Pelosi insisted Tuesday that a fourth bill would be “specific to the coronavirus challenge” and “recovery” from it, and that she saw infrastructure as common ground.
“We need it big, we need it bold, and we need it futuristic, which means green,” Schumer said on MSNBC.
But we also need new green infrastructure for the future so we should do that.”The three prior coronavirus bills were the product of protracted bipartisan negotiations.
