The town hall was held in Bethlehem, Pa., and was moderated by Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump chided the network over the town hall, which was held on Tax Day with Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate.

"So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the 'audience' was so smiley and nice," he tweeted.

Baier replied Tuesday to Trump's original tweet and invited the president to hold his own town hall or join Baier's show, "Special Report," for an interview.

"Thanks for watching Mr. President - we’d love to have you on a town hall soon — or even an interview on @SpecialReport —it's been awhile. We cover all sides," Baier tweeted.
