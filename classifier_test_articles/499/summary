New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, responding to the warning of Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker that his state is in dire need of protective equipment including masks, sent his team jet to China to transport 1.7 million masks from China, donating $2 million, half of the cost of securing them.
Charlie Baker, who believed had secured over one million masks from Chinese manufacturers, but didn’t know how to transport them, given the situation with flights in and out of China.
He spoke to Robert Kraft’s son, the president of the Patriots and also chairman of the board at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Baker, the U.S. State Department, Robert Kraft and others sent letters to China’s consul general in New York requesting the special permits.
