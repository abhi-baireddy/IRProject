The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied a request by gun-rights advocates to exempt gun stores from an order mandating the closure of businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak in the state.
They brought their case before the state's Supreme Court, but on Sunday, the seven-member court denied their request.
Under Pennsylvania law, citizens are required to physically pick up guns purchased online at gun stores.
So the executive order closing gun stores is effectively shutting down gun sales in the state.
The Free Beacon reported that plaintiffs in the case are now weighing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.
