All could lose money as the Trump administration shifts resources to pay for a border wall.
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Monday delivered to Congress a list of military projects that could be impacted by Trump’s national emergency declaration.
But Shanahan’s list doesn’t account for an additional $2.5 billion in funding that Trump requested for his wall.
AdvertisementCongress voted to reject Trump’s national emergency declaration, but the president used his first veto on the legislation last week.
Despite both the record-long shutdown over border wall funding and the national emergency declaration, a single new linear mile of border wall has yet to be constructed.
