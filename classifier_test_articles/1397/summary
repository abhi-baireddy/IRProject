When I was a child, the grownup books in my house were arranged according to two principles.
St. Helens of books, since it seemed possible that at any moment some subterranean shift in it might cause a cataclysm.
Few generally vertical structures have ever been less stacklike, and no method of storing books has ever looked less like a shelf.
I have spent a great deal of time studying it, yet find many of the books in it impossible to identify.
Plenty of other books in the Stack, however, are perfectly visible, and perfectly familiar.
