Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) raised more large donations from Californians and New Yorkers than he did from Alabama residents, according to campaign finance reports on large individual contributors.
“Another stark comparison to his paltry home-state percentage is the fact that $425,360 of Jones’s $1.6 million in total receipts came from PACs,” the outlet reported.
Interestingly, Jones raised more money from the UK than he did from Alabama in the fourth quarter of last year, Yellowhammer News also reported last month.
“Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) might just have more support in Birmingham, England, than Birmingham, Alabama,” the outlet quipped.
“As denoted by Facebook’s ad archives, Jones’s campaign was programmed to specifically target the news feeds of older individuals in Texas as well as the heavily liberal states of California, Massachusetts, and New York,” the outlet reported.
