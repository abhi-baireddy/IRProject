The statement that came out of the Singapore summit lacked detail, and there has been much debate since then about whether North Korea has taken significant steps to denuclearize.
U.S. officials have been meeting in advance with their North Korean counterparts in recent months.
The U.S. has 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea, which are widely seen as a stabilizing force in the region.
Any change in economic sanctions against North Korea could also have significant ramifications for other Asian nations.
During the Singapore summit last year, for example, many people were caught off guard when Trump said he agreed to suspend military exercises with South Korea.
