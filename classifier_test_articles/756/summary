The London-based start-up, Moonshot CVE, has worked with the Anti-Defamation League and Gen Next Foundation, a philanthropic organization, to develop a pilot program tailored for the United States.
It ran for several months last summer, and senior counterterrorism officials have endorsed the method.
Both worked at a London think tank that focused on Islamic and other forms of extremism issues before they founded Moonshot CVE in 2015.
“Rather than police content, it would try to disrupt the process of radicalization,” said Clark Hogan-Taylor, the head of communications for Moonshot.
The effort to be unveiled in the coming months in the United States will respond to a wide range of search terms.
