House Republicans are planning to introduce a bill to take back the $25 million that the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts received in the COVID-19 response bill, citing the fact that the center furloughed orchestra members hours after the bill was signed into law.
“Nancy Pelosi literally held the bill up for days to get her pet projects including the money for the Kennedy Center.
In the middle of a national emergency, Nancy Pelosi fought to give the Kennedy Center $25 MILLION…and then they stopped paying their musicians anyway.
“The Covid-19 Advisory Committee was broadsided today during our conversation with [Kennedy Center President] Deborah Rutter,” the email read.
On March 12, the Kennedy Center announced it would cancel all public performances and events and shut its doors to the public through March 31.
