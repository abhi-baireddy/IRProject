While the coronavirus pandemic has dashed brunch plans for the foreseeable future, takeout and delivery from some of your favorite restaurants is still an option during the COVID-19 lockdown.
“The risk of contracting coronavirus through food has been, and is, extremely small,” Martin Wiedmann, a professor of food safety in Cornell University’s food science department, tells The Post.
Wash your hands before you eat delivery foodSome delivery platforms are starting to do contact-free delivery — dropping food at your doorstep so there’s no change of hands.
If you accidentally touch while tipping your delivery person, just remember to wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water.
“Even if I stay in my house and lock myself in, and eat no food, my risk of acquiring coronavirus is not zero,” says Wiedmann.
