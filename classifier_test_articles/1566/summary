Pushing back the Brexit deadline doesn’t rule out a no-deal Brexit; it might just postpone it.
This would be a reprise of the Brexit vote in January, where Parliament voted down May’s Brexit plan by a historic 230-vote margin.
Remember, May is offering two votes if her deal fails: one on a no-deal Brexit and another on extending the Brexit deadline.
Extending the Brexit date does not eliminate the possibility of a no-deal Brexit — it just delays the disaster for a few more months.
All of which is to say, a no-deal Brexit is looking a little less likely — at least on March 29.
