Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a campaign event in Chicago, Ill., March 3, 2019.
Again, Bernie Sanders is distinguishing himself from his Democratic colleagues on matters of character, confidence, and imagination.

Many Republicans who watch Fox News and consume populist media can get the distinct impression that Democrats are just waiting for them to die.
