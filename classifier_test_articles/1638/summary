"Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died," reads the Monday headline from the Associated Press.
Other outlets have expanded on this innuendo: "Deaths Of Six Men Tied To Ferguson Protests Prompt Fear Of Sinister Connection"; "Deaths of six men tied to Ferguson protests alarm activists"; "Deaths of Ferguson activists lead some to believe something sinister is at play."
The result of the framing is the far left cited the AP story on social media as vindication for the conspiracy.
McCarrel was a member of the Ohio branch of Black Lives Matter, but he never actually participated in the Ferguson protests.
It's distressing to see activists pushing such a deranged conspiracy theory, but it's even sadder to see media outlets fanning the flames.
