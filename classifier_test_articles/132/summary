Gavin Newsom says he’s pondering how to give illegal immigrants state support, after they were left out of the federal stimulus bill.
President Trump has said it’s “something we’re working on.”Illegal immigrants and DACA recipients say they deserve more.
Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts Democrat, said this week that illegal immigrants must be able to access federal coronavirus assistance.
Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies, counters that the country doesn’t owe illegal immigrants anything.
He said more broadly, the coronavirus crisis shows why it’s “unwise” to have a large illegal immigrant population.
