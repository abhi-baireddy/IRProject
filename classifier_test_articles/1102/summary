To US politicians on both sides of the aisle content to luxuriate in seemingly infinite debt, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has a simple warning: “Federal government debt is on an unsustainable path.”Speaking today (Feb. 26) at his semiannual congressional visit, Powell spoke out against the government’s growing levels of debt, which are spiraling at a much greater rate than GDP growth.
Defaulting on these debts—as the heterodox macroeconomic theory Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) proposes—is simply unthinkable, Powell said.
(They now total just over $22 trillion, with the annual federal deficit on course to top $1 trillion in the next few years.)
This model suggests printing more dollars to cover US debt obligations, allowing the government to continue running with a deficit in perpetuity.
Because the US borrows in US dollars, the theory goes, the deficit doesn’t matter as much as it does for other countries.
