The Trump administration has been openly speaking about keeping the report of special counsel Robert Mueller under wraps, releasing only a self-interested summary by Attorney General William Barr, a man who owes his job to President Donald Trump.
Any effort to sanitize the report that Mueller is said to be finalizing would be a massive political miscalculation and a national travesty.
Nothing short of the full report — possibly with some redactions to protect legitimate national security concerns and grand jury testimony — is acceptable in this case.
The mere possibility that the Justice Department could sit on the report is highly problematic.
In the meantime, any effort to sugarcoat or suppress the special counsel's taxpayer-paid findings must not be allowed to stand.
