(hello, climate change), farmers are now in the sixth year of plummeting prices for their crops and livestock.
No surprise then that since 2000, half of America’s dairy farmers have been squeezed out of business by monopoly pricing.
And now comes Trump’s trade spat with China, which has collapsed the market and prices for grain farmers.
Our farmers and their families are hurting, but so far, our leaders, including the president, aren’t helping them.
Not satisfied with intentionally injuring family farmers, Trump added insult by calling the dab of support they get from the government “overly generous.” This from a real estate flimflammer who continues to rake in millions of dollars in government cash and special tax breaks.
