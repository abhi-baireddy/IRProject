The Stranger:On Tuesday evening a bill requiring all presidential and vice presidential candidates to disclose the last 5 years of their tax returns in order to appear on Washington state ballots passed the Senate floor.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Patty Kuderer (D-Bellevue), passed 28 to 21 along party lines, because of course it did.
Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill that passed through both chambers there.”This is pretty cool!
Inslee will sign it: he’s always shown his returns, and as a contender in the 2020 Goat Rodeo this shows he means bidness about transparency.
Comrade Stupid is unlikely to win Washington and might decide to skip being on the ballot altogether, while the Democrats have pretty much always released their tax returns.
