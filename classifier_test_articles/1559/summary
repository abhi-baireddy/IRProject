Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported the widower of a U.S. soldier to Mexico last week, despite his legal permission to live in the United States, according to his attorney.
ICE agents arrested Jose Gonzalez Carranza, 30, in Phoenix on April 8, Carranza’s lawyer Ezequiel Hernandez told numerous media publications.
Carranza told the Republic he was living at a shelter for deported migrants in Nogales, even though he did not know the city.
It is unclear why ICE allowed Carranza to return to the United States, though his attorney believes it’s because the media brought attention to the story.
“Once I have a statement to issue, I will be sure you receive it,” an ICE spokesperson told VICE News in an email.
