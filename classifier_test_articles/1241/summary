The Republican communications consultant who was sued — alongside two parody Twitter accounts — by Rep. Devin Nunes (D-CA) in his legal crusade against Twitter’s alleged bias against conservatives, said in a statement on Tuesday that she and Nunes don’t see eye-to-eye on the First Amendment.
“I have very different views on the applicable law (including the First Amendment) than Rep. Nunes,” she said in the statement posted to Twitter.
“I will say that as a libertarian Republican, I personally hold very dear the principles of the First Amendment.
He’s using the suit to add fodder to a conservative conspiracy theory that social media accounts are out to get conservatives.
President Trump even boosted the theory Tuesday.
