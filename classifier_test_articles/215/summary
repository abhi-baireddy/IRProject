Joe Biden indicated Tuesday that he has cleared a significant hurdle as he decides whether to run for president in 2020.
“I’ll just tell you straight up,” Biden said, responding to a question from Meacham during the livestreamed event.
We do everything by family meetings, because no man or woman has a right to run for high public office without it being a family decision.
The Democratic Party, and the political environment at large, has changed since Biden was vice president under Barack Obama.
Biden, ostensibly, was supposed to interview Meacham, but Meacham, a journalist, at several points tried to steer the conversation to Biden’s future plans.
