Where’s Hunter Biden?
This all occurred in 2014 when his dad, Papa Joe, the vice president, was spearheading anti-corruption efforts in the country.
Then, there’s this issue with his board position on BHR Partners, a private Chinese equity firm that’s run by Joe Biden and John Kerry’s children.
[…] As of Tuesday, BHR’s file on China’s National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System (NECIPS) still lists Hunter Biden as being a director of BHR.
Qixinbao, an independent service that provides registration information on Chinese corporations, also listed Hunter Biden as a member of the BHR board on Tuesday.
