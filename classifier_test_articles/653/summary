Barely an hour later, according to police, one of the men blew himself up in the restaurant of the Shangri-La hotel as part of a wave of Easter suicide bombings across Sri Lanka.
Islamic State said Tuesday that the attackers — at least two of whom are believed to have lived in the rented safe house — were its fighters.
In a statement issued by its Amaq news agency, the extremist group claimed responsibility for the coordinated blasts against churches and luxury hotels.
“The bombings in Sri Lanka were highly complex and extremely sophisticated,” Blank said.
The other suicide bombings targeted a Catholic church in Colombo, a Protestant church in the eastern city of Batticaloa and three five-star hotels in central Colombo.
