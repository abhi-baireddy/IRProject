I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.
I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty — of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.
I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.
Take, for instance, this bit of his testimony:The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump.
To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.
