One of the great mysteries of the business world is why Deutsche Bank lent financial pariah Donald Trump $2 billion over two decades, when other firms treated him like an infectious disease capable of wiping out entire populations.
Thanks to Democrats’ newly obtained subpoena power, the answer may be revealed through the “extensive internal documents and communications about Mr. Trump” the bank is expected to start handing over to congressional committees next month.
In the meantime, however, a report from The New York Times about the president’s relationship with the German lender has shed some light on the matter.
As a result, reporter David Enrich writes, bank executives were happy not only to ignore repeated, glaring red flags, but to go along with Trump’s cornucopia of financial lies.
And a senior investment-banking executive said in an interview that he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.
