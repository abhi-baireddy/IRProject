Former pizza exec Herman Cain said Wednesday he won’t withdraw his name from consideration for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board despite a lack of GOP support in the Senate.

Cain told The Wall Street Journal that he’s “very committed” to hanging on as the White House considers whether to formally nominate him for the position.

Cain, 73, a Tea Party conservative and former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, said the Fed needs “new voices” and it has been “too quick” to raise interest rates in the past, a view he shared with Trump and his top economic adviser, Lawrence Kudlow, at the White House in January, the paper reported.

“The president asked me one simple question…He said, ’Would you consider doing this if you make it through the process?’ I said yes. Didn’t hesitate,” Cain said during the interview at his office in suburban Atlanta.

Trump announced on April 4 that he wanted Cain for the job.

But last week, four Republican senators said they wouldn’t support Cain over concerns including multiple sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied.

Unless some of those senators change their minds — or Cain manages to convince Democrats or an Independent to back him — that would leave him short of the votes needed to be confirmed.

Kudlow said Tuesday “it will probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in that process or not.”

But Cain wasn’t buying what Kudlow was selling.

“What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don’t want an out. I don’t want an out,” Cain said.
