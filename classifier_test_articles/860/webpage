She said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in social distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines set to be released Thursday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Birx said the White House was particularly concerned about Rhode Island, noting it is now seeing a surge in cases from the Boston metro area after seeing a spike several weeks ago from cases from New York.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump consulted dozens of high-profile CEOs, union officials and other executives via conference calls Wednesday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">He received a mixed message from the industry leaders.

Many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump was told “the economy will look very different and operations will look very different,” one participant said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was among several representatives from major sports leagues to speak with Trump.

(AP) — The ranks of America's unemployed swelled toward Great Depression-era levels Thursday, and President Donald Trump reacted to the pressure on the economy by outlining a phased approach to reopening parts of the country where the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fbaf41fd4eb91bb17432d94b7b0d1652\">coronavirus\u003c/a> is being brought under control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump told the nation's governors that restrictions could be eased to allow businesses to reopen over the next several weeks in places that have extensive testing and a marked decrease in COVID-19 cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time,” Trump said, adding that his new guidelines give governors the freedom to act as they see fit. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His comments marked an abrupt change after a week in which he clashed with governors over his claim that he had “total” authority over how and when the country reopens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both Democratic and Republican governors welcomed the moderate White House approach, which calls for a gradual, three-phase reopening of businesses and schools.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In phase one, for example, theaters, sporting venues and churches would open “under strict physical distancing protocols,” but bars would remain closed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said reopening could be imminent in some places, and he has remarked that data suggests coronavirus cases have peaked in the U.S. Scientists have said it’s not clear that is the case, and they warned states to proceed with caution to prevent the virus from storming back.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president unveiled his reopening plan the same day the government reported 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to 22 million — easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about 1 in 7 American workers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While many Americans have chafed at the damage to their livelihoods, business leaders and governors have warned that more testing and protective gear are needed before they can start lifting the lockdowns and other restrictions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“My No. 1 focus is to keep my family safe, so I’m really not in a hurry to put an end to this,” said Denise Stockwell, who is about to lose her job in marketing at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But conservative economist Steven Moore, a Trump ally, said there will be 30 million people out of work in the country if the economy doesn’t open back up soon. “And that is a catastrophic outcome for our country. Period,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In China, official data released Friday showed GDP shrank 6.8% from a year ago in the quarter ending in March, its worst contraction since market-style economic reforms began in 1979. Consumer spending and manufacturing activity remain weak despite factories and offices reopening starting last month, suggesting recovery may be longer and harder than initially expected. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some forecasters earlier said China might rebound as early as this month, but they have been cutting growth forecasts and pushing back recovery timelines as negative trade, retail sales and other data pile up. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Worldwide, the outbreak has infected more than 2.1 million people and killed more than 140,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be much higher. The death toll in the U.S. reached about 31,000, with around 650,000 confirmed infections.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se4:45ac0610-6ae0-11ea-8a95-eb445148c326\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"This chart is updated once a day.\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-5wn81\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5wn81/4/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"Interactive area chart COVID-19: the status of cases worldwide\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The spread of the virus is declining in such places as Italy, Spain and France, but rising or continuing at a high level in Britain, Russia and Turkey, authorities said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In other developments:\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Vladimir Putin postponed Russia's grand \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/f916b39113ff2a94c2cfbb0b76a446e7\">Victory Day parade\u003c/a> May 9 in Red Square marking the 75th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II.

More than 3,000 turned out this week to decry the Michigan governor’s restrictions, police broke up a demonstration in North Carolina, and protests also took place in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Virginia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Those people that know they’re vulnerable, self-quarantine. And everybody else, let them go back to work,\" Aaron Carver, a laid-off construction worker, said at a protest in Richmond, Virginia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The decision of whether to relax the restrictions rests not with the White House but with the state and local leaders who imposed them in the first place. Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday that they will coordinate on reopening their economies, after similar pacts among states in the Northeast and on the West Coast. \u003c/p>\u003cp>West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump ally, said capacity and contact tracing would need to be considerably ramped up before restrictions could be safely lifted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“All would be forgotten very quickly if we moved into a stage quicker than we should, and then we got into a situation where we had people dying like flies,” Justice said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the White House guidance makes clear “the best path to reopening is still a cautious one that proceeds carefully and incrementally.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Two in three Americans expressed concerns that restrictions would be eased too quickly, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Economists said unemployment could reach 20% in April, the highest since the Depression of the 1930s. Layoffs are spreading well beyond stores, restaurants and hotels to white-collar professionals such as software programmers and legal assistants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lifting of restrictions, when it happens, won't be like flipping a switch. Restaurants and other businesses may be reopened in phases, with perhaps a limited number of entrances or reduced seating areas, while supermarkets may stick with one-way aisles and protective shields at the cash registers, experts say.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It might be ‘back to normal’ for everyone else, but people still don’t feel comfortable gathering at restaurants and bars,” said Jeremiah Juncker, manager of the Rappourt pub in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many European countries, like the U.S., have seen heavy job losses, but places like Germany and France are using government subsidies to keep millions of people on payrolls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy’s hard-hit Lombardy region is pushing to restart manufacturing in early May, while Britain extended restrictions at least three more weeks.

And clothing stores, movie theaters, entertainment venues. And countless small businesses, from bookstores to barber shops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, the record-setting flood of layoffs unleashed by the viral outbreak is extending beyond the services industries that bore the initial brunt and are still suffering most. White collar employees, ranging from software programmers and legal assistants to sales associates and some health care workers, are absorbing layoffs or salary cuts. So are workers in other occupations, like construction and real estate. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The mounting toll of job losses resulted last week in \u003ca href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">5.2 million new applications\u003c/a> for unemployment benefits, the Labor Department said Thursday. That raised the total number of laid-off workers in the month since the virus all but shut down the economy to 22 million — by far the worst run of U.S. job losses on record.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There really is no industry that is immune from the effects of the outbreak,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at job listings website Glassdoor, said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Employee discussions of layoffs on Glassdoor have jumped 47% among information technology firms and 64% in finance, Zhao said. Such discussions have nearly doubled among workers in health care. That’s no longer surprising: Many doctors’ offices and other health providers have cut back on nonessential procedures, and some are shedding jobs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The software company Toast, which works with the restaurant industry, last week cut half its workforce — 1,300 people — citing a dizzying drop in restaurant sales. Yelp, the customer review site, cut 1,000 jobs. Groupon, the online discount company, shed 2,800. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Layoffs jumped by nearly 40,000 in Texas earlier this month, the government's report said, fueled partly by job losses in a category that includes data processing and online publishing companies. In Maine, job cuts swept through employers in the professional and scientific fields, which includes architectural and engineering companies. Healthcare workers and administrative support staff lost jobs in Tennessee.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some law firms have felt compelled to shrink their staffs, too. One victim was Fern Weinbaum, who was furloughed last month from her job as a legal secretary at a small law firm in Manhattan. Weinbaum, 68, still hasn’t received her unemployment benefits, which she is counting on to help pay her monthly rent of $1,100.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I am very anxious, I need the money,” she said. “It’s very frustrating.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The grim figures on layoffs, furloughs and salary cuts point to a U.S. economy that is tumbling into what appears to be a calamitous recession, the worst in decades. The nation’s output could shrink by roughly 10.5% before it starts to rebound, according to Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. That would be more than double the contraction that occurred during the 2008-2009 recession, which was the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \u003c/p>\u003cp>All businesses deemed nonessential have been closed in nearly every state. Some economists say the unemployment rate could reach as high as 20% in April, which would be the highest rate since the Depression. By comparison, unemployment never topped 10% during the Great Recession.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coronavirus is also hammering economies around the world. The International Monetary Fund said this week that the global economy will likely shrink 3% this year, the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/8f170d4aae2073c692d0fa40da6abcf4\">worst downturn since the 1930s\u003c/a>. The IMF forecasts that the European economies that use the euro currency will shrink 7.5%, while Japan's contracts 5.2%. The global lending agency, which \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/07fb8539558cba2c42bdc45ee3226faf\">has seen 102 of its 189 member nations\u003c/a> ask it for assistance, does forecast a solid rebound next year. But it said the outlook is unusually uncertain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A quarter of British companies said they had shut or suspended business, according to a survey done in the week through April 5. Those that have remained open have furloughed an average 21% of their staff.\u003c/p>\u003cp>European unemployment is expected to rise toward 10%, according to economists at IHS Markit. That figure doesn't count millions who are working reduced hours or are on leave and earning partial pay under European government programs that are meant to keep people on payrolls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the United States, too, many white collar workers have been hit with pay cuts even while keeping their jobs. That's preferable to a layoff, though the reduced income, multiplied across the economy, is sure to slow consumer spending and depress the economy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Medical-device maker Boston Scientific is \u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/02/business/boston-scientific-cuts-pay-36000-workers-citing-revenue-drop-because-coronavirus/\">putting most of its full-time workers\u003c/a>, outside sales and manufacturing, on four-day work weeks and cutting their pay 20% for at least the next three months. The company has 17,000 workers in the United States. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Rhode Island and Michigan, 24% of each state's workforce has requested unemployment aid, the worst among all the states, followed by Hawaii with 23% and Pennsylvania and Nevada at 22%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>All told, nearly 12 million people nationwide are now receiving unemployment checks, essentially matching the peak reached in January 2010, shortly after the Great Recession officially ended. That figure is less than the number of applicants in part because it lags behind the number of first-time jobless claims figure by a week. And many people who apply for unemployment aid are turned down and don't actually receive checks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many of the jobless whose applications for unemployment aid haven't been accepted are likely self-employed and gig workers. The government's $2.2 trillion economic relief package provides jobless benefits to those groups for the first time. But \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/5007af9b58af051acacaa7baee6c0181\"> most states have to set up new computer systems\u003c/a> to process those claims — a process that could take weeks in some cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The delays in many states in processing applications for contractors and gig workers is a problem for people like Celia Rocha, 44, who lost what she called her “dream job” as a studio assistant to an artist in Los Angeles after California ordered all non-essential businesses to close last month. Rocha, who had worked as a contractor for three years, said she applied for benefits but was turned down. When she has called the state’s phone line to ask questions, she has received only a recording directing her to the website. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You can’t talk to someone and have your questions answered,” Rocha said. “There’s no information about when we can apply for this” on the state’s website. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Wednesday, California said it was intending to have a website for the self-employed and contractors active by Monday. \u003c/p>\u003cp> ___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Business Writers Anne D’Innocenzio in New York and Carlo Piovano in London contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US-Virus Outbreak-Unemployment Benefits","headline":"Layoffs and pay cuts are now striking more white collar jobs","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fb33b19770c945bf19a40456f060e593","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"fb33b19770c945bf19a40456f060e593_8a8aza0c0","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fb33b19770c945bf19a40456f060e593","version":null,"videoContext":"\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["0e49622657f045dc8cef860d1cd638f2","eba9240a557a40c79f6d604510cff15b"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/0e49622657f045dc8cef860d1cd638f2/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"A man looks at the closed sign in front of Illinois Department of Employment Security in Chicago, Wednesday, April 15, 2020.

But experts urge people to consider all alternatives first. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tax on withdrawals can be prohibitively expensive, even if spread out over time. And by selling holdings now, participants are taking money out at a low point in the market. They also are unlikely to pay it back. And most importantly, it takes money away for when they will need it — in retirement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“(It) is truly, truly the alternative of last resort. That is where we go last,” said Evelyn Zohlen, chair of the Financial Planners Association. “That is sacrificing your future financial security for your current financial security.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that about half of today’s working families — before the crisis — would not have been able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. Part of the reason is that people take money out of their retirement accounts early. Alicia Munnell, director of the center, said their best estimate is that about 1.5% of assets leak out each year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“That may not sound like much, but it means that assets at retirement are 20% less than they would have been without leakage,” Munnell said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ALTERNATIVES\u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts urge people to consider alternative sources for cash first. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If you have an emergency savings account, this is the time to use it, said Eliza Badeau, director of Thought Leadership at Fidelity Investments. The next line of defense is money held somewhere not exposed to the stock market, such as a CD. Then consider other non-retirement accounts that do have stock market exposure — such as a brokerage account, vested restricted stock or share purchased in an employee stock purchase plan. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If your situation is temporary, consider using a credit card with no balance to pay for essentials. Do this only if you can pay the balance within the month. A personal loan or a home equity loan is another option, only if your situation is temporary and the rates are favorable. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8753561358\">Full Coverage: Life\u003c/div>\u003cp>In addition, make sure you are reducing as much as possible the money spent in your household. That means taking advantage of relief programs, such as those for student loan payments, delayed income tax payments or more. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If you still must tap into retirement savings, consider a loan first instead of a withdrawal. A borrower doesn’t face the same tax consequences and there is a lessened impact on your future financial situation because borrowers are forced to repay the loan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>However, if you leave your employer — by choice or not — loans must be repaid shortly after that time. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Take only what you need to minimize impact, but take enough to sustain you as plans typically limit the number of loans or withdrawals people can make. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If you do withdraw money from your retirement account, make sure to have a plan to pay the taxes and pay the account back, said Michael Foguth, of the Fouguth Financial Group in Michigan. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is not necessarily a bad idea, if done correctly,” Foguth said. “Given the circumstances, you have to do what you have to do.”\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Retirement Plan Withdrawals","headline":"Hit by the virus and weighing a raid on your 401(k)?

Job losses were greatest in wholesale and retail businesses and accommodation, food and education services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While the unemployment rate slightly dropped from last year to 4.2%, Statistics Korea official Eun Sun-hyun said that was because fewer people were in search of jobs as they looked to avoid social contact amid fears of virus transmissions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of people deemed economically inactive — not having a job, nor looking for one — rose by more than half a million to 16.9 million people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Gov.

The state’s highest court let her order stand on technical grounds, without deciding whether it violated freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. or Kansas constitutions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lawsuit was filed by First Baptist Church in Dodge City and Pastor Stephen Ormond and Calvary Baptist Church in Junction City and Pastor Aaron Harris.

He said the money would go to Palestinian hospitals and households to “meet immediate, life-saving needs in combating COVID-19.” He said the United States “is committed to assisting the Palestinian people” during the crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friedman has been a main proponent of the administration’s pro-Israel stance, promoting the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv, eliminating American assistance to the Palestinian Authority and ending funding for the U.N. agency responsible for Palestinian refugees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has issued new guidelines for states, individuals and employers on how to ease up on social distancing to deal with the coronavirus in areas where COVID-19 are on the decline.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The guidelines distributed to governors are published under the headline “Opening Up America Again.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The guidelines say states or regions should meet certain criteria before moving to a phased opening. For example, there needs to be a downward trajectory of documented COVID-19 cases within a 14-day period and a robust testing program in place for at-risk health care workers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For states and regions that satisfy the criteria for a “phase one” opening, the guidelines recommend that vulnerable individuals should continue to shelter in place. Others who go out should avoid socializing in groups of more than 10 people in places that don’t provide appropriate physical distancing. Trade shows are cited as an example.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For specific types of employers, it’s recommended that bars remain closed as part of phase one.

Ultimately, decisions on when to ease up will rest with governors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump talked to governors before he unveils the guidelines to the public in the evening. The announcement comes on the same day the government said 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said on Monday that his “authority is total” to reopen states but has since backed away from that claim after governors pointed out the Constitution does not grant the president that power.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump told the governors some of them are in good shape to open their states quickly, but others are in tough shape. He remarked that requests for ventilators have gone away, adding, “I say that respectfully.” He also asserted that “we’re in excellent shape” on testing, which many health care officials have disputed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>LANSING, Mich. — Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday that they will coordinate on reopening their state economies, after similar pacts were made earlier this week in the Northeast and on the West Coast.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Thursday’s announcement covers Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The governors say they will work with experts and take a “fact-based, data-driven approach to reopening our economy in a way that protects families from the spread of COVID-19.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Altogether, the 17 states covered by the three pacts are home to nearly half the U.S. population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ROME — Italy will begin administering experimental coronavirus immunity tests on an initial 150,000 people nationwide in early May as part of its efforts to reopen after a weekslong shutdown.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy’s commissioner for the pandemic, Domenico Arcuri, told state-run RAI news Thursday that the government hopes the first wave of tests will progressively grow in number and become the national standard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy, the European epicenter of the pandemic, has imposed a lockdown and production shutdown through May 3.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Individual regions and even companies are already gunning to start antibody tests to accelerate the reopening. But Arcuri made clear the government wants a unified approach in testing, which he said would be one of the “fundamental pillars” of moving into the next phase of the emergency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Arcuri said another pillar involved rolling out a voluntary contact-tracing cellphone application, to provide real-time data on movements of people and possible new clusters of infection. A pilot program would begin in some regions and then extend nationwide, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron says China hasn’t been fully transparent about its handling of the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview appearing Friday in the Financial Times, Macron said: “Let’s not be so naive as to say (China) has been much better at handling this.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macron continued: “We don’t know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.” He didn’t elaborate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The comments come amid growing international questions about how China released information about the virus.
