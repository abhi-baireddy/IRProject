About 43% of the delegates are from abroad, mostly from Africa, and overwhelmingly support the LGBT bans.
If the bans were eased, “the church in Africa would cease to exist,” said the Rev Jerry Kulah of Liberia.
“We can’t do anything but to support the Traditional Plan – it is the biblical plan.”The deep split within the church was evident in several fiery speeches opposing the Traditional Plan.
Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States.
While other mainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal and Presbyterian (USA) churches, have embraced gay-friendly practices, the Methodist church still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied.
