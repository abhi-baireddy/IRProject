Harley-Davidson announced Tuesday its profits dropped almost 27 percent in the first quarter, and partially blamed tariffs from EU and China for the decline.
President Trump weighed in on the matter, tweeting the U.S. "will reciprocate" against the EU for the tariffs.
EU tariffs on Harley cycles jumped from 6 percent to 31 percent last year in response to the Trump administration putting tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
President Trump expressed his disapproval of the decision, threatening to tax the company "like never before!"
