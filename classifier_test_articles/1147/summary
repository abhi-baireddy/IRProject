(Reuters) - The University of Southern California said it may expel students tied to a brazen U.S. college-admissions scam after reviewing their records, which could lead the college to throw out “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin’s two daughters.

Prosecutors said some students involved in the scandal were not aware their parents had made the alleged arrangements, although in other cases they knowingly took part.
Stanford said it was “working to better understand the circumstances around” one of its students linked to the scheme.
The Hallmark cable channel last week cut ties with Loughlin after her alleged role in the fraud was disclosed.
