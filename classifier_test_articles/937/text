Some current and former White House staffers are worried the soon-to-be-released report by special counsel Robert Mueller will reveal them as the sources of damaging information relating to President Donald Trump, NBC News is reporting.

A redacted version of the report is set to be released on Thursday. Some of those who cooperated with Mueller’s probe are questioning whether their names will be redacted or whether the information in the report points directly at them as a source.

According to the network news some are particularly concerned about how Trump – and his allies, will deal with them. One source described it as “breakdown level anxiety.”

“They got asked questions and told the truth and now they’re worried the wrath will follow,” one former White House official said.

“You have a whole bunch of former White House officials and current White House officials, but especially former White House officials, who were told to cooperate. So people went and did that, and now the uncertainty is just how much of that information is going to be in that report and how identifiable to individuals is it going to be. And nobody knows.”

Trump, in a Monday tweet, blasted the report. He said it was “written by 18 Angry Democrats who also happen to be Trump Haters (and Clinton Supporters), should have focused on the people who SPIED on my 2016 Campaign, and others who fabricated the whole Russia Hoax.”
