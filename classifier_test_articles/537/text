On Monday, April 15, a week of events taking place in major cities around the world aims to draw attention to the existential climate crisis that we face. Extinction Rebellion, born in the UK last year, uses direct action to make demands of governments. Now, spreading to countries like Germany, France, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, and the US, the climate activists of Extinction Rebellion have a singular message of declaring "an international non-violent rebellion against the world's governments for criminal inaction on the ecological crisis." They want a zero emissions energy economy in five years.
