Yuma, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, declared a state of emergency Tuesday, saying it cannot handle the crush of illegal immigrants the government is being forced to release onto its streets.
Mr. Nicholls said he is trying to get other Arizona communities to issue similar declarations, hoping a critical mass of voices will cut through the partisan gridlock.
The ruling, though, won’t generally affect the children and families, who are quickly released under other court rulings and laws.
In the meantime, the council said, the administration should issue an emergency regulation allowing migrant families to be held.
Communities along the border have issued desperate pleas for help, but Yuma’s state of emergency is the most striking reaction.
