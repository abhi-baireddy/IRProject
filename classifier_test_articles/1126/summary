A special federal law enforcement task force dedicated to stopping the flow of opioids into the United States was deployed in southern Arizona for eight days in March.
Rather than targeting opioids, the Interior Department's Opioid Reduction Task Force seems to have been used primarily to enforce immigration laws.
It should also raise questions about why a federal opioid task force was deployed for eight days in a part of the country that does not include a port of entry.
In addition to stopping 422 vehicles and searching 129 of them, the Opioid Reduction Task Force deployed its K-9 units 89 times and responded to 40 "K-9 alerts."
The task force also handed out 14 traffic tickets.
