2017 saw a depressingly low count of 25,000 workers striking in major work stoppages; 2018â€™s total topped 485,000.
But that decline in official union membership is happening at the same time as an uptick in on-the-job militancy.
The strikes of 2018 included illegal strikes, rank-and-file-led strikes, and strikes of the unorganized (most notably anti-sexual harassment walkouts at Google).
Changes in union leadership, fights, and splits are likely in the near future as workers keep fighting.
Hopefully the current movement will reverse declining union membership.
