An iceberg about twice the size of New York City is expected to break off an ice shelf in Antarctica, NASA says.
Researchers are monitoring a giant crack in the center of the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
In 2017, an iceberg the size of Delaware broke off the Antarctic ice shelf, one of the largest on record.
The potential iceberg, however, could be the largest to break from the Brunt Ice Shelf since observations started in 1915, researchers say.
