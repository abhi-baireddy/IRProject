An iceberg about twice the size of New York City is expected to break off an ice shelf in Antarctica, NASA says.

Researchers are monitoring a giant crack in the center of the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The crack had been stable for 35 years but has started accelerating toward another fissure called the Halloween crack.

When the larger crack makes its way completely across, it will create an iceberg of at least 660 square miles in a process called calving.

"We don’t have a clear picture of what drives the shelf’s periods of advance and retreat through calving," Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with NASA and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said in a statement. "The likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible."

The iceberg itself isn't as big as other recent masses. In 2017, an iceberg the size of Delaware broke off the Antarctic ice shelf, one of the largest on record. The potential iceberg, however, could be the largest to break from the Brunt Ice Shelf since observations started in 1915, researchers say.

It's not clear when the iceberg will break off, Shuman said, but researchers are closely watching it. "It could calve within the next few days, or weeks, or possibly even longer."
