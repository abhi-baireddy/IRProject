The latest battle for Chicago began last September when Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he was not running for a third term.
The Burke-Solis scandals have pulled back the mask of the corrupt relationship between the real-estate goliath gentrifying Chicago and the political class that serves it.
In both cases, the city council voted 48-1 to approve both projects that would accelerate the rapid gentrification of working-class, black communities.
The virtually unanimous vote demonstrated, once again, how much of a rubber stamp the city council was for Rahm.
Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, was the sole dissenting vote on the cop academy.
