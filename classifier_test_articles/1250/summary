Jair Bolsonaro, the anti-LGBTQ president of Brazil who’s been called the “Trump of the Tropics,” praised Donald Trump’s similarly anti-LGBTQ ideology after the two met today.
“The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere, and hopefully, by the way, it’s also arrived, that twilight hour, in our great country,” Trump said.
LGBTQ groups criticized Trump for “normalizing” Bolsonaro.
“Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a tyrant who has condoned violence against LGBTQ people, even if it means death,” said a statement issued by Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD.
