For 59 years, the United States has maintained a cruel embargo against Cuba.
In 1960, the Eisenhower administration declared a partial embargo on trade with Cuba in an attempt to pressure Cuba to change its form of government.
Although Barack Obama took some limited steps toward normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, Helms-Burton would have prevented him from lifting the embargo.
Cuba seeks resolution of its claims as part of its attempt to mutually resolve issues between Cuba and the United States.
By refusing to further suspend Title III, Trump would effectively be punishing the Cuban people with a second embargo.
