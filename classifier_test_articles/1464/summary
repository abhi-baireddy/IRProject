The science of climate change is backed by examples of the damage mankind has caused all around us, every day and everywhere.
None of us are immune anymore; no matter where we live, no matter our political party.
The founding of Earth Day marked an important moment in time, a pivotal recognition of how precious and fragile and sacred our connection is to our natural world.
And on this Earth Day, I find myself searching for words to express my sense of urgency on behalf of our one and only home — to create yet another new awareness of those same responsibilities.
There should be no “climate change candidates” or “climate change voters” — because each one of us should put this issue at the top of our list of why we choose to elect who we do.
