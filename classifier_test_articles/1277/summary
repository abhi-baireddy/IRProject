The past decade has demonstrated that democratic change is not inevitable, but must be doggedly pursued by free societies.
At present, democracies are backsliding the world over, with threats to the rule of law, freedom of the press, and independent civil society growing ever more severe.
Rulers such as Viktor Orb√°n and Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power through democratic means, but moved swiftly and brutally to centralize power and stamp out opposition.
We must respond, clearly and without equivocation, in defense of our values and our democratic allies.
Our diplomats, military, and intelligence agencies must have the support and resources they need to help America lead the free world, and to anticipate and respond when Russia, China, and others seek to extend their reach and undermine democratic societies.
