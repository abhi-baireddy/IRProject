Musicians including rappers Snoop Dogg and The Game are calling for Fox News to dismiss host Laura Ingraham over comments she made about deceased rapper Nipsey Hussle.
Los Angeles-based rapper The Game said in an Instagram post that Fox News should fire her or risk losing "millions of viewers."
Ingraham last week appeared to mock one of rapper YG's hits songs, "FDT," that he released in tandem with Hussle in 2016.
The song includes the chorus, "F--- Donald Trump."
â€œNow, this dear artist recently released a song called FDT, 'F Donald Trump,'" Ingraham said on her nightly news program, before transitioning to a clip from a music video for the song.
