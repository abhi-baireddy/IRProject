Several new staffers have joined the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I­–Vt.
), including David Sirota, a columnist and political activist who once praised the economic policies of former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.
In a 2013 column for Salon, Sirota credited Chavez's "full-throated advocacy of socialism" with achieving an economic miracle.
It should go without saying, but there has been no economic miracle in Venezuela.
Sirota joins the Sanders campaign as a senior advisor and speechwriter.
