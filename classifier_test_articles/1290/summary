Andraya Yearwood — a 17-year-old biological male who identifies as female — took second-place earlier this month at Connecticut's indoor track girls' 55-meter sprint.
Terry Miller of Bloomfield High — who, like Yearwood, is transgender — won the event with a state record time of 6.95 seconds, the Associated Press reported.
In 2018, Miller crushed the competition in the girls' 100-meter and 200-meter dashes at the state meet with Yearwood coming in second in the 100.
"The facts show Glastonbury would be the state champion based on cisgender girls competing against cisgender girls," he told the outlet.
I always try to focus most on all of the positive encouragement that I have received from family, friends and supporters," Yearwood told the AP.
