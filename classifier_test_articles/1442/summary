On Wednesday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) will introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019, and already more than 100 House Democrats have said they support the bill.
The Veterans Affairsâ€™ health system and the Indian Health Services (IHS) also remain untouched.
But the Jayapal bill goes further, for example, by covering abortion services and by repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans any federal insurance program from covering abortion.
The bill also creates a Medicare Transition buy-in plan during the two-year period, which will be offered on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces.
Additionally, the bill uses existing policy ideas to tackle prescription drug costs and health care spending.
