Guerneville, a community of more than 4,500 people that is the largest town in the flood zone, was cut off from other areas by inundated roadways, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said on Twitter.
The Russian River rose to more than 45 feet (13.7 meters) late on Wednesday, well over flood stage of 32 feet (9.8 meters), Dugan said.
The flooding was the worst since 1995, when the Russian River rose to 48 feet (14.6 meters), said National Weather Service meteorologist Carolina Walbrun.
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office showed video on the department’s Facebook page of brown, muddy water rising above a road and flooding homes.
Sonoma County officials have asked California Governor Gavin Newsom to declare an emergency in the area to help with recovery.
