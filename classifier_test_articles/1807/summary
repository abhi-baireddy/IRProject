The leader, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, is the son of Imam Siraj Wahhaj, a former board member of the Council on American-Islamic Relations who is on record urging a violent overthrow of the "filthy" U.S. government.
The imam also has been called a spiritual adviser to jihad promoter and Bernie Sanders supporter Linda Sarsour.
The defendants, along with Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, are Jany Leveille, Hujrah Wahhaj, Subhanah Wahhaj and Lucas Morton.
During the raid, authorities found the remains of a 3-year-old disabled boy who later was identified as the son of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj.
The indictment accused Wahhaj of kidnapping the boy from his legal wife and transporting him from Georgia to New Mexico.
