The Fox anchor's take on the gay candidate was odd and, according to some, creepy.

Tuesday's edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight featured a segment on gay presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, and the results were bizarre.

Carlson spoke of Buttigieg as the Democrats' and the media's new golden boy, describing him in tones both ominous and, to some, lecherous.

"[The press and Democrats] want to consume him like a hearty stew," the archconservative host said. "Every last drop of Buttigieg. Yum."

The Twittersphere had reactions, of course.

This is not the first time Fox personalities sounded panicked over the South Bend, Ind., mayor.

“He speaks beautifully, he’s very nuanced, people need to look beyond that and actually look at the policies he supports,” Fox & Friends host Jedediah Bila said in the episode that aired Monday morning. “Because everyone’s saying, ‘Oh, maybe he’s a little more moderate.’ He’s actually not. He is a hard-left guy. He is a Medicare for All, Paris Climate Agreement, Green New Deal guy.”
