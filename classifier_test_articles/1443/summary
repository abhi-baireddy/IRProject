A new study and a new book both argue that the worst-case scenario for global warming would literally render the planet uninhabitable.
As of Feb. 26, it is number 11 on the Amazon best-seller list — a rarity for any climate book, but perhaps another sign of the growing interest in strong climate action.
AdvertisementMeanwhile, a new study published Monday in Nature Geoscience led by NASA senior scientist Tapio Schneider looks at one way that the worst-case scenario could get much worse.
First, the climate impacts that come from just one more degree Celsius of warming — for a total of 3.6°F (2°C) warming — will be catastrophic.
Second, the climate system has many feedback loops that threaten to accelerate warming if we trigger them.
