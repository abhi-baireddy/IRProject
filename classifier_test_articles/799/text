An off-duty Baltimore police officer fatally overdosed on heroin at a motel on Feb. 22, according to reports.

Officer Joseph Banks Jr., 25, was using drugs with his girlfriend at Tim’s Motel in Halethorpe when he began to sound like he was struggling to breathe. His girlfriend attempted to counteract his overdose with Narcan, the Baltimore Sun reported.

She called 911 after 3 a.m. Paramedics attempted CPR on Banks but were unable to revive him.

Police are still investigating the incident.

Banks was assigned to the juvenile booking unit but was suspended at the time of his death, according to WBAL. The Baltimore Police Department wouldn’t disclose the reason for his suspension.

City Councilman Brandon Scott said Banks’ death represents the need to pay more attention to the issue of drug use and overdoses.

“No one is far away from it. It’s at everyone’s doorstep, and it will continue to be that way until we get serious,” Scott said.
