They also hope that lab-grown silk, which is biodegradable, can ultimately replace materials like polyester that are made with petrochemicals and harm the environment.
A core of AMSilk’s business is selling its lab-grown silk gels and powders to cosmetics companies, which use silk additives to give skin products their glow and shampoo its shine.
“Spider silk,” he says, “has long been the holy grail of material innovation.”Reach Amy Feldman at afeldman@forbes.com.
