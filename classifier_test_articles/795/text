A freshman at the University of Buffalo died Wednesday — five days after being hospitalized in an alleged hazing incident, reports say.

Sebastian Serafin-Bazan, 18, of Port Chester in Westchester County, had gone into cardiac arrest early last Friday and was found unconscious on the front lawn of an off-campus fraternity house, according to WGRZ.

Police said the teen was rushed to the ER with a “serious medical condition believed to have resulted from the incident,” which occurred at a house associated with the Sigma Pi fraternity, according to WNBC. He had been in critical condition since last week.

University of Buffalo President Satish Tripathi said in a statement Wednesday: “Our hearts go out to Sebastian’s family for the devastating heartbreak they are experiencing. As we grieve Sebastian’s passing today and well beyond, it is my hope that each of us pauses to remind ourselves that we can only uphold our humanity by treating each other with dignity, compassion, and kindness.”

Details of the incident were unclear but the fraternity had hosted a party hours before the teen was found on the lawn, neighbors told WGRZ.

Initial reports from police said there were no drugs or alcohol in Serafin-Bazan’s system, The Buffalo News reported. Sources told the outlet that Bazan was recently treated for some sort of respiratory sickness.

The university suspended all Greek life at the college after Serafin-Bazan was hospitalized.
