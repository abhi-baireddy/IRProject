Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels famously said, “Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.”

Democrats stand by this tactic to this day.

On Wednesday former Trump attorney and criminal liar Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee.

Mr. Cohen told the committee that President Trump knew about the Hillary Clinton email dump in advance.

Michael Cohen: “Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the Wikileaks drop of emails.”

Of course, this was another lie by Michael Cohen.

Later today Wikileaks, once again, called out Cohen for lying under oath.

Wikileaks: Donald Trump’s estranged lawyer, Michael Cohen, who has been sentenced to three years in prison for lying to the FBI, will testify today before Congress that Trump knew about the Wikileaks release in July 2016 during a call with Roger Stone.

Wikileaks had already publicly announced its pending publications and has repeatedly denied speaking to Roger Stone.

This was just another Michael Cohen lie.

And Democrats keep repeating it hoping some day it will be true.

In fact the pending DNC email release was public knowledge.

Julian Assange announced the pending investigation in June.
