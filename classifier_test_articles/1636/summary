KIEV, Ukraine—News reports from Russian media over the weekend indicate that the hypersonic cruise missile highlighted in President Vladimir Putin's Feb. 20 state of the nation address is being contemplated for use in a first strike against targets in the continental United States.
Putin highlighted the NPO Mashinostroyeniya 3M22 Tsirkon missile.
Kiselyov said the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile could hit these targets in less than five minutes if launched from submarines.
It is unclear how realistic the statements of Putin or Kiselyov are—and how soon the Tsirkon missile could be prepared for deployment.
Dmitry Peskov, Russian presidential spokesman, sought to clarify Putin's comments following the Russian television report identifying targets.
