North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump both arrived in Vietnam on Tuesday, the eve of their second summit at which they will tackle how to implement a North Korean pledge to give up its nuclear weapons.
Kim arrived by train early in the day after a three-day, 3,000 km (1,850 mile) journey from his capital, Pyongyang, through China.
Their talks come eight months after the historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.
He got a red-carpet welcome with honor guard, military band and fluttering North Korean and Vietnamese flags.
â€œWith complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse.
