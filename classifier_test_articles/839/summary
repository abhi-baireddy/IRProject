Barr Has Considered Resigning Over Trump's RemarksEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/APAttorney General William Barr has told people close to him that he has considered resigning over his growing frustration with President Trump and the president's public statements about the Justice Department and its ongoing cases, an administration official tells NPR.
It is unclear whether the attorney general ever informed the president he was considering quitting, and for now, Barr remains at the department's helm.
In an interview with ABC News last week, Barr said the president's tweets and other remarks about the Justice Department make it "impossible" for him to do his job.
On Tuesday, Trump declared himself the "chief law enforcement officer of the country," a designation traditionally given the attorney general.
Trump conceded he does make Barr's job harder but said he has "total confidence" in the attorney general.
