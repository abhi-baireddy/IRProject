Consumers can bring them back to a Kohl’s store, with a receipt, and get a refund.
Again, these are very popular products and provide Kohl’s stores with a serious merchandising point of differentiation.

And it is most certainly the right store in the right market position to take advantage of others’ weaknesses.
But to credit the Amazon tie-in as the catalyst for all of this is to miss the point.
