Sanders held a town hall on Fox News Monday evening, breaking with the Democratic National Committee to appear on the conservative network.
But the audience at Sanders’ Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, town hall seemed enthused by a lot of what the Vermont Democratic Socialist had to say.
The crowd’s enthusiastic response was one of many moments of triumph for Sanders during the evening’s town hall.
During the town hall, Sanders led a call-and-response and rattled off numerous of his agenda items.
But if Sanders’ town hall is any indication, there’s still some opportunity for Democrats to have a positive experience on Fox News.
