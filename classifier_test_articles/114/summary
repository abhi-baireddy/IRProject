Top global scientists declined to declare the moratorium on gene editing heritable genes in humans called for by some experts, but warned it would be "irresponsible" to allow this in clinical practice and recommended initial steps for a global regulatory framework under the World Health Organization.
Why it matters: The global scientific and ethical community continues to be divided on whether there should be a complete moratorium on editing germline, or heritable, cells for now.
"We agree that it is irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with a clinical application of human germline editing," Hamburg added.
A central registry for both somatic (non-heritable) and germline genetic cell research is key for transparency and increasing accountability, Hamburg says.
The committee will establish various subcommittees to develop the standards, which must be inclusive of all types of cultures and technological advances.
