Nationally syndicated radio show host and National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch slammed the decision to honor CNN with an award for a televised town hall in which she was heckled, days after the mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school last year.
On Tuesday, CNN announced that it had received the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism for its “Parkland Town Hall,” held after the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.
The conservative pundit then shared several clips showing a hostile crowd booing and yelling “shame on you,” which she insisted did not “advance the conversation on gun control.”“This is what happened when the cameras turned off at CNN’s award-winning town hall.
She insisted that CNN had captured the entire exchange on camera and called on the network to release the footage.
In all, 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting.
