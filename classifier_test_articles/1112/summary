“I don’t feel lonely the same way.”Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another.

Having a place to go and people to see outside of school offers a reminder that they needn’t always feel that way.
“What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimate solution to loneliness lies in each of us,” Murthy says.
