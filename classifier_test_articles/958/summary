A California state senator wants to make his state the first in the nation to require warning labels on soda and other sugary drinks, a proposal called “misleading” by beverage industry officials.
The bill has the backing of the California Medical Association and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy.
The Latino Coalition for a Healthy California and the California Black Health Network also are sponsoring the legislation, citing the heavy consumption of sugary drinks and associated health problems among minorities.
The Vermont bill would require manufacturers to put warning labels on beverages that contain sugar or other artificial additives.
Monning said warning labels can make a difference in consumers' choices, particularly when paired with other public health campaigns warning of the dangers of obesity.
