bulletin sent to local law enforcement agencies on Tuesday identified the woman as Sol Pais, 18.
She was “infatuated” with the Columbine attack, the bulletin said, and had been “attempting to buy firearms.”Officials also released an image of Ms. Pais, and said she was approximately 5-foot-5, with brown hair.
She had recently traveled to Colorado, they said.
Ms. Pais’ parents reported her missing to local police on Monday, Detective Sergeant Marian Cruz, a spokeswoman for the Surfside Police Department, said on Wednesday.
That has been the only time police have been called to the family’s address, she added.
