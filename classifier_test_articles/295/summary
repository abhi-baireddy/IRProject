If this analysis is accurate, it looks likely that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause a rise in authoritarian-nationalism.
Like most observations of human behaviour, the link between greater disease risk and authoritarian-nationalism makes more sense when put into an evolutionary context.
It is therefore logical that we would have developed a response to higher disease risk that included becoming more politically conservative.
Even in the short-term, a sudden increase in disease risk is likely to turn the political tide away from liberalism towards authoritarian-nationalism.
Italy is probably the best place to start in considering how the COVID-19 pandemic might change European and global politics.
