Just days after claiming exoneration by the redacted special counsel report into Russian intervention in the 2016 election, President Trump is back to playing the victim.
For a second straight day, the president remained inside the White House — his relatively light schedule allowing ample time for television and Twitter.
“In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism,” Trump tweeted.
A Trump campaign advisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that Trump was “mad as hell” about fallout from the Mueller report and “frustrated” that Atty.
But the media’s continued focus on the Mueller report has offered Trump plenty of grist for his efforts to shift from a defensive posture into attack mode.
