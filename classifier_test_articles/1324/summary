The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994 to 2004) did nothing to alter gun violence trends.
Once the assault weapon was lifted, and the AR-15 became the most popular rifle in the country, gun violence continue to precipitously fall.
One: No matter how many times gun-controllers refer to the AR-15 as a “weapon of war” it will still be historically and mechanically incorrect.
And if any weapon that kills can be categorized as a “weapon of war” then the AR will have some stiff competition.
The District of Columbia v. Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens.” The AR-15 clearly meets this criteria.
