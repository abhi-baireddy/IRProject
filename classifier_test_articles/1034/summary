Warren has been critical of the electoral college before.
The Massachusetts senator said last year that President Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, despite Democrat Hillary Clinton winning 3 million more votes than him, is “not exactly the sign of a healthy democracy.”At a CNN town Hall Democratic Presidential Candidate Elizabeth Warren received a standing ovation when she said she favored eliminating the electoral college.
