Uber and Lyft have been criticized for not sufficiently evaluating their drivers and not prioritizing passenger safety, prompting some cities to place temporary bans or restrictions on the services.
Both companies say passenger safety is their top priority and have stood by their background-check processes.
In addition to asking the driver for your name, ask your driver for his or her name and look closely to make sure the photo on the app matches.
Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course.
Some Uber and Lyft vehicles have illuminated windshield icons called Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app.
