The first warrant obtained by the special counsel’s office was dated July 18, 2017, and sought Cohen’s emails.
A third warrant sought by Mueller’s office sought Cohen emails dating to June 2015.
Cohen was not a registered lobbyist, nor had he registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, authorities alleged.
The warrants show that federal agents sought information from Cohen’s Gmail account, as well as an account he set up for his legal and consulting work.
For instance, one warrant sought historical location data for two AT&T cellphones that agents alleged were used in the course of a campaign-finance scheme.
