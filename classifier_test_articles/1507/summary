CINCINNATI â€“ Federal prosecutors charged 60 physicians and pharmacists Wednesday with illegally handing out opioid prescriptions in what they say is the biggest crackdown of its kind in U.S. history.
Most of the defendants face charges of unlawful distribution of controlled substances involving prescription opioids.
Prescription opioid overdose deaths in Ohio dropped 28% since 2001 even as the synthetic fentanyl took over and overall overdose deaths kept rising.
Across America, almost 218,000 people died from overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids were five times higher in 2017 than in 1999.
