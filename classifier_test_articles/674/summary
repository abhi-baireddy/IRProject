Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.’s surprise settlement agreement Tuesday will result in a huge cash windfall for Qualcomm, and puts Apple on a faster path to 5G for the iPhone.
As part of their agreement, Apple will license future products from Qualcomm directly, instead of having its original equipment manufacturers license chips from the San Diego-based chip maker.
Intel shares shot up more than 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.
Several analysts speculated on Twitter that Intel’s plans to exit 5G modems may have propelled Apple’s settlement with Qualcomm.
Qualcomm countersued for payments that Apple withheld, leading to lawsuits around the world, as well as battles involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
