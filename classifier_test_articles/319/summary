DOJ Finalizes Rule to Collect DNA From Illegal Immigrants Detained in Federal CustodyThe Justice Department (DOJ) announced on Friday that it is finalizing a rule to collect DNA samples from illegal immigrants who are in federal custody.
The DOJ issued a final rule that would authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to collect DNA samples from immigrants who enter the country illegally and are being detained in federal custody.
The rule will allow the department to comply fully with a 2005 law, the DNA Fingerprint Act.
In January, CBP said it had initiated a small-scale pilot program to collect DNA from “certain individuals” in custody in two locations in order “to assess the operational impact of proposed regulatory changes.” The program will last 90 days.
He added that the rule “will help to enforce federal law with the use of science.”The DOJ said the DNA samples collected by DHS from the immigrants would be entered into the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).
