During a press spray with the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a reporter asked Donald Trump today why he was attacking Senator John McCain seven months after he's dead.
Here is his measured, sensitive and cogent response (/s):“I’m very unhappy that he didn’t repeal and replace ObamaCare, as you know.
And then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up.
And frankly had we even known that we would have gotten a vote because we could have gotten somebody else so I do think that’s disgraceful.
Plus there were other things I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
