But even if deep economic ties with China are a net positive for the U.S., should they ever really grow “too big to fail”?
Deep economic ties with China increase the likelihood that American politicians will be unable or unwilling to let the relationship fail.
It therefore believed that it wasn’t in Trump’s political interest to risk the economic relationship.
While Trump’s trade war may help course-correct the economic relationship, it will not eliminate this inherent vulnerability if it doesn’t reduce economic ties between the two countries.
To be sure, just because the U.S. should be concerned about a “too big to fail” problem doesn’t mean it should let the relationship with China fail entirely or sever economic ties.
