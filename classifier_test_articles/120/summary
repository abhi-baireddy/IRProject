A Democratic political group that has run ads questioning presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ electability—and his health—is now going after Sanders in Nevada.
Its thirty-second video spot questions Sanders’ ability to prevail in a general election contest and even raises concerns about the Vermont senator’s health.
“I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders’ health, considering he did have a heart attack,” a woman featured in the ad says.
Stacy Schusterman, a Tulsa oil and gas heiress, gave DMFI PAC nearly $1 million in December, according to FEC records.
DMFI’s plans for a Nevada offensive against Sanders were first reported by Mediaite.
