The budget airline’s entrance into the market could lead fares to the state to decrease by 30% across all carriers, an analysis published by Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani found.
The airline has said it will start offering low-cost flights to the islands by the end of 2019.
One-way fares to Hawaii currently hover around $200, the Morgan Stanley report said, but Southwest has hinted at entry-level fares of $100-140 from California.
Costs of inter-island flights will likely be more significantly affected than those between the continental U.S. and Hawaii, he said.
“When it comes to Hawaii, Southwest is in a unique position as the disruptor,” the report said.
