Turn on the TV these days and you are bound to catch one of the Cuomo brothers inveighing against the “selfish.” Chris Cuomo on CNN harangues any one who dares suggest that America restart its economy, while Andrew Cuomo delivers lectures on the importance of staying home lest one expose the elderly to illness.
