Democrats are seeking information from acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, after reports emerged last week that President Trump told McAleenan he would pardon him if he was put in jail for directing border agents to block entry to asylum seekers, which is illegal.
Trump reportedly had the exchange with McAleenan during a visit to the border in Calexico, California, when he was the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, just two days before Trump promoted him to fill the post left vacant by ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
The House Judiciary Committee is also seeking documents related to a March 21 meeting between Trump and Nielsen about reinstating Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy and shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border.
The deadline to respond to the committee’s request is April 30.
