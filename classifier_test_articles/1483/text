Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has already shared his expertise about religious freedom and “weapons of war,” so with that let’s turn the focus to systems of government. There’s plenty of talk about socialism vs. capitalism these days thanks to people like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but Buttigieg is here to explain why it’s such a hot topic:

Mayor Pete Buttigieg: "I think the reason we're having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down." https://t.co/TsjBqrq2gT pic.twitter.com/lp86oOkqEC — The Hill (@thehill) April 17, 2019

Riiiight.

As opposed to socialism, which has never let down anyone, ever, amirite https://t.co/ksu12WRRJH — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) April 17, 2019

According to Professor Thomas DiLorenzo and backed up by a book pubbed by Harvard University Press in 1999, the estimated number of people murdered by socialist regimes in the 20th century is nearly 100 million. And that doesn't touch the famines… But, yeah, great system. — Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) April 17, 2019

Yeah, socialist systems are straight-up utopias! Wait, maybe not.

LOL. And who hasn't been let down by Socialism, pray tell? https://t.co/ei9ASa9Aci — Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) April 17, 2019

While socialism has let everyone down 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/lvVkoJyxS0 — David I. Ramadan (@DavidIRamadan) April 17, 2019

Perhaps Mayor Pete should go to Venezuela and share that insight with the people there.

Capitalism has done more to eradicate global poverty than the UN, Red Cross, and any number of charities combined. Socialism, on the other hand, is yet to achieve a single long-lasting success. — Henry (@HMSPitts) April 17, 2019

Socialism however is so uplifting. pic.twitter.com/ny7H7974Ux — magiver (@magiver1001) April 17, 2019

Venezuela anyone ???? — TheUnderdog (@DWalkRed14) April 17, 2019

Capitalism is a system that allows the individual to succeed by their own work and choices. It cannot 'let anyone down.' Only the government interfering with its organic function does this. https://t.co/9jbPVXAZTK — Chad Felix Greene (@chadfelixg) April 17, 2019

I'd rather be let down than lowered into one of socialism's mass graves. https://t.co/rGmnB28sNj — Donny Ferguson 🗽 (@DonnyFerguson) April 17, 2019

Buttigieg made the comments on CNN’s “New Day,” and the fact that he said that without challenge or at least laughter from the host sums up plenty about the media.
