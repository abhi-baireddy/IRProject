Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has already shared his expertise about religious freedom and “weapons of war,” so with that let’s turn the focus to systems of government.
There’s plenty of talk about socialism vs. capitalism these days thanks to people like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but Buttigieg is here to explain why it’s such a hot topic:Mayor Pete Buttigieg: "I think the reason we're having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down."

Capitalism has done more to eradicate global poverty than the UN, Red Cross, and any number of charities combined.
