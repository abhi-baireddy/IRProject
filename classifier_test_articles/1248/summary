In Asian and Pacific Islander communities, anti-Blackness often manifests itself in two ways.
Through the glorification of whiteness and allyship with white people in our communities, anti-Blackness is perpetuated.
We are members of the Youth Working Committee of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance ( NQAPIA).
We can call for the abolition of unfair imprisonment and the accountability of renegade racist cops, advocate for reparations, show up for Black liberation, fight for Black undocumented immigrants and refugees, support Black owned businesses, and more.
