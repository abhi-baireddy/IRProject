Supreme Court Broadens The Government's Power To Detain Criminal ImmigrantsEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/APThe U.S. Supreme Court, narrowly divided along ideological lines, ruled Tuesday that the government may detain — without a hearing — legal immigrants long after they have served the sentences for crimes they committed.
Writing for the conservative majority, Justice Samuel Alito, said immigration law mandates the detention of "deportable criminal aliens" even if it is years later.
"As we have held time and again, an official's duties are better carried out late than never," he wrote.
Writing for the court's dissenting liberal wing, Justice Stephen Breyer warned that the ruling gives the government too much power.
The ACLU's Deputy Legal Director Cecilia Wang said Tuesday's ruling follows another decision last year that limited the rights of immigrants to bond hearings.
