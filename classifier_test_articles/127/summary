The trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell can now be reported after an Australian judge lifted a legal order that had prohibited coverage.
The sweeping ban, known as a suppression order, was handed down last May.
Some pre-trial hearings where Pell was swamped by media outside court were allowed to be reported.
Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited.
Other Australian journalists, however, voiced support for the suppression order, expressing concerns that publicity could influence a court outcome.
