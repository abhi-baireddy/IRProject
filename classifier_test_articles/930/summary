Governor Cuomo got it right when he admitted during a radio interview on February 22, that “progressives do not know how to govern.”Yes, all the New York progressives are guilty of that charge.
Cuomo’s other mistake: he believed that if the City’s progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed on, they could jam the Amazon deal through.
As for Amazon’s CEO, progressive Jeff Bezos, and his team that hammered out the deal: they were naive.
Dreading a 2020 Democratic Primary challenge from one of AOC’s confreres, Gianaris cast his lot with radical progressives and came out against Amazon.
The 1960s and 1970s tax and spend progressive experiment destroyed the city’s fiscal and economic base and drove out the city’s middle-class.
