“Sunlight destroys the virus quickly,” reads the briefing.
While the DHS describes the results as preliminary, they may eventually make their way into specific recommendations.
Simulated sunlight “rapidly killed the virus in aerosols,” the briefing says, while without that treatment, “no significant loss of virus was detected in 60 minutes.”The tests were performed on viral particles suspended in saliva.
While the lab results are new, scientists for many weeks have predicted, based on available data on the disease’s spread, that warmer, wetter climates would be less hospitable to the spread of the coronavirus.
An early analysis by scientists observed that the virus was spreading more slowly in countries with warmer climates.
