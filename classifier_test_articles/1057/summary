Along with arson attempts, typically—and rather with diabolical intent—altars are desecrated, crucifixes broken, statues mocked and/or beheaded, and the churches set aflame.
Thus in France, which has one of if not the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe, two churches are attacked every day.
The patterns between past and present attacks are virtually identical.
From the start, the intentional, widespread, and systematic targeting of churches and other Christian symbols prompted some to see Muslim invaders as motivated by a diabolical animus.
Police fought hard to restrain the man, who was described as suffering from a “visible psycho-physical crisis.”In other words, not much has changed: past and present, Muslims—motivated by what has long been deemed a diabolical animus—attacked and desecrated churches, crosses, and other Christian symbols.
