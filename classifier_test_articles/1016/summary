Is Attorney General William Barr trying to muzzle the Mueller Report – and does it matter?
Mueller team frustration is bubbling to surface.
However, the Barr Backtrack also indicates that Mr. Barr’s hat is in fact at worst a shade of gray.
However, I also remember that before Barr’s first ‘non-summary summary’ letter, sources thought that Barr and Mueller were on the same side, and were very surprised at the letter.
But if Rod Rosenstein in truth concurred with Barr, I do not believe that Rod Rosenstein is a ‘black hat’.
