Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence as Baltimore mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could be used to treat coronavirus patients.
The bill passed the state Senate on March 10 following a contentious back-and-forth between lawmakers.
Speaker of the House Adrienne Jones did not respond to a request for comment on why the bill was rejected.
Democrat state senator Will Smith Jr., who led the charge to remove the bill's mandatory minimums, also expressed discontent.
Violent crime spiked in the nation's deadliest large city in the last week, according to Baltimore police commissioner Michael Harrison.
