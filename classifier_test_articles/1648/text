The reelection campaigns for two freshman Democratic members of the House, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Jahana Hayes (D., Conn.), failed to disclose large contributions received from the campaign of fellow freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.).

The contributions were revealed in Omar's most recent filing, which disclosed transfers of $2,000 to both McBath and Hayes on March 27 of this year. Neither the filing from McBath nor from Hayes discloses the payments from their Minnesota colleague.

Reps. Lauren Underwood (D., Ill.) and Haley Stevens (D., Mich.) also received contributions from Omar, on March 27 and March 28, respectively. Both Underwood and Stevens included the contributions in their first quarter fundraising reports.

Underwood has already paid the price for her disclosure, with a national Republican group saying her acceptance of the donation serves as her acceptance of anti-Semitism.

"By accepting her campaign cash, Lauren Underwood has made clear the reason she won't condemn Ilhan Omar's vile anti-Semitic rhetoric is because she doesn't have a problem with it," said Carly Atchison, spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee

Reached by phone, the Hayes campaign said the contribution would be included in its next fundraising report, when it received the check from Omar's campaign. Spokeswoman Barbara Ellis said there was "absolutely not" an effort to hide the contribution.

The McBath campaign would not comment on why Omar's contribution wasn't in its fundraising report, but said the "report is accurate."

Campaigns generally attempt to squeeze as many contributions as possible into their coffers as each quarter comes to a close.

Omar raised over $800,000 in her first quarter as a congresswoman. Contributions flooded in following uproar caused by anti-Semitic remarks, according to a Washington Free Beacon investigation.
