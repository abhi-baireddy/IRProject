The reelection campaigns for two freshman Democratic members of the House, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Jahana Hayes (D., Conn.), failed to disclose large contributions received from the campaign of fellow freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.).
The contributions were revealed in Omar's most recent filing, which disclosed transfers of $2,000 to both McBath and Hayes on March 27 of this year.
Reps. Lauren Underwood (D., Ill.) and Haley Stevens (D., Mich.) also received contributions from Omar, on March 27 and March 28, respectively.
The McBath campaign would not comment on why Omar's contribution wasn't in its fundraising report, but said the "report is accurate."
Campaigns generally attempt to squeeze as many contributions as possible into their coffers as each quarter comes to a close.
