Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke was challenged by a college student during his campaign stop in Pennsylvania and the exchange was caught on video.
O'Rourke was campaigning at Pennsylvania State College when a student asked him a long and very insightful two-part question.
"Your campaign has not released the number of individual donors you have nor has it released the um average donation," she continued.
"Two-prong question," she asked.
The student mirrored from CNN's Anderson Cooper, who remarked that O'Rourke's campaign website had a lot of merchandise for sale, but didn't have much in the way of policy solutions.
