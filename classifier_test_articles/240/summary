Warren has promised to rid the political process of super PACs and dark money.
It now appears Warren has similarly reversed course on dark money.
When a dark money group purchased an ad in November supporting Warren in Iowa, the Massachusetts senator's campaign asked the group to halt its promotion of the senator.
Warren's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the new dark money effort to support her candidacy in Florida.
"The stakes are too high for millions of Floridians in 2020," said Andrea Mercado, executive director of New Florida Majority.
