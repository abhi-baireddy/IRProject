In a rare 59-to-41 vote against President Donald Trump, a dozen Senate Republicans joined with the minority Democrats to deny the president emergency powers to fund his wall.
The emergency move violates the Constitution, which gives Congress the power of the purse, these Republicans said.
Over the decades, the Congress has ceded more and more power to the presidency, said Senator Lee.
One of those bruised Republicans appears to have been Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who came out early against the emergency declaration.
He promises to veto their blocking of the national emergency declaration â€“ the first veto of his administration.
