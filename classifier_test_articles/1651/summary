Democratic representatives Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) both saw spikes in campaign contributions as they battled accusations of anti-Semitism, Federal Election Commission filings show.
Despite, or perhaps because of, the controversy over her comments, Omar and Tlaib (the latter regularly defends Omar's remarks), both saw spikes in campaign contributions, filings show.
Tlaib also experienced a drastic increase in campaign contributions at the same time as Omar.
Tlaib's campaign committee pulled in just $36,430 combined throughout January and February.
However, the congresswoman was the recipient of $206,817 in campaign contributions from individuals throughout March.
