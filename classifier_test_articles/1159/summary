Cuomo has long favored the new toll to generate revenue for an aging subway system that has been plagued by delays and closures.
The mayor, who had favored raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers rather than congestion pricing, said he was dropping his opposition.
“It’s a luxury to drive into Manhattan,” Cuomo said in a radio interview with WNYC on Tuesday, noting that most vehicles filling Manhattan each day drove in from another state.
A working group created by the state legislature last year recommended congestion pricing, saying it could generate $1 billion or more a year.
Taxis and other for-hire vehicles, which have been subject to a congestion surcharge of up to $2.75 for each ride in much of Manhattan since January, would not have to pay the additional congestion toll under Cuomo’s plan.
