If Malvo wins, he and others in cases involving certain crimes committed by minors could receive more lenient sentences.
But it said Supreme Court decisions since the shooting spree had found mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles were unconstitutional, and found this rule applied retroactively.

The Supreme Court will review that decision.
The top court will decide the case in its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2020.
