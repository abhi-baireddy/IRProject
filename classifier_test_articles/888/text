Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• In his two years in office, Donald J. Trump has become president of the United Base of America, making little effort to expand his coalition beyond the voters who propelled him to the White House in the first place. While other presidents sought to broaden their public support, Mr. Trump is heading into his re-election campaign sticking with his own tribe.

• Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would have forced an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, rejecting an appeal by lawmakers to his own deeply rooted instincts to withdraw the United States from bloody foreign conflicts.

• The Trump administration took another significant step to discourage migrants from seeking asylum, issuing an order that could keep thousands of them in jail indefinitely while they wait for a resolution of their asylum requests.
