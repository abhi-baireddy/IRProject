Bernie Sanders (who is now a millionaire) and his wife gave 3.4 percent of their income to charity.
Beto O'Rourke and his wife gave less than 1 percent.
Last night, The Washington Post reported that Beto O’Rourke released his tax returns for the past ten years.
As The Post noted, this makes Beto’s charitable giving less than one-third of 1 percent of his household income.
Bernie Sanders and his wife gave roughly 3 percent of their astonishingly large $566,000 income to charity in 2017.
