A Los Angeles train engineer was arrested Wednesday for allegedly derailing a locomotive at high speed near the Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy — believing a conspiracy theory that the government is covering up the vessel’s true purpose, federal authorities said.

Eduardo Moreno, 44, of San Pedro, is accused of ramming the locomotive through two barriers at the end of tracks Tuesday and coming to rest in a gravel lot about 250 yards from the hospital ship, according to the Department of Justice.

Nobody was injured. A nearby California Highway Patrol officer witnessed the crash.

The officer reported seeing “the train smash into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smash into a steel barrier, smash into a chain-link fence, slide through a parking lot, slide across another lot filled with gravel, and smash into a second chain-link fence.”

When confronted, Moreno allegedly told Los Angeles Port Police that he thought the Mercy was being used for something other than helping hospitals with the overflow of patients from hospitals dealing with coronavirus.

“You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching,” Moreno said, according to an arrest affidavit. “I had to. People don’t know what’s going on here. Now they will.”

He also allegedly told the FBI that he did it to “wake people up.”

He said he “thought that the ship was suspicious” and did not believe it was for “what they say it’s for,” according to the feds.

He was charged with one count of train-wrecking.
