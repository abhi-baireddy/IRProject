Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks about responses to the coronavirus pandemic at an event in Wilmington, Del., March 12, 2020.
(Carlos Barria/Reuters)New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said on Monday that the paper made a controversial change to its report on the sexual-assault allegation against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden after his campaign complained about the wording.
In an interview with Times media columnist Ben Smith, Baquet said the Biden campaign took issue with some of the phrasing in the paper’s report on former Senate staffer Tara Reade’s allegation that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993.
Advertisement“No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation,” the report read.
The Biden campaign has denied Reade’s allegation.
