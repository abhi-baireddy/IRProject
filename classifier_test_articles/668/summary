A tense exchange at a Capitol Hill hearing on credit reporting was generating buzz on Tuesday.
California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter kicked off the back-and-forth with the CEO of Equifax Inc., which is still engaged in legal battles tied to its 2017 data breach that affected about 148 million customers.
If you would so oblige me, I’d prefer not to,” said Equifax US:EFX CEO Mark Begor.
“We need to ask whether the system is so beyond repair that we need to completely rebuild the entire consumer credit reporting sector to truly put consumers first,” Waters said.
Equifax’s stock rose 0.5% on Tuesday, while TransUnion fell 1.3%, Experian’s U.S.-listed shares shed 1%, and the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%.
