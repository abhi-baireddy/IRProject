Subsequent reports in The Washington Post and elsewhere have suggested Jayu Joseon operates entirely on its own.
Jayu Joseon has yet to comment on the Madrid raid.
It previously promoted Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Unâ€™s rather more mellow, fun-loving and quite talkative older half-brother, to overthrow and replace him.
Suspicions that Kim Jong Nam might have wanted to seize power no doubt spurred Kim Jong Un to want to get him out of the way.
But Jayu Joseon is believed to have selected the North Korean embassy in Spain rather than the much larger North Korean embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, the center of North Korean operations in Europe, for two reasons.
