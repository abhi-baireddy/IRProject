On the day of Shen Yun, I developed chills and a fever, which I immediately decided to ignore in the interest of seeing Shen Yun.
The hosts started talking about a spiritual discipline called Falun Dafa, and then introduced a dance in which a beautiful young follower of Falun Dafa was kidnapped and imprisoned by Communists, who harvested her organs.
“We follow Dafa, the Great Way,” he began, singing about a Creator who saved mankind and made the world anew.
In January, I decided to double-check my woozy memories and buy a ticket to see Shen Yun again, at Lincoln Center.
Shen Yun saturation has reached such a ludicrous intensity that it has, in recent months, become a meme.
