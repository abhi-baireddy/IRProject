According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70 percent of white high school graduates in 2016 enrolled in college, and 58 percent of black high school graduates enrolled in college.
However, that year only 37 percent of white high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 70 percent of them.
Roughly 17 percent of black high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 58 percent of them.
Colleges also set up majors with little or no academic content so as to accommodate students with limited academic abilities.
Such majors often include the term “studies”: ethnic studies, cultural studies, gender studies, or American studies.
