Two leading House Democrats are calling on the Department of Homeland Security to immediately release most illegal immigrants from detention.
wrote acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and acting ICE Director Matthew Albence on Tuesday demanding the release of nonviolent immigrants in U.S. custody.
"The Department must take swift action to decrease the detainee population to prevent further spread of this disease," the lawmakers wrote.
"Releasing these non-violent detainees will prevent the unnecessary infection, sickness, and death of the men and women who work in these facilities and those who are detained."
ICE has already released at least 160 immigrants from detention who were at risk of contracting COVID-19.
