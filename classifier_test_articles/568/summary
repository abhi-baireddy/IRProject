Ford, in collaboration with GE Healthcare, will leverage the design of Airon Corp.'s FDA-cleared ventilator to produce in Michigan.
General Electric and Ford Motor will produce 50,000 ventilators for the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act for $336 million, federal officials announced Thursday.
The federal contract is the second for GE Healthcare regarding ventilator production.
GM also said it would not be profiting from its ventilator production.
Tom Westrick, vice president and chief quality officer of GE Healthcare, previously said the more "basic" ventilators are "well-suited to address the urgent needs during the Covid crisis."
