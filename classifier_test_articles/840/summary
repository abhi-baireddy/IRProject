While he has shared with Mr. Trump the view that the Chinese are not ready to make significant concessions, the president has continued to press for a deal.
Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, denied that Mr. Lighthizer had ever been frustrated with the president, saying that he and Mr. Trump were in complete agreement on the negotiating strategy with China.
“President Trump has never insisted that Ambassador Lighthizer make a deal with China and has instead told Ambassador Lighthizer he is interested only in making a ‘great deal’ with China that addresses structural issues,” Mr. Emerson added.
While many Republicans are eager for the trade war to end, they are warning the administration not to settle for a weak deal.
Democrats are already trying to outflank Mr. Trump on China and are gearing up to call any agreement that does not include structural changes a failure.
