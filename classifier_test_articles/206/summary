Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna, who led the charge on the resolution, slammed Trump over his veto.
"I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen."
After the resolution passed in the House, Khanna and a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers wrote a letter urging Trump to sign the resolution.
The president justified his veto by describing the Yemen resolution as a "dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities."
The passage of the Yemen resolution on Thursday stands as a rebuke of Trump's foreign policy, particularly his controversial reaction to Khashoggi's killing.
