Prosecutors are looking to put Felicity Huffman behind bars for four to 10 months after the Desperate Housewives actress pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud on April 8, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The actress, along with more than 30 other rich parents, was busted in a college admissions scandal for paying to help her daughter cheat her way into college.
Huffman paid $15,000 to a fake charity to help her child cheat on the SATs.
The law enforcement source also told CNN that the prosecutors’ call to go after a sentence of up to 10 months did not have anything to do with the star’s public apology.
If found guilty, they could get up to 20 years in prison for each charge, according to CNN.
