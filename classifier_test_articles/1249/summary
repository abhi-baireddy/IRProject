Alva Johnson is one of many to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct but the first to say it happened during the 2016 campaign.
Alva Johnson, who was a campaign staffer in 2016, told The Washington Post that Trump approached her as he was exiting an RV before a Tampa rally in August of that year.
He grabbed her hand and prepared to kiss her; she turned her head, so his lips hit the side of her mouth.
Johnson, who is black, also contends in the suit that the Trump campaign discriminated against her by paying her less than white men in similar jobs.
It took some time for her to decide on a lawyer to handle her case, she told the Post.
