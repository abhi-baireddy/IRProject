Raging Dominionist Michele Bachmann reared her head this weekend to warn listeners that the "deep state" was poised to take down the "most godly, bibical president in our lifetimes."
You know, those career employees of the "deep state."
"Not everyone is a part of the deep state, but you don’t need everyone," she warned.
Bachmann actually said this: “In my lifetime I have never seen a more biblical president than I have seen in Donald Trump."
“He is highly biblical and I would say to your listeners [that] we will, in all likelihood, never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime.
