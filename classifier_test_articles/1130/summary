Supervised release and parole are both forms of post-incarceration supervision by the United States Probation Office.
Parole is a form of custody served in the community under the supervision of the Probation Office and under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission.
Supervised release is an additional term of supervision that must be completed after a person completes his or her term of federal custody.
Persons on supervised release are supervised by the Probation Office, and remain under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court.
Violations of supervised release are handled by the District Court, and supervised releasees are entitled to a hearing before the District Court.
