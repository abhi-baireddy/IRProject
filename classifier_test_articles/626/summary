In a much-anticipated piece of political theater, seven leading pharmaceutical executives appeared before a powerful Senate committee Tuesday for a grilling from lawmakers who pledged a historic bipartisan effort to rein in skyrocketing prescription drug prices.
Voters in 2018 punished the GOP for the party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, and some Republicans hope that a successful effort to tackle prescription drug prices would win some of them back.
AdvertisementDemocrats, for their part, feel like they need to deliver on their own midterm election pledge to reduce drug costs.
And as expected, drug executives largely dodged responsibility for high prices, blaming insurers while emphasizing their commitment to developing life-saving therapies.
“Senate Republicans are now saying the right things, voicing outrage over drug pricing,” said John Rother, a former longtime executive with the AARP who now heads the reform advocacy group National Coalition on Health Care.
