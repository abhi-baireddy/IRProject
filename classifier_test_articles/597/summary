O’Rourke led a protest against President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall in El Paso last month.
“I’m really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents,” O’Rourke said in a text to KTSM , Wednesday night.
In the latter half of the 2000s, a bloody drug-cartel war was raging just across the border from El Paso in Juarez, Mexico.
If those volunteers respond with a barrage of text messages that generate new volunteers and add up to big money, O’Rourke is in the hunt.
(He was born Robert O’Rourke to his Irish-American family, but was nicknamed Beto at birth — Beto being a common shortening of Robert in El Paso.)
