Yet, despite what I know, I still don’t think much about farm workers.
For the last few weeks, I’ve thought about food almost as much as Del Bosque does.
Del Bosque reminds me that, according to some estimates, as many as 70 to 80 percent of farm workers are undocumented.
If they don’t work, they don’t eat.
I asked Del Bosque what he hoped people would learn from all this about farm workers.
