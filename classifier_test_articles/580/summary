BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care.
And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness.
Not every patient in intensive care is ventilated, but around two-thirds are within 24 hours of admission with Covid-19.
Asked whether that was appropriate, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson would "take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor".
