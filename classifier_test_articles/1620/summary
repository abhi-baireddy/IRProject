Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ plan to cap her staffers' salaries benefits entry-level staffers but poses a risk that the freshman New York Democrat might suffer high turnover, congressional staffing experts say.
"She is hurting herself," said former Rep. Dan Lungren, who was the head of the Committee on House Administration responsible for setting the budget for House members' offices.
“I don’t think you always put the burden on the bottom,” said Trent, referring to entry-level congressional staff positions that typically pay around $30,000.
Ocasio-Cortez’ pay scale would especially affect those in lower- and higher-end staff positions.
Senior-level congressional positions pay significantly higher than entry-level positions as they are meant to retain highly skilled and experienced personnel, while lower-paid positions are usually considered stepping-stones to higher-paying jobs for people with more experience.
