The United States, which now has the largest outbreak in the world, was very late to the testing game.
In comparison, the United States has still tested only about 0.2 percent of its population, based on these figures.
Hanage added in an email that when it comes to the United States tests that have been conducted, â€œa huge proportion of the few tests that have been run have been from N.Y.
ADAnd both testing and hospitalization numbers are likely to be made up of people who came in for testing or complaining of symptoms.
That means that so far Germany has tested well over half a percent of its population, considerably more than the United States has done.
