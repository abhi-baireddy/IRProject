Actress-turned-activist Rose McGowen eviscerated her former "Charmed" co-star Alyssa Milano for her continued support for former Vice President Joe Biden amid a newly surfaced sexual assault accusation.
But in late March, Reade told a far more graphic account, with different and more serious details, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault.
There, Reade claimed that in 1993, she was asked by a more senior member of Biden’s staff to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question.
The Biden campaign vehemently denied Reade's allegation.
We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false,” Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to Fox News.
