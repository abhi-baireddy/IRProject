The strong bond between President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro can be traced to the values they share, Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti said Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, Trump offered a warm welcome to Bolsonaro in a White House meeting that not only heavily focused on the self-destruction of Venezuela but also on Trump floating the idea of Brazil joining NATO.
During Tuesday's "Special Report" All-Star panel, Continetti -- along with Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York and Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter -- weighed on Trump’s alliance with Bolsonaro and their joint news conference.
Trump once again framing the 2020 debate in terms of socialism versus capitalism.
This is an argument that Bolsonaro can understand as well as Trump.”
