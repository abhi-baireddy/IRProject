March 2020 showed the lowest monthly atmospheric nitrogen dioxide levels of any March on record.
Air pollution has dropped by 30% in the big cities of the Northeast over the past few weeks as the coronavirus pandemic worsened and people stayed home, according to NASA satellite data.
With people staying home and not driving their cars, air pollution has declined in a big way.
Last month, pollution reductions were also noted in countries hit hard by the coronavirus, including China and Italy.
“We all have this hunch about how air pollution has changed, the longer this goes on, the more we will see,” NASA air pollution specialist Ryan Stauffer told The Washington Post last week.
