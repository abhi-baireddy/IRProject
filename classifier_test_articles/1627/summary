GOP congressman Gary Palmer blasted Ilhan Omar's "anti-Semitic ... bigotry" by highlighting a Jewish CIA officer and former Green Beret who was killed on a peacekeeping mission in her native Somalia.
"Another name is worth recognition and remembrance, especially among Somali refugees: Lawrence Freedman," Palmer wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.
"Thousands of Somali refugees who now live in Ms. Omar's district had their freedom and security paid for with the blood of American soldiers â€” 22 of them, including Freedman."
Palmer cited Freedman as an example because he was Jewish-American and because, he wrote, Omar is guilty of "anti-Semitic statements" and "bigotry."
Freedman had retired from the Army in 1990 and joined the CIA, which sent him to Somalia.
