Planetary scientist William McKinnon, a co-investigator on the mission, compared the two-part body to “a meatball attached to a pancake."

The New Horizons spacecraft is already speeding away from MU69, an inhabitant of a dark and distant region called the Kuiper belt that surrounds the solar system beyond Neptune.
In a solar system where many objects were born out of catastrophic cataclysms, this gentle formation process is intriguing, he added.
