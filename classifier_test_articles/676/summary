CLOSE The 2020 election is nearing and with that, comes the caucuses and primary elections.
The video above explains the differences between primaries and caucuses, taking a closer look at Iowa's Democratic caucus to demonstrate how the process works.
New Hampshire, which will hold its 2020 primary on Tuesday, Feb. 11, eight days after Iowa's caucuses, is the "first-in-the-nation primary state."
How do the Democratic and Republican caucuses work in Iowa?
If Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus system became too similar to a primary, New Hampshire could, by New Hampshire state law, leapfrog us in line, becoming the first state in the nation to weigh in on the presidential race.
