BlackRock Inc. BLK, +3.89% Chief Exeuctive Larry Fink says that with stocks knocking on the door of records, a surge to the upside appears more likely than a market collapse.
“Despite where the markets are in equities, we have not seen money being put to work,” Fink said.
Melt-ups are often followed by sharp market setbacks.
Fink said the dovishness of central bankers creates a shortage of “good assets,” which could serve as a trigger for a global melt-up in equity prices.
BlackRock on Tuesday reported a fall in first-quarter profit due to a price-war that continues to ripple across the asset-management industry.
