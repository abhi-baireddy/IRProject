Last week the New York Attorney General announced that she was hitting Donald Trump with millions of dollars in fines over his abuse of the Trump Foundation nonprofit charity.
This included $2.8 million in restitution and another $5.6 million in penalties.
Today itâ€™s being reported that Donald Trump sold one of his New York City condos back on March 8th.
Trump was also hit with the separate $5.6 million fine, in addition to the $2.8 million fine.
Of course Donald Trump will likely try to fight these fines in court.
