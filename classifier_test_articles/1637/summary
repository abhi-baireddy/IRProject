Pro-life groups are criticizing former representative Robert Francis O'Rourke after he endorsed late-term abortion at an Ohio campaign rally.
O'Rourke said he supports abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy when asked about the issue on Monday evening.
The 2016 Democratic platform endorsed taxpayer-funded abortion for all Americans—a departure from previous years—but stopped short of opposing limits to late-term abortion.
"Democrats are in a race to the bottom on abortion," Schilling said.
Late-term abortion has become a defining issue for Democratic presidential hopefuls in the wake of New York passing legislation that allows abortion up until the point of birth.
