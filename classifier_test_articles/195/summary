Fox News filed a motion Tuesday to dismiss the lawsuit filed by a Washington nonprofit organization over the network’s coverage of the novel coronavirus.
The Washington League for Transparency and Ethics (WASHLITE) filed a consumer protection and emotional distress lawsuit against Fox News April 2.
“Under the First Amendment and state law, the truth or falsity of this type of speech must be resolved through free and open debate in the marketplace of ideas—not through burdensome litigation seeking to impose legal penalties on political statements that a jury might deem ‘false’ or ‘outrageous.’”Fox News’s argument is that “the First Amendment protects” the network’s speech.
It also notes that WASHLITE “fails to state a claim under Washington law” and “fails to state a claim for the tort of outrage.”The network explains that the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), cited by WASHLITE in its lawsuit, “does not apply to political commentary.”“But the only deception here is in the Complaint [WASHLITE],” the network’s motion to dismiss reads.
“Fox’s opinion hosts have never described the Coronavirus as a ‘hoax’ or a ‘conspiracy,’ but instead used those terms to comment on efforts to exploit the pandemic for political points.”“Regardless, the claims here are frivolous because the statements at issue are core political speech on matters of public concern.”
