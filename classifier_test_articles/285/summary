Gillibrand pushes for ‘commonsense’ gun reforms on the campaign trail … many of which we already haveAt a campaign stop late last week in New Hampshire, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said a lot of things about gun laws and legislation that were just plain not true.
The reason why we’ve been unable to pass any commonsense gun reform ever is because the NRA is largely funded by the gun manufacturers … And, unfortunately, because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales, they oppose the commonsense reform that can save lives.
Gillibrand: Because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales…they want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart.
Every single retail transaction, i.e., the kinds of transactions that result directly in gun manufacturer profits, requires a federal background check.
The “universal” background check legislation currently passed by the Democratic House would only extend background check requirements to transactions between private individuals.
