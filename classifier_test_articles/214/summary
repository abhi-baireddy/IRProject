Ohio lawmakers could soon consider legislation that would move the state’s 2020 primary from March to May and potentially weaken a presidential bid by the state’s senior senator, Sherrod Brown.
Brown, who is weighing a campaign, would join a large field and could benefit from a strong Ohio showing early on the primary calendar.
Under current Ohio law, the state’s 2020 primary would be March 10.
Ohio has been holding March presidential primaries — often in the Super Tuesday mix with other states — since 1996.
But Cera, a veteran Ohio lawmaker, also remembers 1984, the last time the state had a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate: then-senator John Glenn.
