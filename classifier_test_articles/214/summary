The media has just discovered that the coronavirus is far more deadly to blacks and Latinos than to whites.
It is, as the Kerner Commission concluded, the direct result of public policy and private prejudice.
If the president or Congress were serious, they would create a new Kerner Commission, an independent commission to document the structures of racism and discrimination built into our public policies.
If they fail to act, governors could create similar investigations for their own states, and act upon the recommendations.
The coronavirus only serves to once more draw attention to the terrible human costs of that failure.
