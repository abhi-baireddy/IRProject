Notwithstanding the armada the government sent to fetch Stone, a Florida federal judge, who noted that a phone call to Stone's lawyers would have produced him, released Stone without the obligation of posting bail.
Last fall, he was convicted on all counts, and the trial judge unconstitutionally prevented him from speaking publicly.
The prosecutors recommended a 7- to 9-year sentence to the trial judge.
The prosecution's numbers were the product of numerous subjective evaluations of the facts in Stone's case and in his personal background.
All this has created a monstrous headache for the trial judge, but the judiciary has the tools with which to address this.
