Donald Trump Jr. hit out at former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday claiming 'enough is enough' following a gaffe in which the Democratic candidate said his late son Beau was the United States Attorney General.
Biden accidentally gave Beau the job promotion on Thursday while speaking at CNN town hall event.
Beau Biden was the Attorney General of Delaware, not of the United States.
'FACT CHECK FOR JOE BIDEN: Your son was not the "Attorney General of the United States",' wrote Steve Guest, the Republican Party's Rapid Response Director.
Beau Biden served as Attorney General of Delaware from 2006 until 2015.
