“President” Donald Trump has gone back and forth about his feelings regarding the release of the Mueller report.
Recently he’s resumed his previous attacks on Mueller’s team and the report itself.
When William Barr issued his ridiculous “summary” of Mueller’s report, Trump wore out the terms “no collusion” and “no obstruction.” He even complimented Mueller’s findings, calling them the result of “great intelligence.” Mueller’s actual report found no such thing.
According to Karl, Trump’s firing of Comey, his anger at and eventual firing of Sessions for recusing himself, and Trump’s purported attempts to fire Mueller all point toward his guilt on obstruction.
While this all sounds damning for Trump, Karl reports that attorneys for “President” Trump are preparing a rebuttal to the report, making it plausible that they have, at the very least, been briefed about the report.
