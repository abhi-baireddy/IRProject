The French government will be launching a contest to design a new spire for the Notre Dame Cathedral after the old one was destroyed in a fire.
On Monday, the Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire.
While much of the building's stone structure survived, the wooden roof and spire were destroyed and the rest of the building suffered serious damage.
French Prime Minister Ã‰douard Philippe said he thought the contest could give Notre Dame "a spire suited to the techniques and challenges of our time."
He also suggested that the contest could result in the building being reconstructed without a spire at all.
