Video obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request shows a security guard grab AP reporter Ellen Knickmeyer by the shoulders on May 22 and shove her out of the agency’s lobby.
A handful of reporters from other media organizations were also allowed into the meeting room, which had several empty seats at the time.
She said she showed up anyway, and was told by a security guard that she couldn’t enter.
After security told her “we can make you get out,” Knickmeyer said she took out her phone to record what was happening.
The video shows a security guard grabbed her shoulders from behind and pushed her out the door.
