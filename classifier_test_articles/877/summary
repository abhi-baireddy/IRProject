The legal travails of President Bill Clinton may soon haunt President Trump.
A New York appeals court on Thursday ruled that Mr. Trump, like Mr. Clinton before him, is not protected by the presidency from answering civil charges.
The five-judge panel in Manhattan said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause does not bar state courts from hearing claims over “alleged unofficial misconduct” — that is, claims of improper or illegal action before a president took office.
A former contestant on Mr. Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice,” Summer Zervos went public during the 2016 campaign with accusations that Mr. Trump kissed and groped her without her consent.
She is suing the president for defaming her shortly after she came forward, calling her charges a “hoax.” She filed her suit days before Mr. Trump took the oath of office.
