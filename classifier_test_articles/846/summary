Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told CNN Business that all Netflix productions around the world have been shut down.
But Sarandos said Netflix subscribers can still expect new content to appear on the platform for at least the next few months.
But the streaming site may run out of original content to post toward the end of the year if production can’t resume.
Sarandos also said Netflix will be paying all crews their full salaries for two weeks following the production shutdown.
The Hollywood Reporter reports that as of Friday, Netflix has set up a $100 million relief fund for production crews and professionals without jobs.
