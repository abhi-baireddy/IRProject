The 35-page opinion issued on Tuesday also credited the companies’ commitment to avoid content blackouts in negotiations with rival distributors and called the challenges to the lower court “unpersuasive”.
AT&T had agreed last year to hold back from integrating Time Warner fully until the conclusion of the DoJ’s appeal, or February 28, whichever came first.
“We are grateful that the court of appeals considered our objections to the district court opinion.
The department has no plans to seek further review,” said Jeremy Edwards, a justice department spokesperson.
The government’s complaints about Judge Leon’s treatment of its economic theories were “largely irrelevant,” at least for now, as a result of AT&T’s seven-year pledge to ensure that rival distributors are not blocked from accessing Time Warner content during contract disputes.
