"Most institutions need somewhere around a six-week to two-month runway to ... be able to be open," said Barbara Mistick, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
"There is concern about bringing students back to campus too soon and perhaps having an outbreak."
While that's a general concern for schools, businesses and any place where large numbers of people can gather, colleges and universities have extra considerations, Mistick said.
In a frame from a video call, Barbara Mistick talks about how colleges are looking ahead to the 2020-21 academic year.
"Most institutions have students that are coming from all sorts of different states around the country," she said.
