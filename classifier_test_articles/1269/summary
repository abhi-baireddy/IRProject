Frank Mora does a fine job considering the risks and potential pitfalls of different kinds of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela.
Such an engagement would cost American lives and money and hurt the United States’ standing in Latin America.
In addition to being a prolonged, costly undertaking, intervention in Venezuela would be illegal as well as unwise.
Above all, the war would be completely unnecessary and not make the United States the slightest bit more secure.
Congress and the public need to make clear that they don’t support and won’t tolerate war with Venezuela.
