President Trump’s nomination of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain (full disclosure, both are friends and Moore an occasional professional colleague) to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve has become something of a cause célèbre in Washington.
A second knock on Moore and Cain is that they lack the professionalism requisite to serve.
It is not wrong of the president to express concern that monetary policy is too tight and strangling economic growth.
Confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain would not undermine the Fed’s independence.
The United States Senate should not flinch from confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board.
