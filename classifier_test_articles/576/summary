Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) called out Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) after he claimed that the National Rifle Association (NRA) called for violence against Democratic lawmakers.
The congressman hopped on Twitter and claimed that the article was calling for violence against anti-gun legislators.
This is a call for violence by the @NRA against @GabbyGiffords, who was nearly killed by gunfire and @SpeakerPelosi, the most powerful legislator in America.
