â€‹Nearly 90 percent of voters approved of granting President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi more parliamentary power.
SHOW TRANSCRIPTEgyptian voters have approved constitutional amendments to let the country's president remain in power for at least another decade.
Election officials said Tuesday nearly 90 percent of voters approved of granting President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi more parliamentary power, including potentially letting him stay in office until 2030.
Other changes include granting Sissi the power to appoint top judicial officials and giving military courts wider jurisdiction in trying civilians.
Sissi overwhelmingly won re-election last year, which wasn't too surprising given that several potential rivals were either jailed or pressured to bow out of the race.
