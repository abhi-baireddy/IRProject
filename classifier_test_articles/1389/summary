Although the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave’s victory was in many ways his victory.
That night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage’s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames.
Banks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own.
Banks’s 2016 memoir, “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London.
Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people’s choice and must be enforced.
