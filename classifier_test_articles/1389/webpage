The shocking result of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union had just been announced: [Leave had won](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit).\n\nBanks, an entrepreneur whose fortune comes primarily from owning insurance companies, had financed and directed the most aggressive wing of the Leave campaign, Leave.EU, and he had given or loaned a total of thirteen million dollars to various anti-E.U. causes. In Britain, where campaign-spending laws have historically been stringent, and donations modest by American standards, Banks’s contributions are thought to constitute the largest sum ever donated by an individual to a political campaign. Banks, who is fifty-two, is short and moonfaced, and often talks with a mischievous half smile; Wigmore, a former Conservative Party operative who serves as Banks’s communications chief, also fifty-two, has floppy black hair and a chaotic manner. Virtually inseparable, and prone to boyish humor, they refer to each other as Banksy and Wiggy.\n\nAlthough the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers [Boris Johnson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson) and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave’s victory was in many ways *his* victory. He had given considerable financial support to [Nigel Farage](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nigel-farage), the sharp-tongued Euroskeptic, which had allowed Farage to remain at the center of the Brexit debate. Many experts also believed that the rambunctious Leave.EU campaign—which stoked fears of uncontrolled immigration—had roused voters who had been unmoved by the more technocratic messages of Vote Leave. A typical Leave.EU post on Facebook warned voters that “*immigration without assimilation equals invasion.*{: .small}” A post about the dangers of “free movement” within the E.U. was accompanied by a photograph of ticking explosives.\n\nThat night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage’s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames. Farage called the referendum “a victory for ordinary people,” adding, “We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption, and deceit.” He concluded, “Let June the twenty-third go down in our history as our Independence Day\\!”\n\nShortly after 5 *a.m*{: .small}., Banks and Wigmore took the champagne and headed for a friend’s apartment, to shower and change before making media appearances. On the way, they spotted an old man, in a tattered Barbour jacket, attempting to withdraw large sums of money from an A.T.M. The old man recognized them. He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next.\n\nBanks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such “lies.” A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity. Laughing, they assured the man that nothing of the sort would happen. Banks handed him the bottle of champagne, and urged him to celebrate. As Banks recalled it, “He genuinely thought the world was going to come to an end\\!”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks told me this story, alongside Wigmore, on a rainy November afternoon two and a half years later, at 5 Hertford Street—a private member’s club, in Mayfair, where male guests are required to wear a formal jacket. The Brexit project that they had so ardently supported had left the U.K. in a state of panic. The government of Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/theresa-may) had almost imploded several times. The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain’s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn’t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as “no deal,” would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine.\n\nThis outcome was Banks’s preferred result. “No deal means we *leave*,” he told me at the club.\n\nBanks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency—Britain’s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners’ money in electoral campaigns. “A number of criminal offences may have been committed,” the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks’s and Bilney’s stories had “changed over time,” and that what they told the commission was “not consistent” with company records. (Bilney says that this “evolvement of response” can be ascribed to the commission’s failure to understand “our business structures.”)\n\nA sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency’s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote. Although President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin) has claimed that Russia was ambivalent about the Brexit referendum, he recently pressed May to “fulfill the will” of the British people and rule out a second referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U.—which, polls suggest, would lead to a narrow win for Remain. Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin’s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea.\n\nAccording to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a “regime-change agenda” around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin’s regime might be targeted next. “Russia felt they needed to push back hard,” Weiss told me. “They wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that’s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and—I think—their support of Brexit fits in.”\n\nBanks’s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent “ambassador” for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a “friend and business partner,” made much of his money by investing in Russia. (A representative for Mellon denied that Mellon has had a “close business or professional relationship” with Banks.) Banks’s 2016 memoir, “[The Bad Boys of Brexit](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum/dp/1785901826/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=),” acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London. Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency’s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks’s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, “There are still so many questions unanswered about Banks—where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07]\n\n+++\n\nThe government of the U.K. has been strikingly muted in its response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats. According to various reports, in the early months of 2016, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, she refused a request by British intelligence services to investigate Banks’s conduct. Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports—including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people’s choice and must be enforced. Given the tensions surrounding the referendum, she is unlikely to invite further probes into the financial background of one of the Leave campaign’s key players. Doing so would be tantamount to using a grenade in a pub brawl.\n\nIn Parliament, however, both Labour and Conservative members have repeatedly questioned whether Banks’s dealings with the Russians in the lead-up to the referendum amounted to an influence campaign by a foreign power. In November, 2018, when the National Crime Agency investigation was announced, David Lammy, a Labour M.P., demanded that Britain’s departure from the E.U. be “put on hold until we know the extent of these crimes against our democracy.” Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, has called for a “[Mueller-style inquiry](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation)” into whether the “referendum result was stolen.” The Conservative M.P. Damian Collins has demanded a broader inquiry into Russian interference in British affairs. In an interview at his office in the Houses of Parliament, he told me that he had serious concerns about the source of Banks’s funds. “The reason the questions persist is that he seems to own a number of businesses that don’t make any money,” Collins said. “There’s never really been a clear explanation from him about the funding of these campaigns.”\n\nBanks recently sent Collins’s constituents a letter calling him a “disgrace” and a “snake in the grass.” In an op-ed, Collins responded that he would not be cowed by Banks’s “bullyboy tactics.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks’s affairs have also fallen under scrutiny outside the U.K. Banks, Wigmore, and Farage came to public attention in the U.S. shortly after the 2016 elections, when they were photographed with President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) outside his apartment in Trump Tower. A few days later, in London, Banks and Wigmore again met with the Russian Ambassador, recounting their meeting with Trump and passing on contact details for members of Trump’s transition team. The British Web site Open Democracy has also reported that, as early as October, 2015, Banks asked [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), who later became the head of Trump’s campaign, for help in exploring possible sources of American funding for Leave.EU. (Banks says that this effort never progressed.)\n\nLate last year, [e-mails leaked to the *Observer*](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/17/arron-banks-emails-steve-bannon-brexit-campaign-funds) revealed that Leave.EU had misrepresented to British investigators the extent of its ties to Cambridge Analytica, the now disgraced and insolvent British data firm funded by the American political donor [Robert Mercer](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mercer) to microtarget voters. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks flatly states that Leave.EU had “hired Cambridge Analytica.” He later insisted that his group had held only “preliminary discussions” with the firm, and never paid it anything; he repeated this claim to me. But the leaked e-mails show that discussions extended into 2016—beyond what Banks had previously admitted. Bannon is copied on some of these e-mails; in one of them, Banks writes that he “would like to get CA on the team, maybe look at the first cut of the data.” When news of the e-mails broke, Collins called them evidence of “direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump,” and redoubled his campaign to establish a broad-ranging inquiry.\n\n[Adam Schiff](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/adam-schiff), the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that there were “parallels and interconnections in abundance” between the apparent Russian efforts to influence Brexit and the well-documented, and possibly decisive, Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election. He described Putin’s ambassadors in D.C. and in London as conduits of “malign influence.” According to an American lawyer with knowledge of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Banks and Farage have become persons of interest in that inquiry. (This is “bollocks,” Wigmore said.)\n\nIn December, two South African intelligence officials confirmed to me that Banks, who owns an array of businesses in southern Africa, including several diamond mines, had been the subject of two investigations by the Hawks, South Africa’s version of the F.B.I. The first case involved looking into whether Banks used his diamond mines in South Africa to launder stones from other parts of Africa—a process known as “salting the mines.” The second explored whether Banks, or people close to him, acquired automatic weapons without a license during a period of political upheaval in Lesotho; this investigation was opened by a branch of the Hawks known as Crimes Against the State.\n\n-=-=-=-\nConsidering all these investigations, Banks and Wigmore were in oddly high spirits when we met. Banks drank white wine; Wigmore, gin-and-tonic. They frequently reduced each other to gales of laughter with a joke or a reminiscence, and they found it both surreal and amusing to be figures of suspicion on three continents. A few days before the meeting, Wigmore sent me a text about the lives that he and Banks had been leading since the Brexit vote: “It’s a film a book and a thriller rolled into one lol.” He appended to the message the crying-laughing-face emoji.\n\nBanks dismissed much of the reporting about him as overheated Remainer fantasy—the product of journalists and media proprietors who had been “driven crazy by Brexit.” This argument echoes Trump’s claim that Americans who express concerns about his campaign’s communications with Russian officials are just displacing their rage over his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Banks said that he’d given money to a campaign in an entirely legal way, and now he was being punished for having been effective. All the criminal investigations were similarly motivated by politics. One could not trust the Electoral Commission to act fairly when it referred him to the National Crime Agency, he said, because the commission was filled with Remain supporters. Brexit itself was at risk, Banks warned me, because most M.P.s were Remainers, as were many powerful people outside Parliament.\n\nFor all his bonhomie, there was a sinister aspect to Banks’s embattled outlook. Leave.EU’s social-media feed, which is overseen by Banks, often parroted the alt-right view that liberal global élites exert an outsized sway over politics and the media. Two recent posts by Leave.EU had featured images of the financier [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros), a target of anti-Semitic hatred and a focus of right-wing conspiracy theories. In one post, Soros was pictured as a puppet master controlling Tony Blair; the image echoed a Nazi propaganda poster of the nineteen-forties, in which a Jewish man controls Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin with strings.\n\nDuring our meeting, Banks spoke scathingly of the Web site Open Democracy, which has published detailed articles on Banks’s business dealings and political activities. The site is partly funded by Soros. In October, three days after a pipe bomb was discovered at Soros’s house in Connecticut, Banks tweeted, “I suppose there are good Jews and bad Jews, then George Soros.”\n\nIn our conversations, it was obvious that Banks read widely—including publications that he professes to hate, such as the liberal *Financial Times*—and that he was capable of nuanced political thought. For instance, he was able to disentangle his support of British unionism—the idea that England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should not break apart—from his opposition to the E.U., an argument that some right-wing M.P.s might have struggled with. At other times, he came across as willfully obtuse, the product of an alt-right echo chamber. He used Trumpian language about the nefarious motives of the “deep state.” In Banks’s mind, there was no doubt that important news reached the public only at times most conducive to the interests of powerful but unseen forces. At one point in our conversation, Banks suggested that behind-the-scenes figures in Britain had deliberately provoked American anxieties about the 2016 election. “Part of the whole Trump-Russia thing, and also with the [Steele dossier](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier), it’s absolutely the case that some of those rumors came out of the British intelligence services,” he told me. “I think there are going to be revelations along that line.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks first came to national attention in Britain in October, 2014, when he announced a large donation to the U.K. Independence Party, or *ukip*{: .small}, which was led by Nigel Farage at the time. Until then, Banks said, he had been a modest donor to the Conservative Party, giving about two hundred thousand pounds.\n\nIn “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that Farage phoned him after an introductory lunch, asking him if he would contribute a hundred thousand pounds to *ukip*{: .small}. Farage planned to make news by announcing that a Conservative donor had defected to *ukip*{: .small}. Banks said yes. “My businesses in this country and overseas, where I own a number of diamond mines, were doing very well,” he writes. “I wanted to give something back, and help the fight to get Britain out of the E.U.”\n\nOn the morning that the donation was made, the former Conservative leader William Hague told reporters that he’d never heard of Arron Banks. The snub riled Banks so much that he decided to increase his donation to a million pounds.\n\n“Hague called me a nobody,” Banks said. “Now he knows who I am.”\n\nThe details of Banks’s life before he gate-crashed British politics are difficult to piece together, in part because he has told conflicting versions of his life story. When questioned by a parliamentary committee in June, Banks admitted to frequently telling lies, noting, “We certainly weren’t above leading journalists up the country path, making fun of them—same with politicians.”\n\nIn his book, Banks writes that he “grew up in Durban,” in South Africa. “[All Out War,](https://www.amazon.com/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)” a definitive account of the E.U. referendum by the British journalist Tim Shipman, similarly asserts that Banks spent his “early life” in South Africa. But Banks told me that although his father worked in the sugar trade abroad, mostly in southern and eastern Africa, he had remained behind in England, where his mother lived, and that until the age of eleven or twelve he had attended a “local school.”\n\nWhat is beyond doubt is that, at around the age of twelve, Banks was sent to a tumbledown boarding school in Berkshire, England, called Crookham Court. At the end of each term, he told me, he was flown to wherever his father was then working—South Africa, Swaziland, Somalia—as if he were an “Army brat.” This peripatetic childhood seems to have informed his later politics. Banks shares with some other Brexiteers an imperial nostalgia. He has spoken publicly about his love of the Commonwealth—the group of nations that are mostly former colonies of the British Empire—and of feeling more at home with Anglo-Saxon “kith and kin,” such as white Australians and South Africans, than with other kinds of foreigners. During our interview, I noticed that Banks pronounces “Kenya” with a long “e”—a pronunciation, still used by some white Kenyans, that was customary before Kenya gained its independence, in 1963. Banks denies being racist but admits to being “tribal.”\n\nIn 1989, some years after Banks left Crookham Court, a BBC documentary exposed the owner of the school, Philip Cadman, as a pedophile, and the school shut down. Several other former teachers have since been imprisoned for abusing boys. But Banks told me that he had “no issues” at the school and had a “lovely time.” In 2013, he posted angry messages on a Facebook page for former pupils, decrying the “victim culture” of the people sharing their stories, and accusing one student of “crying over spilt milk.” In the same exchange, he said, “I abhor homosexuality and abuse of any kind,” before clarifying his position: “Re homosexuality—I’m just old fashioned and don’t like it sorry.” Banks says that he acted as a character witness for Cadman at Cadman’s trial, in 1990. When I suggested that this was an odd thing for him to do, Banks said, “It shows my independent streak. He was a decorated war hero. I was asked to say what did I think. I can only say what I thought, which was: I saw nothing.” Cadman was found guilty, and spent several years in prison.\n\nIan Mucklejohn, who taught Banks English at Crookham Court, and has since written a book, “[Had](https://www.amazon.com/Had-Tragedy-Crookham-School-Fiction/dp/1782204008),” about the abuse scandal, told me that it was obvious from Banks’s school essays that his political outlook was “really quite reactionary—very fixed, and firm.” Mucklejohn suggested that Banks’s lack of sympathy toward victims was a sign of emotional damage. Even students who hadn’t been molested, Mucklejohn writes in his book, had been “brutalised by a regime in which physical abuse and absence of human feeling became the norm.”\n\nBanks, who told me that he was expelled from both Crookham Court and a subsequent school for a “variety of offenses,” did not go to college. Instead, he worked as a door-to-door salesman near his mother’s house, in Basingstoke, southwest of London; after a while, he became a real-estate agent. He has [told](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/10/arron-banks-man-who-bought-brexit) the *New Statesman* that he became “quite good at persuading people to buy things they didn’t want to buy.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8c1973a9c5cd2cbc9a0654]\n\n+++\n\nIn 1987, at the age of twenty-one, Banks unsuccessfully campaigned to become a Conservative member of a local council in Basingstoke. The next year, he tried and failed again. Even then, Banks used unusual tactics to woo voters. In his first election, he bought himself a golden Labrador, and took the dog with him, door to door. “My strategy was to basically chat up all the housewives,” he told me.\n\nBanks campaigned as a law-and-order candidate, at a time when there were pronounced nationwide tensions between the black community and the police force, which was predominantly white. In 1985, a white policeman had been killed during a race riot in the Tottenham area of London. Banks printed inflammatory flyers reminding voters that the Labour M.P. for Tottenham, Bernie Grant, had allegedly said that the police had received “a good hiding” in the riots. (Grant, who is of Guyanese origin, claimed to have been misquoted.) Banks distributed the leaflets in Basingstoke neighborhoods where many police officers lived. The Labour Party was incensed that a young Conservative was dredging up such a divisive, contested, and non-local issue.\n\nBanks recalled, with a chuckle, “We got in big trouble over those leaflets.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nAt the Mayfair club, the conversation approached its third hour, and noisy patrons crowded nearby tables. Wigmore offered Banks a cigarette, which seemed to loosen him up: the smoke, like his answers, poured from the side of his mouth. After the Basingstoke campaigns, Banks told me, he occasionally considered taking a more active role in British politics. In the late two-thousands, he nearly put himself forward as a potential parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party. But his political activism took a radical turn after he met Farage and made his first donation to *ukip*{: .small}. In his view, the E.U. was unjust: he told me that Britain had been “held prisoner” by Brussels.\n\nAfter the general election of 2015, when David Cameron promised an E.U. referendum, Banks and Farage believed that the mainstream anti-E.U. politicians, most of whom came from the ruling Conservative Party, were timid and slow to mobilize. These “Euroskeptic” Conservatives, they felt, wanted to freeze Farage out of the discussion, convinced that his rhetoric would antagonize swing voters. According to Shipman’s “All Out War,” in the summer of 2015 Banks gave Farage “a voice” by funding an alternative Leave movement, which became known as Leave.EU. Among other things, Banks and Farage hoped to pressure the establishment campaign for Leave into intensifying its rhetoric.\n\nBritain is now so polarized by Brexit that it’s hard to credit that there were once good-faith arguments on both sides of the debate. Remain proponents are caricatured as cosmopolitan élites who are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary voters. The Leave side is often portrayed as a quasi-racist movement whose sole aim is to foment hostility toward foreigners. But even if, as many experts suspect, implementing Brexit proves harmful, many proponents of Leave had legitimate complaints about the E.U., which they believed to be a sclerotic and overweening supranational body.\n\nHowever, even when there was an intellectual argument for Leave, there was sometimes an ugly subtext. I spent the evening of the referendum vote reporting from a pub in a poor post-industrial town in Yorkshire, in the North of England. White Leave-voting patrons complained to me that Muslims had changed their community, and that they wanted to “get my country back.” They understood that leaving the E.U. would not solve the perceived problem—the Pakistanis and Indians in their town were second- or third-generation immigrants—but they saw the referendum vote as a way to register a festering grievance.\n\nSubsequent research has reinforced this kind of anecdotal evidence. In 2016, social psychologists from Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted a study of referendum voters, and found that support for Brexit correlated with “collective narcissism”—a belief in the unparalleled greatness of one’s country—and with a heightened fear of immigrants. One of the researchers, Agnieszka Golec de Zavala, [told](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/brexit-prejudice-scientists-link-foreigners-immigrants-racism-xenophobia-leave-eu-a8078586.html) the *Independent*, “The Leave campaign gave a new, acceptable way to express xenophobia.”\n\nIn September, 2015, Banks hired the American pollster Gerry Gunster as a consultant. Banks has frequently cited some advice that Gunster gave him: referendums are won on emotion, not on facts. (Gunster told me that this was a mischaracterization: he counselled Banks that “emotional appeal *must accompany* facts.”) Accordingly, Leave.EU played heavily on the British people’s concerns about immigration in a way that Vote Leave was loath to do, at least until the end of the campaign, for fear of discouraging moderate voters.\n\nIn some ways, the campaign that Banks led was an insurgent protest movement against the smug globalism of the ruling class—against the “big politics” that Farage decried in his victory speech. But it was also a campaign that blew dog whistles. Within two days of the mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida, Leave.EU had tweeted a photograph of *isis*{: .small} fighters alongside this message: “The free movement of Kalashnikovs in Europe helps terrorists. Vote for greater security on June 23. Vote \\#Leave.” Accompanying text—“Act now before we see an Orlando-style atrocity here before too long”—made the exploitation of the Florida tragedy explicit.\n\nFarage told me recently that Leave.EU, as a nonofficial platform, had some strategic advantages over the mainstream Leave campaign. “Banks created content that was very different in nature to what the establishment Conservative politicians were doing,” he said. “It had more humor. It had more edge. Not everything they did was everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, that’s life. It was a much more populist campaign.” In March, 2016, Leave.EU launched a “Back Off, Barack\\!” petition, asking President Obama to “butt out” of the Brexit debate. The following month, a Facebook post featured a thuggish group portrait of E.U. supporters, such as Angela Merkel and Tony Blair, calling them “The Hateful Eight.”\n\nBanks, through his insurance businesses, had call centers at his disposal, and in “The Bad Boys of Brexit” he wrote that he planned to deploy these resources on behalf of Leave.EU. Something close to that appears to have happened. In February, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, which is owned by Banks, were collectively fined a hundred and twenty thousand pounds by the U.K. Information Commissioner, a regulator who monitors breaches of data privacy, because Leave.EU had sent hundreds of thousands of political advertisements to Eldon customers. Banks had appeared before Parliament and denied that Eldon employees had worked simultaneously on the political campaign—but, months later, he was countered by whistle-blowers. One former employee told the *Observer*, “I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t want to work on the political stuff. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I didn’t want to be complicit in it.” Another said, “Some of these images were really horrible. The immigrants and refugee stuff. But there were always these urgent requests coming in. You were told to stop what you were doing and do something for Leave.EU.”\n\nBanks disdains what he calls “professional politicians,” and in the months before the referendum he offended many of them, including some who were nominally on his side. He described Douglas Carswell, a Euroskeptic M.P. and a key figure within Vote Leave, as “borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in.” Leaders of Vote Leave, in turn, described Banks as “impossible.” Attempts to bring the two anti-E.U. groups together failed. Banks often publicly referred to Matthew Elliot, the chairman of Vote Leave, as Lord Elliot of Loserville. In February, 2016, after the London *Times* quoted unnamed Vote Leave sources accusing Leave.EU of being racist and homophobic, Banks threatened to sue Elliot.\n\nBanks makes enemies easily. When his appearance before the parliamentary committee in June ran long, he refused to take any more questions, citing “a lunch appointment.” When the committee chair, Damian Collins, asked him to stay for five more minutes, Banks scolded Collins as if he were a child—“The word is ‘no’&nbsp;”—then walked out.\n\nBanks, by his own admission, often irritated even his closest allies. He recalls that, after his insulting remarks about Carswell were published, Farage bellowed at him, “What the fuck have you done?”\n\nFarage told me that Banks is “very pugnacious,” adding, “I’ve had plenty of screaming matches with him.” Banks and Wigmore, he said, “wouldn’t even answer the phone to me some days, I was so annoyed with them\\!”\n\nBanks’s bulldozing style reflected his personality, but it was also a strategy. He told me, “We played the media like a Stradivarius,” noting that “if we spent eight million in the referendum, we got thirty-five, forty million in free publicity” by outraging liberal commentators. This tactic had an obvious model across the Atlantic. “We are going to be blunt, edgy, and controversial, Donald Trump-style,” Banks wrote in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” adding, “If BBC Producers aren’t spluttering organic muesli over their breakfast tables every morning, we won’t be doing our job.”\n\nWith days to go before the referendum, Farage unveiled a new *ukip*{: .small} poster. The words “*breaking point*{: .small},” in giant red letters, were superimposed on a photograph of a snaking line of dark-skinned immigrants waiting to enter the E.U. Many observers denounced the poster as racist. A few hours after the launch, the Labour M.P. Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right nationalist, Thomas Mair, who shouted “Britain First” as he shot and stabbed her. Farage was pilloried.\n\nBanks told me that Farage wanted to shelve the new campaign, but that he and Wigmore urged him to “hold his nerve.” Even after Cox’s death, he said, polls indicated that immigration remained “the No. 1 issue, by a runaway margin.” Banks told me that there was nothing wrong with the image or with its message. “It was a war,” he said. “Anything goes.”\n\nWhen Cox was killed, both sides in the referendum battle agreed to a two-day pause in campaigning. But Channel 4 News recently unearthed e-mails from the day after the murder in which Banks instructed Leave.EU’s team to “keep pumping” and to “up the Spend” on a pro-Brexit Facebook video. Liz Bilney, Leave.EU’s C.E.O., agreed, noting that, with active campaigning halted, the video “could get a lot of take up.” Banks replied, “Exactly—press it harder.”\n\nAfter the referendum, Leave’s competing factions scrambled to claim credit for the victory. Dominic Cummings, the key strategist in Vote Leave, believed that Farage and Leave.EU had been a “net drag” on the campaign. Banks told me that the social-media postings of Leave.EU reached working-class voters, particularly in the North of England, who would not otherwise have voted. Iain Dale, a broadcaster and a prominent Brexiteer, who published “Bad Boys,” told me that, if Leave.EU had been the official campaign, Leave would certainly have lost, but that “without a doubt” the two campaigns had dovetailed.\n\nBen Page, who runs the polling company Ipsos Mori, told me, “One can’t prove that the Banks money made the difference on its own. The key point is that when something is very close, as this was, anything can make a difference. Targeted Facebook advertising, the extra publicity, Farage, and the migrant poster—any or all of that could have swung it over the line. By having an official and unofficial Leave campaign, there was the ability to offer a respectable (sovereignty) and less respectable (migrant scum) argument simultaneously.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a]\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\nIt may be many months before the National Crime Agency concludes its investigation into the source of Banks’s donations to Leave-aligned groups. Given that Banks’s business life has been picaresque, and his financial history opaque, many questions may never be fully answered. For Remain-supporting Britons, the feeling of suspense is similar to that of Americans who yearn for the Mueller inquiry to reach its end, even though it may not offer the definitive evidence they crave.\n\nBanks told me that in 1987, shortly after his first foray into local politics, he was given a junior position at Lloyd’s of London, the cornerstone of the British insurance industry; over a game of croquet, he’d impressed an acquaintance who worked there. Banks told me that he had recently become engaged to his first wife, Caroline, and needed a “proper job.” At Lloyd’s, he worked his way up in a car-insurance division by taking positions in unglamorous locations around England.\n\nBy the end of the nineties, he had started working for a small insurance firm, MotorCycle Direct, which had one office above a bakery in Thornbury, a town in western England. He was given a twenty-per-cent stake in the company, and in November, 2000, when he resigned and sold his shares, he had a quarter of a million pounds at his disposal.\n\nDuring the next decade and a half, Banks became an entrepreneur, building a network of businesses, largely in insurance. His main office is in Bristol, and his best-known brand is GoSkippy, a company that promotes itself as offering “first-class insurance at the most competitive prices.” In 2017, the *Sunday Times* Rich List estimated Banks’s fortune to be about two hundred and fifty million pounds; Banks told me that he “broadly agrees” with this figure.\n\nThe *Financial Times* and others have suggested that this assessment is too high, but it’s hard to get a clear picture of Banks’s business dealings, because many of his firms are based in such “secrecy jurisdictions” as Gibraltar, the Isle of Man, and Bermuda. (Insurance companies are often based in offshore locations.) In the early part of this decade, Banks began branching out into other business sectors. In addition to the African diamond mines, he has invested in an iodine factory, a political consultancy, a wealth-management firm, an investigations-and-security firm, and a country-house resort, in the west of England, that is managed by his father.\n\nBanks’s biggest windfall appears to have come in 2014, when he sold an insurance company called Brightside, receiving about twenty-two million pounds for his shares. Other Banks businesses have run into trouble. In 2013, Southern Rock, an insurance underwriter based in Gibraltar, was found by the local regulator to be operating with insufficient capital reserves. Since then, Banks and other shareholders have been compelled to refinance Southern Rock with many tens of millions of pounds. Banks has said that he has put more than forty million pounds into Southern Rock. The company addressed the shortfall, in part, by selling assets it owned to other firms in the Banks group—a strategy that has aroused suspicions among financial journalists, because such transactions are sometimes used as a screen for money laundering.\n\nBanks told me, “The only thing that happened at Southern Rock was that we sold an asset for which we received cash in return.” He added, “The idea that there is any kind of magic going on is absurd.”\n\nRecently, I spoke to Tom Keatinge, a former banker at J.&nbsp;P. Morgan who now works as a money-laundering expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank. Keatinge told me that, even when looking only at publicly available information about Banks’s businesses, “red flags do pop out all over the place.” The arrangement to refinance Southern Rock forms part of a pattern of investments and bailouts that seems to make little financial sense. “There appears, from an outside perspective, to be an attempt, at several points, to conjure value from thin air,” he said.\n\nA 2017 [report](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/how-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit/) by Open Democracy estimated that Banks’s empire had sustained enough losses that his gross earnings since 2001 were only about twenty-two million pounds. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at twenty-five million. As Open Democracy saw it, Banks had spent about “half his lifetime earnings” on political donations—“an amazingly generous amount.” The implication is that some of the money Banks invested in Brexit came from foreign, illegitimate sources.\n\n“I’m an entrepreneur,” Banks told me. “With all due respect to journalists or anybody else, how the hell do they know what investments I’ve got? You know, I might be a good stock-market investor. I might own bonds.”\n\nI asked him if he’d made significant profits through stocks or bonds. After a pause, he said, “Well, I’m pretty good. I’m not too shabby—put it that way.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn 1998, Banks divorced Caroline, and three years later he married Ekaterina (Katya) Paderina, who grew up in Yekaterinburg, east of the Ural Mountains. In interviews, Banks has recalled meeting Paderina in 2000, at a Britney Spears concert. The marriage was also Katya Banks’s second. In 1998, when she was twenty-five, she married a retired merchant seaman, Eric Butler. Recently, I visited Butler at his apartment in Portsmouth, a port city in southern England, and the site of a British Navy base. (According to a [BBC investigation](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46460194), an offshore company linked to Banks, Ural Properties, owns an apartment close to the naval base; Banks denies having any connection to Ural.) Now seventy-five, Butler speaks with a stutter, which was caused by a stroke, but he easily recalled dates, times, and events.\n\nHe told me that, in the summer of 1998, he met Paderina on Portsmouth’s waterfront, where she was sunbathing topless. He was fifty-four and divorced. When he asked her what she did before coming to Portsmouth, she said that she’d been living in Dubai, but had been “treated as a common prostitute” and deported. Official records in the Emirates confirm that she was deported. (Paderina, through Wigmore, declined to speak to *The New Yorker.* Banks would not comment on his wife’s activities in Dubai.)\n\nButler and Paderina began a relationship. Butler wasn’t wealthy, he says, but he owned a “nice house,” and he promised to help Paderina pay for college. When she suggested that they get married, he asked if she was looking for love or for a passport. “Love,” she said.\n\nThey were married within a few months. Butler recalls that, shortly after the ceremony, Paderina said, “&nbsp;‘I do not love you. I am not married to you in Russia. And, if you ever disobey me, you will feel the full force of my father’s connections.’&nbsp;” (She does not remember saying this.)\n\nWhen Paderina’s parents flew in from Yekaterinburg for a visit, her father, Evgeny, told Butler that he worked in the “government property business.” According to Butler, he also boasted “about his connections with the Russian Mafia.” Paderina’s mother, Olga, worked at a language school, and her expertise seems to have benefitted Katya, who speaks six languages.\n\nButler said that Paderina often stayed out most of the night, without explanation. One day, he was surprised by a visit from police officers at the Special Branch, which is concerned with national security and intelligence. They questioned him about his wife’s daily activities and promised to return again. Later, Butler told me, the officers informed him that Paderina was depositing significant sums of money in private bank accounts. In 1999, he filed for divorce. Paderina attacked him with a lamp and was charged with assault. (Banks later told the *Sunday Times* that Paderina had acted in “self-defence.”)\n\nIn the time that he and Paderina were together, she became pregnant with their son, Darren, who is now eighteen, and who has been brought up by Katya and Arron Banks. Butler told me that he felt pressure from Darren not to disparage Katya, but that he also felt an imperative to tell the truth.\n\nWhile Paderina’s marriage to Butler was ending, she learned that she was in danger of being deported from the U.K. She asked the local M.P., Mike Hancock, for help. They began spending time together; Butler accused them of having an affair. (They denied it.) Hancock, who is now in his seventies, has notably pro-Russian views. Indeed, in 2010 Hancock’s colleagues in a parliamentary group on Russian affairs became so disconcerted by his “pro-Putin and pro-Medvedev” agenda that they ousted him from a leadership role. Later that year, British security officials attempted to deport his parliamentary assistant, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, a young Russian with whom he had a four-year affair, because they suspected her of being a member of the S.V.R., Russia’s foreign-intelligence service. Zatuliveter had been observed with an S.V.R. officer in London; she also had relationships with a German *nato*{: .small} official and a Dutch diplomat.\n\nZatuliveter fought to stay in Britain. A special immigration panel concluded that, “on the balance of probabilities,” she was not a Russian agent.\n\nBanks told me that insinuations that his wife, who helps to manage their family properties, had any connection with Russian espionage were preposterous. Katya, he said, was not even interested in politics. The license plate of her car—X MI5 SPY—is a knowing wink at her detractors. Banks did not comment on Katya’s relationship with Hancock, except to note that her interaction with him was routine: “She had overstayed her student visa, and so she wrote to her local M.P.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c]\n\n+++\n\nWigmore told me it was “laughable” to suggest that Paderina or her family had Mafia or intelligence connections, arguing, “They would have been either very rich or very powerful—they were neither.” At the club, he observed, “If you’re *really* a spy, you don’t put ‘X MI5 SPY’ on the back of your car.”\n\nRecently, I spoke to Boris Volodarsky, who was a former undercover operative for the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency. He is now an academic authority on Russian espionage. In his opinion, Russian intelligence services—most likely the S.V.R.—“were in this or that way involved in the life and further career development” of Paderina and Zatuliveter. He told me that their activities reminded him of “swallows”—young Soviet women who sought to influence “important and promising foreign targets.” When I noted that Zatuliveter had officially been cleared of espionage, he told me that the judgment violated “all logic and common sense.” In 2011, he said, the British were naïve about the nature and scope of Russian intelligence in the Putin era. John Sipher, who retired, in 2014, from a twenty-eight-year career in the National Clandestine Service, which included a period in Moscow, told me that he also questioned the panel’s judgment, calling it “some of the worst analysis I’ve ever seen.”\n\nBanks has publicly acknowledged that his marriage to Katya has been fraught. In 2014, they consulted divorce lawyers, and Katya now lives with her mother, Olga. I asked him what it was like being married to a Russian, given Russia’s frosty relationship with Britain. “I’m not anti-Russian,” he told me. “I’m not particularly pro-Russian. I’m agnostic.”\n\nBut his public statements on Russian foreign policy have not been agnostic. He supported Putin’s 2014 military intervention in Crimea, saying that the invaded region was “as Russian as the Isle of Wight is British.” Leave.EU has also posted notably pro-Russian social-media content; it once hailed Putin for “wiping out *isis*{: .small} in Syria.” I asked Banks how he had felt when U.K. officials accused G.R.U. officers of poisoning Sergei Skripal, the Russian-British double agent, last year in Salisbury. He said, “My only reaction to the Skripal thing was that, having been involved in politics and seen the dirty tricks that go on, I’m naturally distrustful of *anything* I read in the media. Because there’s the usual agendas sitting behind that.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that, at a *ukip*{: .small} conference in September, 2015, he and Wigmore met a “shady character called Oleg,” who was introduced to them as “the First Secretary” at the Russian Embassy—“in other words, the KGB’s man in London.” “Oleg” is Alexander Udod, an S.V.R. officer who was ejected from Britain after the Skripal poisoning. Volodarksy, the former G.R.U. officer, suggested to me that Udod was also the S.V.R. agent who had met with Ekaterina Zatuliveter in London. (In Zatuliveter’s immigration hearing, she referred to the agent by one initial: “U.”)\n\nBanks writes in his book that Udod invited him and Wigmore to lunch with the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, on November 6, 2015. They readily accepted. “You get invited by the Ambassador, of course you go\\!” Banks told me. “Maybe it was a mistake.”\n\n“They weren’t perceived as bad back then,” Wigmore added. At the time, he said, British politicians were “actively trying to get people to invest in Russia.”\n\nWigmore later texted me to say that “The Bad Boys of Brexit” contained an error: he, not Udod, had suggested the embassy lunch. Another member of Banks’s circle, however, told me that the meeting was indeed arranged by Udod.\n\nIn any case, the embassy meeting was a riotous success. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks writes that he “hit it off from the word go” with the Russian delegation. Scheduled to last an hour, the meeting became a six-hour “boozy lunch,” and ended with Ambassador Yakovenko offering vodka from a bottle that had supposedly been made for Stalin.\n\nNo other meetings with Russian diplomats or businessmen are described in “The Bad Boys of Brexit.” For more than a year, the public had the impression that this single lunch engagement was Banks’s only meeting with Ambassador Yakovenko. This wasn’t true. Banks told me that during the “boozy lunch” he mentioned owning diamond interests in southern Africa. Ambassador Yakovenko invited Banks to another meeting, later that November, at which a Russian businessman named Siman Povarenkin offered Banks a chance to invest in the consolidation of six gold mines in Russia—a multibillion-dollar deal. After that meeting, Banks wrote an e-mail to Povarenkin in which he said, “I am very bullish on gold so keen to have a look.” Banks relayed Povarenkin’s pitch to several associates, including Jim Mellon, the Leave.EU “ambassador.”\n\nBanks told me that, after consulting with several experts, including an investment banker named Nick van den Brul, he turned down Povarenkin’s proposal. But, according to a recent report by Channel 4, Banks had been enthusiastic about the gold deal. At his behest, a detailed pitch document was written, in which Banks and his partners expressed interest in overseeing the project. A subsequent e-mail from one of the partners suggested that Banks and his investors travel to Moscow to meet bankers from Sberbank—a lender with close ties to the Kremlin—to discuss “financial muscle.”\n\nFour months before the referendum, van den Brul discussed with Banks the idea of investing in Alrosa, a diamond producer controlled by the Russian state, which was in the process of being partially privatized. In an e-mail, van den Brul said that doing so could “open up some opportunities.” Banks didn’t take up this offer, either. (A fund associated with Mellon did invest, but a representative said the fund’s specific investments were made without his knowledge.)\n\nTwo months before the referendum, a third opportunity to work with Russians was presented to Banks: a gold-mining project in Guinea, in West Africa, owned by Ilya Karas, a London-based Russian businessman with a Belizean passport. Karas had overseen an unsuccessful oil-infrastructure project in Russia, and he’d owned a bank in Djibouti.\n\nWigmore recently told me that Banks and Karas never met, saying, “When we checked it out, we decided not to proceed further.” Karas, however, told me that he met Banks in May, 2016, in Bristol. In the end, he said, Banks decided not to invest in the Guinean project.\n\n“The whole point is that as a businessman you entertain and look at everything,” Banks told me. “You shouldn’t be judged on what you *don’t* do.” This is reasonable enough. Yet it is curious that at least three opportunities with Russians were dangled in front of him in the months before the referendum. The Labour M.P. Ben Bradshaw asked Parliament “why the Kremlin would offer Mr. Banks sweetheart deals.”\n\nBanks told me that ambassadors often help arrange business deals between their home and host countries. Wigmore has said that, while serving as a trade envoy for Belize, he took part in many similar business discussions, and not just with Russians. But Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a career C.I.A. officer and a Russia expert who is now at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told me that Ambassador Yakovenko’s involvement in such meetings with Banks was suspicious. Mowatt-Larssen discounted the idea that an ambassador in a key post like London would set up business deals without the Kremlin’s awareness. He said that Russian ambassadors do exactly what “Putin or his closest advisers have asked them to do,” adding, “They are not foreign-ministry representatives as much as they are Putin’s representatives.”\n\nBanks has said that he has never sought out investment in Russia, and that it is “absolute garbage” to suggest that he has taken money from Russians, or that Russian money had been funnelled into Brexit, or that he’d been influenced by Russian officials. If his encounters with Russians in 2015 and 2016 were actually part of an attempted influence campaign, he was at a loss to explain Putin’s motives. “I wonder what the Russians wanted from me?” he [asked](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/world/europe/russia-britain-brexit-arron-banks.html) a reporter from the New York *Times*.\n\nGiven that Banks had become an ardent Brexit supporter by 2014, it seems unfair to suggest that Russian activities in 2015 and 2016 reframed his views. Yet Banks may not have given a full accounting of his interactions with Russians.\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn 2013 and 2014, Banks bought major stakes in four diamond mines in South Africa and a license for exploration in Lesotho. The South African mines were small and largely exhausted. Two of the mines required millions of dollars of investment simply to resume operations. One is still dormant.\n\nBanks told me that the mines had been bought cheaply. I asked several industry experts about Banks’s claim, in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” that the mines were so profitable that they helped prompt his sizable donation to *ukip*{: .small} in 2014. The experts told me that there’s scant chance of his having accrued any legitimate profits from the mines by the time he made his million-pound pledge.\n\nSo far, the most notable thing that the mines have produced is a vicious commercial dispute between Banks and his former partner in the mines, Chris Kimber. They have been making claims and counterclaims in a South African court. In a sworn statement, Kimber has claimed that Banks attempted to raise money from Russians, and that Banks put “enormous pressure” on him to obtain diamonds that would impress potential investors, even before the mines were fully operational. Kimber claims that Banks and his partners asked him to “find diamonds from third parties.” Banks denies all this, and alleges that Kimber defrauded him of his fair share of the diamonds produced by the mine.\n\nNo proof has emerged that Banks committed crimes in South Africa. But Brad Brooks-Rubin, a former State Department official who helps run the Sentry, a nonprofit group that monitors corruption in conflict zones, said that the diamond-mining industry “is almost *designed* to allow laundering.” Oversight was minimal, and mines were often sold through a “sight” system, without a proper audit of what each mine produced.\n\nRecently, I spoke to someone with intimate knowledge of the business relationship between Banks and Kimber, who told me that, well before Banks met Ambassador Yakovenko, Banks sought Russian investment in his South African mines. (Wigmore says that Banks approached potential investors from various nations.) Banks, the source said, also attempted to invest in gold mines in Russia, and had travelled to Moscow to discuss potential deals.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c19]\n\n+++\n\nAccording to the source, Banks had also attempted to hire Bourevestnik, a diamond-screening company that is a subsidiary of Alrosa, the Russian firm. Banks told me, categorically, that this wasn’t true, but a former colleague of his said that he had seen Bourevestnik machines being used at Banks’s mines.\n\n“There was no Alrosa\\!” Banks told me.\n\nKimber, in his sworn statement, writes that, in 2015, “Banks was in discussions with Alrosa and had made certain promises to them.” (Alrosa denies this.) Earlier this year, Banks’s fixer in South Africa, James Pryor, told a BBC reporter that Banks had sought Russian investment. Later, Pryor denied having said this, even though the interview was recorded.\n\nDuring this period, Banks cultivated influential politicians in Lesotho, including the Prime Minister, Tom Thabane. Reporting by Channel 4 suggests that they helped Banks acquire mining licenses there. Banks has admitted to the BBC that he placed money in the private account of one of the politicians, but he denies that it was a bribe; he was merely making a political donation.\n\nThabane recently told the BBC that in August, 2014, when unrest forced him and another politician into exile in South Africa, Banks paid for their food and their lodgings. The Kimber affidavit also suggests that Banks was prepared to arrange “mercenary support” for allies in Lesotho, and had even collected guns for this purpose. The former colleague dismissed this as “bonfire talk,” and Banks strongly denied Kimber’s allegations. He told me that if any associates of his had collected weapons it was simply to protect his mining properties. “If you own a diamond mine, guess what?” he said. “People are going to raid it.”\n\nBanks told me that Kimber was not to be trusted, because he was his opponent in a legal “scrap.” He also claimed that Kimber was himself under investigation in South Africa. A recent Channel 4 report maintains that, in 2017, an associate of Banks’s offered inducements to a Hawks officer in return for his opening an investigation into Kimber. (Wigmore acknowledged that Banks had asked the Hawks to investigate Kimber, but denied any impropriety.) The Hawks recently told me that they are not currently investigating either Kimber or Banks, having decided that, at least for now, the dispute between the men is a “civil matter.”\n\n“It’s not that I don’t understand why journalists love this shit,” Banks said of his mines, batting away further questions. “Gold, diamonds, Trump, Russia—I mean, what’s *not* to like?”\n\n-=-=-=-\nAfter Banks ordered another glass of white wine at the Mayfair club, he told me that he was fascinated by journalists. As a tribe, he said, they were often “so clever that they’re stupid”: reporters became so obsessed with fleshing out narratives aligned with their political sensibility that they couldn’t see an uncomplicated truth in front of their nose. Banks told me a story about visiting Mississippi, in August, 2016, with Farage, who spoke at one of Trump’s campaign rallies. Trump introduced him as “the man behind Brexit.”\n\n“You could palpably feel the atmosphere,” Banks recalled. Despite polls to the contrary, he felt certain that Trump was going to win. It had been the same with Brexit, Banks said: “The journalists were, like, ‘This isn’t happening—we don’t want it to happen, therefore it *won’t* happen.’&nbsp;”\n\nBanks suggested that the media’s inquiries into the source of his Leave donations, and into his connections with Russia, were desperate attempts to prove that the two great populist votes of 2016 had been illegitimate. Remainer journalists saw conspiracies where there were none.\n\nThis was its own conspiracy theory, of course. The truth is likely to be more complicated. Banks may not be a Russian asset, but the Russians have clearly courted him for years. Banks, meanwhile, has insistently misled British reporters and investigators about the nature of his relationship with the Russians, to the point that it seems fair to wonder if yet more connections will emerge. And one thing is clear: although Russia does not seem to have achieved anything like the success it did by stealing Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, it certainly attempted to interfere in British affairs.\n\nIn the view of some seasoned observers of Putin’s disinformation campaigns, the Russians may be pleased to have had their discussions with Banks exposed: the revelations have compromised him in the eyes of many Britons, sowing greater division in the U.K. Peter Pomerantsev, the author of “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,” a book about Russian propaganda, has no specific knowledge about the Banks case, but he told me that such techniques have been used since Soviet times. “There is a great word to describe it, *zapachkat*—it means to ‘besmirch,’ or ‘make someone dirty,’&nbsp;” Pomerantsev said. “Getting caught seems like half the trick.”\n\nOne journalist who brought Banks’s meetings with Russians to light is Carole Cadwalladr, of the *Observer*, whose reporting has led to numerous Brexit-related scoops. Banks spoke briefly, and snidely, to me about her work; without citing examples, he said that it was riddled with errors, in part because she saw deep ties where there were only glancing connections. He depicted Cadwalladr as a lonely woman staring at a corkboard on which pinned names were connected with string in a complicated pattern of zigzags, as in a detective show.\n\nBanks then talked about his relationship with Steve Bannon. According to some reports, they are co-conspirators: right-wing vandals who have caused mayhem in Britain and America on behalf of shadowy paymasters, and who are themselves connected, through Cambridge Analytica. In a leaked 2015 e-mail between Bannon and Banks, the two discussed whether it might be possible to raise funds for the Brexit project in the U.S. before the official Brexit campaign began. (If foreign funds had been raised *during* the campaign, this would have been illegal.) Banks, however, insisted that his discussions with Bannon were insignificant, and that they hardly meant that he and Bannon were friends.\n\n“We *dislike* him\\!” Wigmore added.\n\nWhen Banks, Wigmore, Farage, and others from the Brexit campaign made their November, 2016, visit to Trump Tower, Bannon was present. Banks told me that, before his party went up to see Trump, Bannon attempted to extract from him a forty-thousand-pound payment. Ostensibly, this request was related to work done by Cambridge Analytica for Leave.EU, but, given the context, it seems almost as if Bannon were charging an admission fee to see the President-elect. (A source close to Bannon called this idea “preposterous.”) Banks told me that he refused, saying that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t performed any services for Leave.EU. This riled Bannon, but Farage placated him, and the Brexit entourage met with Trump, in his apartment, without money changing hands. Trump, Banks told me, was “thoughtful, pleasant, almost polite, and funny.”\n\nI asked Banks what kind of Cambridge Analytica services Bannon had offered in 2015. At the time, the company was touting itself as an expert in microtargeting voters, with access to millions of people’s “psychographic” information. This cache of data was later found to have been improperly culled from Facebook.\n\n“They put an offer to me that was sort of contemptible,” Banks said. He was asked to give “a million, up front,” for voter-targeting suggestions, which would be based on an algorithm derived from the Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica promised that the results would help Leave.EU “raise six or seven million pounds for the campaign.” Banks looked at me and said, “We turned it down.”\n\nWhy? Banks laughed, and the half smile broke into a full one. “Because it was illegal,” he said.&nbsp;♦\n\n","articleSection":"letter from london","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ed Caesar","sameAs":"https://the-new-yorker.com/contributor/ed-caesar/"}],"dateModified":"2019-06-25T16:32:21.061","datePublished":"2019-03-18T05:00:00.000","headline":"The Chaotic Triumph of Arron Banks, the “Bad Boy of Brexit”","image":["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/2:1/w_1843,h_921,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/2:2/w_445,h_445,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/16:9/w_1839,h_1034,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/4:3/w_1844,h_1383,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/1:1/w_1843,h_1843,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg"],"keywords":["letter from london","apple news opt in","apple news paid","apple news preview"],"thumbnailUrl":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58/1:1/w_1843,h_1843,c_limit/190325_r33938.jpg","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/25/the-chaotic-triumph-of-arron-banks-the-bad-boy-of-brexit","isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"The New Yorker"},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"hasPart":[{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":"False","cssSelector":".paywall"}],"alternativeHeadline":"The U.K. is in a panic over voters’ decision to withdraw from the E.U.

has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">As the sun came up in London on June 24, 2016, Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore were walking through Westminster, the political district of London, smoking cigarettes and drinking champagne from the bottle. The shocking result of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union had just been announced: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit">Leave had won</a>.</p><p>Banks, an entrepreneur whose fortune comes primarily from owning insurance companies, had financed and directed the most aggressive wing of the Leave campaign, Leave.EU, and he had given or loaned a total of thirteen million dollars to various anti-E.U. causes. In Britain, where campaign-spending laws have historically been stringent, and donations modest by American standards, Banks’s contributions are thought to constitute the largest sum ever donated by an individual to a political campaign. Banks, who is fifty-two, is short and moonfaced, and often talks with a mischievous half smile; Wigmore, a former Conservative Party operative who serves as Banks’s communications chief, also fifty-two, has floppy black hair and a chaotic manner. Virtually inseparable, and prone to boyish humor, they refer to each other as Banksy and Wiggy.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>Although the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave’s victory was in many ways <em>his</em> victory. He had given considerable financial support to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nigel-farage">Nigel Farage</a>, the sharp-tongued Euroskeptic, which had allowed Farage to remain at the center of the Brexit debate. Many experts also believed that the rambunctious Leave.EU campaign—which stoked fears of uncontrolled immigration—had roused voters who had been unmoved by the more technocratic messages of Vote Leave. A typical Leave.EU post on Facebook warned voters that “<em class="small">immigration without assimilation equals invasion.</em>” A post about the dangers of “free movement” within the E.U. was accompanied by a photograph of ticking explosives.</p><p>That night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage’s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames. Farage called the referendum “a victory for ordinary people,” adding, “We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption, and deceit.” He concluded, “Let June the twenty-third go down in our history as our Independence Day!”</p><p>Shortly after 5 <em class="small">a.m</em>., Banks and Wigmore took the champagne and headed for a friend’s apartment, to shower and change before making media appearances. On the way, they spotted an old man, in a tattered Barbour jacket, attempting to withdraw large sums of money from an A.T.M. The old man recognized them. He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Banks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such “lies.” A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity. Laughing, they assured the man that nothing of the sort would happen. Banks handed him the bottle of champagne, and urged him to celebrate. As Banks recalled it, “He genuinely thought the world was going to come to an end!”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Banks told me this story, alongside Wigmore, on a rainy November afternoon two and a half years later, at 5 Hertford Street—a private member’s club, in Mayfair, where male guests are required to wear a formal jacket. The Brexit project that they had so ardently supported had left the U.K. in a state of panic. The government of Prime Minister <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> had almost imploded several times. The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain’s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn’t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as “no deal,” would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine.</p><p>This outcome was Banks’s preferred result. “No deal means we <em>leave</em>,” he told me at the club.</p><p>Banks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency—Britain’s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners’ money in electoral campaigns. “A number of criminal offences may have been committed,” the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks’s and Bilney’s stories had “changed over time,” and that what they told the commission was “not consistent” with company records. (Bilney says that this “evolvement of response” can be ascribed to the commission’s failure to understand “our business structures.”)</p><p>A sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency’s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote. Although President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> has claimed that Russia was ambivalent about the Brexit referendum, he recently pressed May to “fulfill the will” of the British people and rule out a second referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U.—which, polls suggest, would lead to a narrow win for Remain. Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin’s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea.</p><p>According to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a “regime-change agenda” around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin’s regime might be targeted next. “Russia felt they needed to push back hard,” Weiss told me. “They wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that’s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and—I think—their support of Brexit fits in.”</p><p>Banks’s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent “ambassador” for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a “friend and business partner,” made much of his money by investing in Russia. (A representative for Mellon denied that Mellon has had a “close business or professional relationship” with Banks.) Banks’s 2016 memoir, “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum/dp/1785901826/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum/dp/1785901826/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Bad Boys of Brexit</a>,” acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London. Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency’s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks’s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, “There are still so many questions unanswered about Banks—where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.”</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed callout--content-type--cartoon"><figure

response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats. According to various reports, in the early months of 2016, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, she refused a request by British intelligence services to investigate Banks’s conduct. Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports—including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people’s choice and must be enforced. Given the tensions surrounding the referendum, she is unlikely to invite further probes into the financial background of one of the Leave campaign’s key players. Doing so would be tantamount to using a grenade in a pub brawl.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><aside class="persistent-aside" style="position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></aside></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>In Parliament, however, both Labour and Conservative members have repeatedly questioned whether Banks’s dealings with the Russians in the lead-up to the referendum amounted to an influence campaign by a foreign power. In November, 2018, when the National Crime Agency investigation was announced, David Lammy, a Labour M.P., demanded that Britain’s departure from the E.U. be “put on hold until we know the extent of these crimes against our democracy.” Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, has called for a “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation">Mueller-style inquiry</a>” into whether the “referendum result was stolen.” The Conservative M.P. Damian Collins has demanded a broader inquiry into Russian interference in British affairs. In an interview at his office in the Houses of Parliament, he told me that he had serious concerns about the source of Banks’s funds. “The reason the questions persist is that he seems to own a number of businesses that don’t make any money,” Collins said. “There’s never really been a clear explanation from him about the funding of these campaigns.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Banks recently sent Collins’s constituents a letter calling him a “disgrace” and a “snake in the grass.” In an op-ed, Collins responded that he would not be cowed by Banks’s “bullyboy tactics.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Banks’s affairs have also fallen under scrutiny outside the U.K. Banks, Wigmore, and Farage came to public attention in the U.S. shortly after the 2016 elections, when they were photographed with President-elect <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> outside his apartment in Trump Tower. A few days later, in London, Banks and Wigmore again met with the Russian Ambassador, recounting their meeting with Trump and passing on contact details for members of Trump’s transition team. The British Web site Open Democracy has also reported that, as early as October, 2015, Banks asked <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon">Steve Bannon</a>, who later became the head of Trump’s campaign, for help in exploring possible sources of American funding for Leave.EU. (Banks says that this effort never progressed.)</p><p>Late last year, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/17/arron-banks-emails-steve-bannon-brexit-campaign-funds&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/17/arron-banks-emails-steve-bannon-brexit-campaign-funds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">e-mails leaked to the <em>Observer</em></a> revealed that Leave.EU had misrepresented to British investigators the extent of its ties to Cambridge Analytica, the now disgraced and insolvent British data firm funded by the American political donor <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mercer">Robert Mercer</a> to microtarget voters. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks flatly states that Leave.EU had “hired Cambridge Analytica.” He later insisted that his group had held only “preliminary discussions” with the firm, and never paid it anything; he repeated this claim to me. But the leaked e-mails show that discussions extended into 2016—beyond what Banks had previously admitted. Bannon is copied on some of these e-mails; in one of them, Banks writes that he “would like to get CA on the team, maybe look at the first cut of the data.” When news of the e-mails broke, Collins called them evidence of “direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump,” and redoubled his campaign to establish a broad-ranging inquiry.</p><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that there were “parallels and interconnections in abundance” between the apparent Russian efforts to influence Brexit and the well-documented, and possibly decisive, Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election. He described Putin’s ambassadors in D.C. and in London as conduits of “malign influence.” According to an American lawyer with knowledge of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Banks and Farage have become persons of interest in that inquiry. (This is “bollocks,” Wigmore said.)</p><p>In December, two South African intelligence officials confirmed to me that Banks, who owns an array of businesses in southern Africa, including several diamond mines, had been the subject of two investigations by the Hawks, South Africa’s version of the F.B.I. The first case involved looking into whether Banks used his diamond mines in South Africa to launder stones from other parts of Africa—a process known as “salting the mines.” The second explored whether Banks, or people close to him, acquired automatic weapons without a license during a period of political upheaval in Lesotho; this investigation was opened by a branch of the Hawks known as Crimes Against the State.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Considering all these investigations, Banks and Wigmore were in oddly high spirits when we met. Banks drank white wine; Wigmore, gin-and-tonic. They frequently reduced each other to gales of laughter with a joke or a reminiscence, and they found it both surreal and amusing to be figures of suspicion on three continents. A few days before the meeting, Wigmore sent me a text about the lives that he and Banks had been leading since the Brexit vote: “It’s a film a book and a thriller rolled into one lol.” He appended to the message the crying-laughing-face emoji.</p><p>Banks dismissed much of the reporting about him as overheated Remainer fantasy—the product of journalists and media proprietors who had been “driven crazy by Brexit.” This argument echoes Trump’s claim that Americans who express concerns about his campaign’s communications with Russian officials are just displacing their rage over his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Banks said that he’d given money to a campaign in an entirely legal way, and now he was being punished for having been effective. All the criminal investigations were similarly motivated by politics. One could not trust the Electoral Commission to act fairly when it referred him to the National Crime Agency, he said, because the commission was filled with Remain supporters. Brexit itself was at risk, Banks warned me, because most M.P.s were Remainers, as were many powerful people outside Parliament.</p><p>For all his bonhomie, there was a sinister aspect to Banks’s embattled outlook. Leave.EU’s social-media feed, which is overseen by Banks, often parroted the alt-right view that liberal global élites exert an outsized sway over politics and the media. Two recent posts by Leave.EU had featured images of the financier <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros">George Soros</a>, a target of anti-Semitic hatred and a focus of right-wing conspiracy theories. In one post, Soros was pictured as a puppet master controlling Tony Blair; the image echoed a Nazi propaganda poster of the nineteen-forties, in which a Jewish man controls Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin with strings.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-3 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>During our meeting, Banks spoke scathingly of the Web site Open Democracy, which has published detailed articles on Banks’s business dealings and political activities. The site is partly funded by Soros. In October, three days after a pipe bomb was discovered at Soros’s house in Connecticut, Banks tweeted, “I suppose there are good Jews and bad Jews, then George Soros.”</p><p>In our conversations, it was obvious that Banks read widely—including publications that he professes to hate, such as the liberal <em>Financial Times</em>—and that he was capable of nuanced political thought. For instance, he was able to disentangle his support of British unionism—the idea that England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should not break apart—from his opposition to the E.U., an argument that some right-wing M.P.s might have struggled with. At other times, he came across as willfully obtuse, the product of an alt-right echo chamber. He used Trumpian language about the nefarious motives of the “deep state.” In Banks’s mind, there was no doubt that important news reached the public only at times most conducive to the interests of powerful but unseen forces. At one point in our conversation, Banks suggested that behind-the-scenes figures in Britain had deliberately provoked American anxieties about the 2016 election. “Part of the whole Trump-Russia thing, and also with the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier">Steele dossier</a>, it’s absolutely the case that some of those rumors came out of the British intelligence services,” he told me. “I think there are going to be revelations along that line.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Banks first came to national attention in Britain in October, 2014, when he announced a large donation to the U.K. Independence Party, or <em class="small">ukip</em>, which was led by Nigel Farage at the time. Until then, Banks said, he had been a modest donor to the Conservative Party, giving about two hundred thousand pounds.</p><p>In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that Farage phoned him after an introductory lunch, asking him if he would contribute a hundred thousand pounds to <em class="small">ukip</em>. Farage planned to make news by announcing that a Conservative donor had defected to <em class="small">ukip</em>. Banks said yes. “My businesses in this country and overseas, where I own a number of diamond mines, were doing very well,” he writes. “I wanted to give something back, and help the fight to get Britain out of the E.U.”</p><p>On the morning that the donation was made, the former Conservative leader William Hague told reporters that he’d never heard of Arron Banks. The snub riled Banks so much that he decided to increase his donation to a million pounds.</p><p>“Hague called me a nobody,” Banks said. “Now he knows who I am.”</p><p>The details of Banks’s life before he gate-crashed British politics are difficult to piece together, in part because he has told conflicting versions of his life story. When questioned by a parliamentary committee in June, Banks admitted to frequently telling lies, noting, “We certainly weren’t above leading journalists up the country path, making fun of them—same with politicians.”</p><p>In his book, Banks writes that he “grew up in Durban,” in South Africa. “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">All Out War,</a>” a definitive account of the E.U. referendum by the British journalist Tim Shipman, similarly asserts that Banks spent his “early life” in South Africa. But Banks told me that although his father worked in the sugar trade abroad, mostly in southern and eastern Africa, he had remained behind in England, where his mother lived, and that until the age of eleven or twelve he had attended a “local school.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-4 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>What is beyond doubt is that, at around the age of twelve, Banks was sent to a tumbledown boarding school in Berkshire, England, called Crookham Court. At the end of each term, he told me, he was flown to wherever his father was then working—South Africa, Swaziland, Somalia—as if he were an “Army brat.” This peripatetic childhood seems to have informed his later politics. Banks shares with some other Brexiteers an imperial nostalgia. He has spoken publicly about his love of the Commonwealth—the group of nations that are mostly former colonies of the British Empire—and of feeling more at home with Anglo-Saxon “kith and kin,” such as white Australians and South Africans, than with other kinds of foreigners. During our interview, I noticed that Banks pronounces “Kenya” with a long “e”—a pronunciation, still used by some white Kenyans, that was customary before Kenya gained its independence, in 1963. Banks denies being racist but admits to being “tribal.”</p><p>In 1989, some years after Banks left Crookham Court, a BBC documentary exposed the owner of the school, Philip Cadman, as a pedophile, and the school shut down. Several other former teachers have since been imprisoned for abusing boys. But Banks told me that he had “no issues” at the school and had a “lovely time.” In 2013, he posted angry messages on a Facebook page for former pupils, decrying the “victim culture” of the people sharing their stories, and accusing one student of “crying over spilt milk.” In the same exchange, he said, “I abhor homosexuality and abuse of any kind,” before clarifying his position: “Re homosexuality—I’m just old fashioned and don’t like it sorry.” Banks says that he acted as a character witness for Cadman at Cadman’s trial, in 1990. When I suggested that this was an odd thing for him to do, Banks said, “It shows my independent streak. He was a decorated war hero. I was asked to say what did I think. I can only say what I thought, which was: I saw nothing.” Cadman was found guilty, and spent several years in prison.</p><p>Ian Mucklejohn, who taught Banks English at Crookham Court, and has since written a book, “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Had-Tragedy-Crookham-School-Fiction/dp/1782204008&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Had-Tragedy-Crookham-School-Fiction/dp/1782204008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Had</a>,” about the abuse scandal, told me that it was obvious from Banks’s school essays that his political outlook was “really quite reactionary—very fixed, and firm.” Mucklejohn suggested that Banks’s lack of sympathy toward victims was a sign of emotional damage. Even students who hadn’t been molested, Mucklejohn writes in his book, had been “brutalised by a regime in which physical abuse and absence of human feeling became the norm.”</p><p>Banks, who told me that he was expelled from both Crookham Court and a subsequent school for a “variety of offenses,” did not go to college. Instead, he worked as a door-to-door salesman near his mother’s house, in Basingstoke, southwest of London; after a while, he became a real-estate agent. He has <a class="external-link"

campaigned to become a Conservative member of a local council in Basingstoke. The next year, he tried and failed again. Even then, Banks used unusual tactics to woo voters. In his first election, he bought himself a golden Labrador, and took the dog with him, door to door. “My strategy was to basically chat up all the housewives,” he told me.</p><p>Banks campaigned as a law-and-order candidate, at a time when there were pronounced nationwide tensions between the black community and the police force, which was predominantly white. In 1985, a white policeman had been killed during a race riot in the Tottenham area of London. Banks printed inflammatory flyers reminding voters that the Labour M.P. for Tottenham, Bernie Grant, had allegedly said that the police had received “a good hiding” in the riots. (Grant, who is of Guyanese origin, claimed to have been misquoted.) Banks distributed the leaflets in Basingstoke neighborhoods where many police officers lived. The Labour Party was incensed that a young Conservative was dredging up such a divisive, contested, and non-local issue.</p><p>Banks recalled, with a chuckle, “We got in big trouble over those leaflets.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">At the Mayfair club, the conversation approached its third hour, and noisy patrons crowded nearby tables. Wigmore offered Banks a cigarette, which seemed to loosen him up: the smoke, like his answers, poured from the side of his mouth. After the Basingstoke campaigns, Banks told me, he occasionally considered taking a more active role in British politics. In the late two-thousands, he nearly put himself forward as a potential parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party. But his political activism took a radical turn after he met Farage and made his first donation to <em class="small">ukip</em>. In his view, the E.U. was unjust: he told me that Britain had been “held prisoner” by Brussels.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-5 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>After the general election of 2015, when David Cameron promised an E.U. referendum, Banks and Farage believed that the mainstream anti-E.U. politicians, most of whom came from the ruling Conservative Party, were timid and slow to mobilize. These “Euroskeptic” Conservatives, they felt, wanted to freeze Farage out of the discussion, convinced that his rhetoric would antagonize swing voters. According to Shipman’s “All Out War,” in the summer of 2015 Banks gave Farage “a voice” by funding an alternative Leave movement, which became known as Leave.EU. Among other things, Banks and Farage hoped to pressure the establishment campaign for Leave into intensifying its rhetoric.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Britain is now so polarized by Brexit that it’s hard to credit that there were once good-faith arguments on both sides of the debate. Remain proponents are caricatured as cosmopolitan élites who are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary voters. The Leave side is often portrayed as a quasi-racist movement whose sole aim is to foment hostility toward foreigners. But even if, as many experts suspect, implementing Brexit proves harmful, many proponents of Leave had legitimate complaints about the E.U., which they believed to be a sclerotic and overweening supranational body.</p><p>However, even when there was an intellectual argument for Leave, there was sometimes an ugly subtext. I spent the evening of the referendum vote reporting from a pub in a poor post-industrial town in Yorkshire, in the North of England. White Leave-voting patrons complained to me that Muslims had changed their community, and that they wanted to “get my country back.” They understood that leaving the E.U. would not solve the perceived problem—the Pakistanis and Indians in their town were second- or third-generation immigrants—but they saw the referendum vote as a way to register a festering grievance.</p><p>Subsequent research has reinforced this kind of anecdotal evidence. In 2016, social psychologists from Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted a study of referendum voters, and found that support for Brexit correlated with “collective narcissism”—a belief in the unparalleled greatness of one’s country—and with a heightened fear of immigrants. One of the researchers, Agnieszka Golec de Zavala, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/brexit-prejudice-scientists-link-foreigners-immigrants-racism-xenophobia-leave-eu-a8078586.html&quot;}" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/brexit-prejudice-scientists-link-foreigners-immigrants-racism-xenophobia-leave-eu-a8078586.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Independent</em>, “The Leave campaign gave a new, acceptable way to express xenophobia.”</p><p>In September, 2015, Banks hired the American pollster Gerry Gunster as a consultant. Banks has frequently cited some advice that Gunster gave him: referendums are won on emotion, not on facts. (Gunster told me that this was a mischaracterization: he counselled Banks that “emotional appeal <em>must accompany</em> facts.”) Accordingly, Leave.EU played heavily on the British people’s concerns about immigration in a way that Vote Leave was loath to do, at least until the end of the campaign, for fear of discouraging moderate voters.</p><p>In some ways, the campaign that Banks led was an insurgent protest movement against the smug globalism of the ruling class—against the “big politics” that Farage decried in his victory speech. But it was also a campaign that blew dog whistles. Within two days of the mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida, Leave.EU had tweeted a photograph of <em class="small">isis</em> fighters alongside this message: “The free movement of Kalashnikovs in Europe helps terrorists. Vote for greater security on June 23. Vote #Leave.” Accompanying text—“Act now before we see an Orlando-style atrocity here before too long”—made the exploitation of the Florida tragedy explicit.</p><p>Farage told me recently that Leave.EU, as a nonofficial platform, had some strategic advantages over the mainstream Leave campaign. “Banks created content that was very different in nature to what the establishment Conservative politicians were doing,” he said. “It had more humor. It had more edge. Not everything they did was everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, that’s life. It was a much more populist campaign.” In March, 2016, Leave.EU launched a “Back Off, Barack!” petition, asking President Obama to “butt out” of the Brexit debate. The following month, a Facebook post featured a thuggish group portrait of E.U. supporters, such as Angela Merkel and Tony Blair, calling them “The Hateful Eight.”</p><p>Banks, through his insurance businesses, had call centers at his disposal, and in “The Bad Boys of Brexit” he wrote that he planned to deploy these resources on behalf of Leave.EU. Something close to that appears to have happened. In February, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, which is owned by Banks, were collectively fined a hundred and twenty thousand pounds by the U.K. Information Commissioner, a regulator who monitors breaches of data privacy, because Leave.EU had sent hundreds of thousands of political advertisements to Eldon customers. Banks had appeared before Parliament and denied that Eldon employees had worked simultaneously on the political campaign—but, months later, he was countered by whistle-blowers. One former employee told the <em>Observer</em>, “I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t want to work on the political stuff. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I didn’t want to be complicit in it.” Another said, “Some of these images were really horrible. The immigrants and refugee stuff. But there were always these urgent requests coming in. You were told to stop what you were doing and do something for Leave.EU.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-6 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Banks disdains what he calls “professional politicians,” and in the months before the referendum he offended many of them, including some who were nominally on his side. He described Douglas Carswell, a Euroskeptic M.P. and a key figure within Vote Leave, as “borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in.” Leaders of Vote Leave, in turn, described Banks as “impossible.” Attempts to bring the two anti-E.U. groups together failed. Banks often publicly referred to Matthew Elliot, the chairman of Vote Leave, as Lord Elliot of Loserville. In February, 2016, after the London <em>Times</em> quoted unnamed Vote Leave sources accusing Leave.EU of being racist and homophobic, Banks threatened to sue Elliot.</p><p>Banks makes enemies easily. When his appearance before the parliamentary committee in June ran long, he refused to take any more questions, citing “a lunch appointment.” When the committee chair, Damian Collins, asked him to stay for five more minutes, Banks scolded Collins as if he were a child—“The word is ‘no’ ”—then walked out.</p><p>Banks, by his own admission, often irritated even his closest allies. He recalls that, after his insulting remarks about Carswell were published, Farage bellowed at him, “What the fuck have you done?”</p><p>Farage told me that Banks is “very pugnacious,” adding, “I’ve had plenty of screaming matches with him.” Banks and Wigmore, he said, “wouldn’t even answer the phone to me some days, I was so annoyed with them!”</p><p>Banks’s bulldozing style reflected his personality, but it was also a strategy. He told me, “We played the media like a Stradivarius,” noting that “if we spent eight million in the referendum, we got thirty-five, forty million in free publicity” by outraging liberal commentators. This tactic had an obvious model across the Atlantic. “We are going to be blunt, edgy, and controversial, Donald Trump-style,” Banks wrote in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” adding, “If BBC Producers aren’t spluttering organic muesli over their breakfast tables every morning, we won’t be doing our job.”</p><p>With days to go before the referendum, Farage unveiled a new <em class="small">ukip</em> poster. The words “<em class="small">breaking point</em>,” in giant red letters, were superimposed on a photograph of a snaking line of dark-skinned immigrants waiting to enter the E.U. Many observers denounced the poster as racist. A few hours after the launch, the Labour M.P. Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right nationalist, Thomas Mair, who shouted “Britain First” as he shot and stabbed her. Farage was pilloried.</p><p>Banks told me that Farage wanted to shelve the new campaign, but that he and Wigmore urged him to “hold his nerve.” Even after Cox’s death, he said, polls indicated that immigration remained “the No. 1 issue, by a runaway margin.” Banks told me that there was nothing wrong with the image or with its message. “It was a war,” he said. “Anything goes.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>When Cox was killed, both sides in the referendum battle agreed to a two-day pause in campaigning. But Channel 4 News recently unearthed e-mails from the day after the murder in which Banks instructed Leave.EU’s team to “keep pumping” and to “up the Spend” on a pro-Brexit Facebook video. Liz Bilney, Leave.EU’s C.E.O., agreed, noting that, with active campaigning halted, the video “could get a lot of take up.” Banks replied, “Exactly—press it harder.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-7 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>After the referendum, Leave’s competing factions scrambled to claim credit for the victory. Dominic Cummings, the key strategist in Vote Leave, believed that Farage and Leave.EU had been a “net drag” on the campaign. Banks told me that the social-media postings of Leave.EU reached working-class voters, particularly in the North of England, who would not otherwise have voted. Iain Dale, a broadcaster and a prominent Brexiteer, who published “Bad Boys,” told me that, if Leave.EU had been the official campaign, Leave would certainly have lost, but that “without a doubt” the two campaigns had dovetailed.</p><p>Ben Page, who runs the polling company Ipsos Mori, told me, “One can’t prove that the Banks money made the difference on its own. The key point is that when something is very close, as this was, anything can make a difference. Targeted Facebook advertising, the extra publicity, Farage, and the migrant poster—any or all of that could have swung it over the line. By having an official and unofficial Leave campaign, there was the ability to offer a respectable (sovereignty) and less respectable (migrant scum) argument simultaneously.”</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed callout--content-type--cartoon"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><div class="grid grid-items-0 responsive-cartoon asset-embed__responsive-asset"><a class="grid--item responsive-cartoon__image-link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22576-rd"><picture class="responsive-cartoon__image responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="A man on a deserted island loses his mind and thinks he has a talking bird for a best friend." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/190325_a22576_rd.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></a><figcaption class="caption grid--item responsive-cartoon__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">“Steve, I’m your best friend.

many months before the National Crime Agency concludes its investigation into the source of Banks’s donations to Leave-aligned groups. Given that Banks’s business life has been picaresque, and his financial history opaque, many questions may never be fully answered. For Remain-supporting Britons, the feeling of suspense is similar to that of Americans who yearn for the Mueller inquiry to reach its end, even though it may not offer the definitive evidence they crave.</p><p>Banks told me that in 1987, shortly after his first foray into local politics, he was given a junior position at Lloyd’s of London, the cornerstone of the British insurance industry; over a game of croquet, he’d impressed an acquaintance who worked there. Banks told me that he had recently become engaged to his first wife, Caroline, and needed a “proper job.” At Lloyd’s, he worked his way up in a car-insurance division by taking positions in unglamorous locations around England.</p><p>By the end of the nineties, he had started working for a small insurance firm, MotorCycle Direct, which had one office above a bakery in Thornbury, a town in western England. He was given a twenty-per-cent stake in the company, and in November, 2000, when he resigned and sold his shares, he had a quarter of a million pounds at his disposal.</p><p>During the next decade and a half, Banks became an entrepreneur, building a network of businesses, largely in insurance. His main office is in Bristol, and his best-known brand is GoSkippy, a company that promotes itself as offering “first-class insurance at the most competitive prices.” In 2017, the <em>Sunday Times</em> Rich List estimated Banks’s fortune to be about two hundred and fifty million pounds; Banks told me that he “broadly agrees” with this figure.</p><p>The <em>Financial Times</em> and others have suggested that this assessment is too high, but it’s hard to get a clear picture of Banks’s business dealings, because many of his firms are based in such “secrecy jurisdictions” as Gibraltar, the Isle of Man, and Bermuda. (Insurance companies are often based in offshore locations.) In the early part of this decade, Banks began branching out into other business sectors. In addition to the African diamond mines, he has invested in an iodine factory, a political consultancy, a wealth-management firm, an investigations-and-security firm, and a country-house resort, in the west of England, that is managed by his father.</p><div class="cne-interlude-embed"></div><p>Banks’s biggest windfall appears to have come in 2014, when he sold an insurance company called Brightside, receiving about twenty-two million pounds for his shares. Other Banks businesses have run into trouble. In 2013, Southern Rock, an insurance underwriter based in Gibraltar, was found by the local regulator to be operating with insufficient capital reserves. Since then, Banks and other shareholders have been compelled to refinance Southern Rock with many tens of millions of pounds. Banks has said that he has put more than forty million pounds into Southern Rock. The company addressed the shortfall, in part, by selling assets it owned to other firms in the Banks group—a strategy that has aroused suspicions among financial journalists, because such transactions are sometimes used as a screen for money laundering.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-8 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Banks told me, “The only thing that happened at Southern Rock was that we sold an asset for which we received cash in return.” He added, “The idea that there is any kind of magic going on is absurd.”</p><p>Recently, I spoke to Tom Keatinge, a former banker at J. P. Morgan who now works as a money-laundering expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank. Keatinge told me that, even when looking only at publicly available information about Banks’s businesses, “red flags do pop out all over the place.” The arrangement to refinance Southern Rock forms part of a pattern of investments and bailouts that seems to make little financial sense. “There appears, from an outside perspective, to be an attempt, at several points, to conjure value from thin air,” he said.</p><p>A 2017 <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/how-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit/&quot;}" href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/how-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a> by Open Democracy estimated that Banks’s empire had sustained enough losses that his gross earnings since 2001 were only about twenty-two million pounds. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at twenty-five million. As Open Democracy saw it, Banks had spent about “half his lifetime earnings” on political donations—“an amazingly generous amount.” The implication is that some of the money Banks invested in Brexit came from foreign, illegitimate sources.</p><p>“I’m an entrepreneur,” Banks told me. “With all due respect to journalists or anybody else, how the hell do they know what investments I’ve got? You know, I might be a good stock-market investor. I might own bonds.”</p><p>I asked him if he’d made significant profits through stocks or bonds. After a pause, he said, “Well, I’m pretty good. I’m not too shabby—put it that way.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In 1998, Banks divorced Caroline, and three years later he married Ekaterina (Katya) Paderina, who grew up in Yekaterinburg, east of the Ural Mountains. In interviews, Banks has recalled meeting Paderina in 2000, at a Britney Spears concert. The marriage was also Katya Banks’s second. In 1998, when she was twenty-five, she married a retired merchant seaman, Eric Butler. Recently, I visited Butler at his apartment in Portsmouth, a port city in southern England, and the site of a British Navy base. (According to a <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46460194&quot;}" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46460194" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BBC investigation</a>, an offshore company linked to Banks, Ural Properties, owns an apartment close to the naval base; Banks denies having any connection to Ural.) Now seventy-five, Butler speaks with a stutter, which was caused by a stroke, but he easily recalled dates, times, and events.</p><p>He told me that, in the summer of 1998, he met Paderina on Portsmouth’s waterfront, where she was sunbathing topless. He was fifty-four and divorced. When he asked her what she did before coming to Portsmouth, she said that she’d been living in Dubai, but had been “treated as a common prostitute” and deported. Official records in the Emirates confirm that she was deported. (Paderina, through Wigmore, declined to speak to <em>The New Yorker.</em> Banks would not comment on his wife’s activities in Dubai.)</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Butler and Paderina began a relationship. Butler wasn’t wealthy, he says, but he owned a “nice house,” and he promised to help Paderina pay for college. When she suggested that they get married, he asked if she was looking for love or for a passport. “Love,” she said.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-9 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>They were married within a few months. Butler recalls that, shortly after the ceremony, Paderina said, “ ‘I do not love you. I am not married to you in Russia. And, if you ever disobey me, you will feel the full force of my father’s connections.’ ” (She does not remember saying this.)</p><p>When Paderina’s parents flew in from Yekaterinburg for a visit, her father, Evgeny, told Butler that he worked in the “government property business.” According to Butler, he also boasted “about his connections with the Russian Mafia.” Paderina’s mother, Olga, worked at a language school, and her expertise seems to have benefitted Katya, who speaks six languages.</p><p>Butler said that Paderina often stayed out most of the night, without explanation. One day, he was surprised by a visit from police officers at the Special Branch, which is concerned with national security and intelligence. They questioned him about his wife’s daily activities and promised to return again. Later, Butler told me, the officers informed him that Paderina was depositing significant sums of money in private bank accounts. In 1999, he filed for divorce. Paderina attacked him with a lamp and was charged with assault. (Banks later told the <em>Sunday Times</em> that Paderina had acted in “self-defence.”)</p><p>In the time that he and Paderina were together, she became pregnant with their son, Darren, who is now eighteen, and who has been brought up by Katya and Arron Banks. Butler told me that he felt pressure from Darren not to disparage Katya, but that he also felt an imperative to tell the truth.</p><p>While Paderina’s marriage to Butler was ending, she learned that she was in danger of being deported from the U.K. She asked the local M.P., Mike Hancock, for help. They began spending time together; Butler accused them of having an affair. (They denied it.) Hancock, who is now in his seventies, has notably pro-Russian views. Indeed, in 2010 Hancock’s colleagues in a parliamentary group on Russian affairs became so disconcerted by his “pro-Putin and pro-Medvedev” agenda that they ousted him from a leadership role. Later that year, British security officials attempted to deport his parliamentary assistant, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, a young Russian with whom he had a four-year affair, because they suspected her of being a member of the S.V.R., Russia’s foreign-intelligence service. Zatuliveter had been observed with an S.V.R. officer in London; she also had relationships with a German <em class="small">nato</em> official and a Dutch diplomat.</p><p>Zatuliveter fought to stay in Britain. A special immigration panel concluded that, “on the balance of probabilities,” she was not a Russian agent.</p><p>Banks told me that insinuations that his wife, who helps to manage their family properties, had any connection with Russian espionage were preposterous. Katya, he said, was not even interested in politics. The license plate of her car—X MI5 SPY—is a knowing wink at her detractors. Banks did not comment on Katya’s relationship with Hancock, except to note that her interaction with him was routine: “She had overstayed her student visa, and so she wrote to her local M.P.”</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed callout--content-type--cartoon"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><div class="grid grid-items-0 responsive-cartoon asset-embed__responsive-asset"><a class="grid--item responsive-cartoon__image-link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22747"><picture class="responsive-cartoon__image responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="Two restaurant patrons become concerned after a waiter asks if everything is okay." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/190325_a22747.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></a><figcaption class="caption grid--item responsive-cartoon__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">“Yes, everything’s fine.

her family had Mafia or intelligence connections, arguing, “They would have been either very rich or very powerful—they were neither.” At the club, he observed, “If you’re <em>really</em> a spy, you don’t put ‘X MI5 SPY’ on the back of your car.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-10 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Recently, I spoke to Boris Volodarsky, who was a former undercover operative for the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency. He is now an academic authority on Russian espionage. In his opinion, Russian intelligence services—most likely the S.V.R.—“were in this or that way involved in the life and further career development” of Paderina and Zatuliveter. He told me that their activities reminded him of “swallows”—young Soviet women who sought to influence “important and promising foreign targets.” When I noted that Zatuliveter had officially been cleared of espionage, he told me that the judgment violated “all logic and common sense.” In 2011, he said, the British were naïve about the nature and scope of Russian intelligence in the Putin era. John Sipher, who retired, in 2014, from a twenty-eight-year career in the National Clandestine Service, which included a period in Moscow, told me that he also questioned the panel’s judgment, calling it “some of the worst analysis I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Banks has publicly acknowledged that his marriage to Katya has been fraught. In 2014, they consulted divorce lawyers, and Katya now lives with her mother, Olga. I asked him what it was like being married to a Russian, given Russia’s frosty relationship with Britain. “I’m not anti-Russian,” he told me. “I’m not particularly pro-Russian. I’m agnostic.”</p><p>But his public statements on Russian foreign policy have not been agnostic. He supported Putin’s 2014 military intervention in Crimea, saying that the invaded region was “as Russian as the Isle of Wight is British.” Leave.EU has also posted notably pro-Russian social-media content; it once hailed Putin for “wiping out <em class="small">isis</em> in Syria.” I asked Banks how he had felt when U.K. officials accused G.R.U. officers of poisoning Sergei Skripal, the Russian-British double agent, last year in Salisbury. He said, “My only reaction to the Skripal thing was that, having been involved in politics and seen the dirty tricks that go on, I’m naturally distrustful of <em>anything</em> I read in the media. Because there’s the usual agendas sitting behind that.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that, at a <em class="small">ukip</em> conference in September, 2015, he and Wigmore met a “shady character called Oleg,” who was introduced to them as “the First Secretary” at the Russian Embassy—“in other words, the KGB’s man in London.” “Oleg” is Alexander Udod, an S.V.R. officer who was ejected from Britain after the Skripal poisoning. Volodarksy, the former G.R.U. officer, suggested to me that Udod was also the S.V.R. agent who had met with Ekaterina Zatuliveter in London. (In Zatuliveter’s immigration hearing, she referred to the agent by one initial: “U.”)</p><p>Banks writes in his book that Udod invited him and Wigmore to lunch with the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, on November 6, 2015. They readily accepted. “You get invited by the Ambassador, of course you go!” Banks told me. “Maybe it was a mistake.”</p><p>“They weren’t perceived as bad back then,” Wigmore added. At the time, he said, British politicians were “actively trying to get people to invest in Russia.”</p><p>Wigmore later texted me to say that “The Bad Boys of Brexit” contained an error: he, not Udod, had suggested the embassy lunch. Another member of Banks’s circle, however, told me that the meeting was indeed arranged by Udod.</p><p>In any case, the embassy meeting was a riotous success. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks writes that he “hit it off from the word go” with the Russian delegation. Scheduled to last an hour, the meeting became a six-hour “boozy lunch,” and ended with Ambassador Yakovenko offering vodka from a bottle that had supposedly been made for Stalin.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>No other meetings with Russian diplomats or businessmen are described in “The Bad Boys of Brexit.” For more than a year, the public had the impression that this single lunch engagement was Banks’s only meeting with Ambassador Yakovenko. This wasn’t true. Banks told me that during the “boozy lunch” he mentioned owning diamond interests in southern Africa. Ambassador Yakovenko invited Banks to another meeting, later that November, at which a Russian businessman named Siman Povarenkin offered Banks a chance to invest in the consolidation of six gold mines in Russia—a multibillion-dollar deal. After that meeting, Banks wrote an e-mail to Povarenkin in which he said, “I am very bullish on gold so keen to have a look.” Banks relayed Povarenkin’s pitch to several associates, including Jim Mellon, the Leave.EU “ambassador.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-11 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Banks told me that, after consulting with several experts, including an investment banker named Nick van den Brul, he turned down Povarenkin’s proposal. But, according to a recent report by Channel 4, Banks had been enthusiastic about the gold deal. At his behest, a detailed pitch document was written, in which Banks and his partners expressed interest in overseeing the project. A subsequent e-mail from one of the partners suggested that Banks and his investors travel to Moscow to meet bankers from Sberbank—a lender with close ties to the Kremlin—to discuss “financial muscle.”</p><p>Four months before the referendum, van den Brul discussed with Banks the idea of investing in Alrosa, a diamond producer controlled by the Russian state, which was in the process of being partially privatized. In an e-mail, van den Brul said that doing so could “open up some opportunities.” Banks didn’t take up this offer, either. (A fund associated with Mellon did invest, but a representative said the fund’s specific investments were made without his knowledge.)</p><p>Two months before the referendum, a third opportunity to work with Russians was presented to Banks: a gold-mining project in Guinea, in West Africa, owned by Ilya Karas, a London-based Russian businessman with a Belizean passport. Karas had overseen an unsuccessful oil-infrastructure project in Russia, and he’d owned a bank in Djibouti.</p><p>Wigmore recently told me that Banks and Karas never met, saying, “When we checked it out, we decided not to proceed further.” Karas, however, told me that he met Banks in May, 2016, in Bristol. In the end, he said, Banks decided not to invest in the Guinean project.</p><p>“The whole point is that as a businessman you entertain and look at everything,” Banks told me. “You shouldn’t be judged on what you <em>don’t</em> do.” This is reasonable enough. Yet it is curious that at least three opportunities with Russians were dangled in front of him in the months before the referendum. The Labour M.P. Ben Bradshaw asked Parliament “why the Kremlin would offer Mr. Banks sweetheart deals.”</p><p>Banks told me that ambassadors often help arrange business deals between their home and host countries. Wigmore has said that, while serving as a trade envoy for Belize, he took part in many similar business discussions, and not just with Russians. But Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a career C.I.A. officer and a Russia expert who is now at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told me that Ambassador Yakovenko’s involvement in such meetings with Banks was suspicious. Mowatt-Larssen discounted the idea that an ambassador in a key post like London would set up business deals without the Kremlin’s awareness. He said that Russian ambassadors do exactly what “Putin or his closest advisers have asked them to do,” adding, “They are not foreign-ministry representatives as much as they are Putin’s representatives.”</p><p>Banks has said that he has never sought out investment in Russia, and that it is “absolute garbage” to suggest that he has taken money from Russians, or that Russian money had been funnelled into Brexit, or that he’d been influenced by Russian officials. If his encounters with Russians in 2015 and 2016 were actually part of an attempted influence campaign, he was at a loss to explain Putin’s motives. “I wonder what the Russians wanted from me?” he <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/world/europe/russia-britain-brexit-arron-banks.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/world/europe/russia-britain-brexit-arron-banks.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">asked</a> a reporter from the New York <em>Times</em>.</p><p>Given that Banks had become an ardent Brexit supporter by 2014, it seems unfair to suggest that Russian activities in 2015 and 2016 reframed his views. Yet Banks may not have given a full accounting of his interactions with Russians.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-12 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In 2013 and 2014, Banks bought major stakes in four diamond mines in South Africa and a license for exploration in Lesotho. The South African mines were small and largely exhausted. Two of the mines required millions of dollars of investment simply to resume operations. One is still dormant.</p><p>Banks told me that the mines had been bought cheaply. I asked several industry experts about Banks’s claim, in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” that the mines were so profitable that they helped prompt his sizable donation to <em class="small">ukip</em> in 2014. The experts told me that there’s scant chance of his having accrued any legitimate profits from the mines by the time he made his million-pound pledge.</p><p>So far, the most notable thing that the mines have produced is a vicious commercial dispute between Banks and his former partner in the mines, Chris Kimber. They have been making claims and counterclaims in a South African court. In a sworn statement, Kimber has claimed that Banks attempted to raise money from Russians, and that Banks put “enormous pressure” on him to obtain diamonds that would impress potential investors, even before the mines were fully operational. Kimber claims that Banks and his partners asked him to “find diamonds from third parties.” Banks denies all this, and alleges that Kimber defrauded him of his fair share of the diamonds produced by the mine.</p><p>No proof has emerged that Banks committed crimes in South Africa. But Brad Brooks-Rubin, a former State Department official who helps run the Sentry, a nonprofit group that monitors corruption in conflict zones, said that the diamond-mining industry “is almost <em>designed</em> to allow laundering.” Oversight was minimal, and mines were often sold through a “sight” system, without a proper audit of what each mine produced.</p><p>Recently, I spoke to someone with intimate knowledge of the business relationship between Banks and Kimber, who told me that, well before Banks met Ambassador Yakovenko, Banks sought Russian investment in his South African mines. (Wigmore says that Banks approached potential investors from various nations.) Banks, the source said, also attempted to invest in gold mines in Russia, and had travelled to Moscow to discuss potential deals.</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border

Banks has admitted to the BBC that he placed money in the private account of one of the politicians, but he denies that it was a bribe; he was merely making a political donation.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-13 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Thabane recently told the BBC that in August, 2014, when unrest forced him and another politician into exile in South Africa, Banks paid for their food and their lodgings. The Kimber affidavit also suggests that Banks was prepared to arrange “mercenary support” for allies in Lesotho, and had even collected guns for this purpose. The former colleague dismissed this as “bonfire talk,” and Banks strongly denied Kimber’s allegations. He told me that if any associates of his had collected weapons it was simply to protect his mining properties. “If you own a diamond mine, guess what?” he said. “People are going to raid it.”</p><p>Banks told me that Kimber was not to be trusted, because he was his opponent in a legal “scrap.” He also claimed that Kimber was himself under investigation in South Africa. A recent Channel 4 report maintains that, in 2017, an associate of Banks’s offered inducements to a Hawks officer in return for his opening an investigation into Kimber. (Wigmore acknowledged that Banks had asked the Hawks to investigate Kimber, but denied any impropriety.) The Hawks recently told me that they are not currently investigating either Kimber or Banks, having decided that, at least for now, the dispute between the men is a “civil matter.”</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t understand why journalists love this shit,” Banks said of his mines, batting away further questions. “Gold, diamonds, Trump, Russia—I mean, what’s <em>not</em> to like?”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">After Banks ordered another glass of white wine at the Mayfair club, he told me that he was fascinated by journalists. As a tribe, he said, they were often “so clever that they’re stupid”: reporters became so obsessed with fleshing out narratives aligned with their political sensibility that they couldn’t see an uncomplicated truth in front of their nose. Banks told me a story about visiting Mississippi, in August, 2016, with Farage, who spoke at one of Trump’s campaign rallies. Trump introduced him as “the man behind Brexit.”</p><p>“You could palpably feel the atmosphere,” Banks recalled. Despite polls to the contrary, he felt certain that Trump was going to win. It had been the same with Brexit, Banks said: “The journalists were, like, ‘This isn’t happening—we don’t want it to happen, therefore it <em>won’t</em> happen.’ ”</p><p>Banks suggested that the media’s inquiries into the source of his Leave donations, and into his connections with Russia, were desperate attempts to prove that the two great populist votes of 2016 had been illegitimate. Remainer journalists saw conspiracies where there were none.</p><p>This was its own conspiracy theory, of course. The truth is likely to be more complicated. Banks may not be a Russian asset, but the Russians have clearly courted him for years. Banks, meanwhile, has insistently misled British reporters and investigators about the nature of his relationship with the Russians, to the point that it seems fair to wonder if yet more connections will emerge. And one thing is clear: although Russia does not seem to have achieved anything like the success it did by stealing Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, it certainly attempted to interfere in British affairs.</p><p>In the view of some seasoned observers of Putin’s disinformation campaigns, the Russians may be pleased to have had their discussions with Banks exposed: the revelations have compromised him in the eyes of many Britons, sowing greater division in the U.K. Peter Pomerantsev, the author of “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,” a book about Russian propaganda, has no specific knowledge about the Banks case, but he told me that such techniques have been used since Soviet times. “There is a great word to describe it, <em>zapachkat</em>—it means to ‘besmirch,’ or ‘make someone dirty,’ ” Pomerantsev said. “Getting caught seems like half the trick.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-14 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>One journalist who brought Banks’s meetings with Russians to light is Carole Cadwalladr, of the <em>Observer</em>, whose reporting has led to numerous Brexit-related scoops. Banks spoke briefly, and snidely, to me about her work; without citing examples, he said that it was riddled with errors, in part because she saw deep ties where there were only glancing connections. He depicted Cadwalladr as a lonely woman staring at a corkboard on which pinned names were connected with string in a complicated pattern of zigzags, as in a detective show.</p><p>Banks then talked about his relationship with Steve Bannon. According to some reports, they are co-conspirators: right-wing vandals who have caused mayhem in Britain and America on behalf of shadowy paymasters, and who are themselves connected, through Cambridge Analytica. In a leaked 2015 e-mail between Bannon and Banks, the two discussed whether it might be possible to raise funds for the Brexit project in the U.S. before the official Brexit campaign began. (If foreign funds had been raised <em>during</em> the campaign, this would have been illegal.) Banks, however, insisted that his discussions with Bannon were insignificant, and that they hardly meant that he and Bannon were friends.</p><p>“We <em>dislike</em> him!” Wigmore added.</p><p>When Banks, Wigmore, Farage, and others from the Brexit campaign made their November, 2016, visit to Trump Tower, Bannon was present. Banks told me that, before his party went up to see Trump, Bannon attempted to extract from him a forty-thousand-pound payment. Ostensibly, this request was related to work done by Cambridge Analytica for Leave.EU, but, given the context, it seems almost as if Bannon were charging an admission fee to see the President-elect. (A source close to Bannon called this idea “preposterous.”) Banks told me that he refused, saying that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t performed any services for Leave.EU. This riled Bannon, but Farage placated him, and the Brexit entourage met with Trump, in his apartment, without money changing hands. Trump, Banks told me, was “thoughtful, pleasant, almost polite, and funny.”</p><p>I asked Banks what kind of Cambridge Analytica services Bannon had offered in 2015. At the time, the company was touting itself as an expert in microtargeting voters, with access to millions of people’s “psychographic” information. This cache of data was later found to have been improperly culled from Facebook.</p><p>“They put an offer to me that was sort of contemptible,” Banks said. He was asked to give “a million, up front,” for voter-targeting suggestions, which would be based on an algorithm derived from the Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica promised that the results would help Leave.EU “raise six or seven million pounds for the campaign.” Banks looked at me and said, “We turned it down.”</p><p>Why? Banks laughed, and the half smile broke into a full one. “Because it was illegal,” he said. ♦</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div></div><div role="none"><div role="none"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__truncation-message article__body grid-layout__content"><div class="container container--body"><div class="container--body-inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article><div class="content-footer"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><footer class="grid--item content-footer__magazine-disclaimer grid-layout__content">Published in the print edition of the<!-- --> <a href="/magazine/2019/03/25">March 25, 2019</a>, issue<!-- -->, with the headline “Bad Boy.”</footer></div><div class="row"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="contributors contributors--no-bottom-line grid--item grid-layout__content"><div class="contributor-bio contributor-bio--align-left contributors__contributor-bio"><div class="contributor-bio__responsive-image"><a href="/contributors/ed-caesar"><span class="responsive-asset"><picture class="responsive-image"><img alt="" class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_240%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cd9d4c2be7ba046c63474ea/1:1/w_240%2Cc_limit/ed_caesar.png 240w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></span></a></div><div class="contributor-bio__content"><div class="contributor-bio__bio"><a href="/contributors/ed-caesar">Ed Caesar</a> is a contributing writer to The New Yorker.

The shocking result of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union had just been announced: [Leave had won](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fbrexit).\n\nBanks, an entrepreneur whose fortune comes primarily from owning insurance companies, had financed and directed the most aggressive wing of the Leave campaign, Leave.EU, and he had given or loaned a total of thirteen million dollars to various anti-E.U. causes. In Britain, where campaign-spending laws have historically been stringent, and donations modest by American standards, Banks’s contributions are thought to constitute the largest sum ever donated by an individual to a political campaign. Banks, who is fifty-two, is short and moonfaced, and often talks with a mischievous half smile; Wigmore, a former Conservative Party operative who serves as Banks’s communications chief, also fifty-two, has floppy black hair and a chaotic manner. Virtually inseparable, and prone to boyish humor, they refer to each other as Banksy and Wiggy.\n\nAlthough the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers [Boris Johnson](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fboris-johnson) and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave’s victory was in many ways *his* victory. He had given considerable financial support to [Nigel Farage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fnigel-farage), the sharp-tongued Euroskeptic, which had allowed Farage to remain at the center of the Brexit debate. Many experts also believed that the rambunctious Leave.EU campaign—which stoked fears of uncontrolled immigration—had roused voters who had been unmoved by the more technocratic messages of Vote Leave. A typical Leave.EU post on Facebook warned voters that “*immigration without assimilation equals invasion.*{: .small}” A post about the dangers of “free movement” within the E.U. was accompanied by a photograph of ticking explosives.\n\nThat night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage’s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames. Farage called the referendum “a victory for ordinary people,” adding, “We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption, and deceit.” He concluded, “Let June the twenty-third go down in our history as our Independence Day\\!”\n\nShortly after 5 *a.m*{: .small}., Banks and Wigmore took the champagne and headed for a friend’s apartment, to shower and change before making media appearances. On the way, they spotted an old man, in a tattered Barbour jacket, attempting to withdraw large sums of money from an A.T.M. The old man recognized them. He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next.\n\nBanks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such “lies.” A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity. Laughing, they assured the man that nothing of the sort would happen. Banks handed him the bottle of champagne, and urged him to celebrate. As Banks recalled it, “He genuinely thought the world was going to come to an end\\!”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks told me this story, alongside Wigmore, on a rainy November afternoon two and a half years later, at 5 Hertford Street—a private member’s club, in Mayfair, where male guests are required to wear a formal jacket. The Brexit project that they had so ardently supported had left the U.K. in a state of panic. The government of Prime Minister [Theresa May](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Ftheresa-may) had almost imploded several times. The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain’s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn’t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as “no deal,” would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine.\n\nThis outcome was Banks’s preferred result. “No deal means we *leave*,” he told me at the club.\n\nBanks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency—Britain’s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners’ money in electoral campaigns. “A number of criminal offences may have been committed,” the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks’s and Bilney’s stories had “changed over time,” and that what they told the commission was “not consistent” with company records. (Bilney says that this “evolvement of response” can be ascribed to the commission’s failure to understand “our business structures.”)\n\nA sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency’s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote. Although President [Vladimir Putin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fvladimir-putin) has claimed that Russia was ambivalent about the Brexit referendum, he recently pressed May to “fulfill the will” of the British people and rule out a second referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the E.U.—which, polls suggest, would lead to a narrow win for Remain. Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin’s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea.\n\nAccording to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a “regime-change agenda” around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin’s regime might be targeted next. “Russia felt they needed to push back hard,” Weiss told me. “They wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that’s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and—I think—their support of Brexit fits in.”\n\nBanks’s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent “ambassador” for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a “friend and business partner,” made much of his money by investing in Russia. (A representative for Mellon denied that Mellon has had a “close business or professional relationship” with Banks.) Banks’s 2016 memoir, “[The Bad Boys of Brexit](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FBad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum\u002Fdp\u002F1785901826\u002Fref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=),” acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London. Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency’s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks’s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, “There are still so many questions unanswered about Banks—where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07]\n\n+++\n\nThe government of the U.K. has been strikingly muted in its response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats. According to various reports, in the early months of 2016, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, she refused a request by British intelligence services to investigate Banks’s conduct. Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports—including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people’s choice and must be enforced. Given the tensions surrounding the referendum, she is unlikely to invite further probes into the financial background of one of the Leave campaign’s key players. Doing so would be tantamount to using a grenade in a pub brawl.\n\nIn Parliament, however, both Labour and Conservative members have repeatedly questioned whether Banks’s dealings with the Russians in the lead-up to the referendum amounted to an influence campaign by a foreign power. In November, 2018, when the National Crime Agency investigation was announced, David Lammy, a Labour M.P., demanded that Britain’s departure from the E.U. be “put on hold until we know the extent of these crimes against our democracy.” Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, has called for a “[Mueller-style inquiry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fmueller-investigation)” into whether the “referendum result was stolen.” The Conservative M.P. Damian Collins has demanded a broader inquiry into Russian interference in British affairs. In an interview at his office in the Houses of Parliament, he told me that he had serious concerns about the source of Banks’s funds. “The reason the questions persist is that he seems to own a number of businesses that don’t make any money,” Collins said. “There’s never really been a clear explanation from him about the funding of these campaigns.”\n\nBanks recently sent Collins’s constituents a letter calling him a “disgrace” and a “snake in the grass.” In an op-ed, Collins responded that he would not be cowed by Banks’s “bullyboy tactics.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks’s affairs have also fallen under scrutiny outside the U.K. Banks, Wigmore, and Farage came to public attention in the U.S. shortly after the 2016 elections, when they were photographed with President-elect [Donald Trump](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) outside his apartment in Trump Tower. A few days later, in London, Banks and Wigmore again met with the Russian Ambassador, recounting their meeting with Trump and passing on contact details for members of Trump’s transition team. The British Web site Open Democracy has also reported that, as early as October, 2015, Banks asked [Steve Bannon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fsteve-bannon), who later became the head of Trump’s campaign, for help in exploring possible sources of American funding for Leave.EU. (Banks says that this effort never progressed.)\n\nLate last year, [e-mails leaked to the *Observer*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fuk-news\u002F2018\u002Fnov\u002F17\u002Farron-banks-emails-steve-bannon-brexit-campaign-funds) revealed that Leave.EU had misrepresented to British investigators the extent of its ties to Cambridge Analytica, the now disgraced and insolvent British data firm funded by the American political donor [Robert Mercer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Frobert-mercer) to microtarget voters. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks flatly states that Leave.EU had “hired Cambridge Analytica.” He later insisted that his group had held only “preliminary discussions” with the firm, and never paid it anything; he repeated this claim to me. But the leaked e-mails show that discussions extended into 2016—beyond what Banks had previously admitted. Bannon is copied on some of these e-mails; in one of them, Banks writes that he “would like to get CA on the team, maybe look at the first cut of the data.” When news of the e-mails broke, Collins called them evidence of “direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump,” and redoubled his campaign to establish a broad-ranging inquiry.\n\n[Adam Schiff](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fadam-schiff), the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that there were “parallels and interconnections in abundance” between the apparent Russian efforts to influence Brexit and the well-documented, and possibly decisive, Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election. He described Putin’s ambassadors in D.C. and in London as conduits of “malign influence.” According to an American lawyer with knowledge of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Banks and Farage have become persons of interest in that inquiry. (This is “bollocks,” Wigmore said.)\n\nIn December, two South African intelligence officials confirmed to me that Banks, who owns an array of businesses in southern Africa, including several diamond mines, had been the subject of two investigations by the Hawks, South Africa’s version of the F.B.I. The first case involved looking into whether Banks used his diamond mines in South Africa to launder stones from other parts of Africa—a process known as “salting the mines.” The second explored whether Banks, or people close to him, acquired automatic weapons without a license during a period of political upheaval in Lesotho; this investigation was opened by a branch of the Hawks known as Crimes Against the State.\n\n-=-=-=-\nConsidering all these investigations, Banks and Wigmore were in oddly high spirits when we met. Banks drank white wine; Wigmore, gin-and-tonic. They frequently reduced each other to gales of laughter with a joke or a reminiscence, and they found it both surreal and amusing to be figures of suspicion on three continents. A few days before the meeting, Wigmore sent me a text about the lives that he and Banks had been leading since the Brexit vote: “It’s a film a book and a thriller rolled into one lol.” He appended to the message the crying-laughing-face emoji.\n\nBanks dismissed much of the reporting about him as overheated Remainer fantasy—the product of journalists and media proprietors who had been “driven crazy by Brexit.” This argument echoes Trump’s claim that Americans who express concerns about his campaign’s communications with Russian officials are just displacing their rage over his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Banks said that he’d given money to a campaign in an entirely legal way, and now he was being punished for having been effective. All the criminal investigations were similarly motivated by politics. One could not trust the Electoral Commission to act fairly when it referred him to the National Crime Agency, he said, because the commission was filled with Remain supporters. Brexit itself was at risk, Banks warned me, because most M.P.s were Remainers, as were many powerful people outside Parliament.\n\nFor all his bonhomie, there was a sinister aspect to Banks’s embattled outlook. Leave.EU’s social-media feed, which is overseen by Banks, often parroted the alt-right view that liberal global élites exert an outsized sway over politics and the media. Two recent posts by Leave.EU had featured images of the financier [George Soros](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fgeorge-soros), a target of anti-Semitic hatred and a focus of right-wing conspiracy theories. In one post, Soros was pictured as a puppet master controlling Tony Blair; the image echoed a Nazi propaganda poster of the nineteen-forties, in which a Jewish man controls Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin with strings.\n\nDuring our meeting, Banks spoke scathingly of the Web site Open Democracy, which has published detailed articles on Banks’s business dealings and political activities. The site is partly funded by Soros. In October, three days after a pipe bomb was discovered at Soros’s house in Connecticut, Banks tweeted, “I suppose there are good Jews and bad Jews, then George Soros.”\n\nIn our conversations, it was obvious that Banks read widely—including publications that he professes to hate, such as the liberal *Financial Times*—and that he was capable of nuanced political thought. For instance, he was able to disentangle his support of British unionism—the idea that England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should not break apart—from his opposition to the E.U., an argument that some right-wing M.P.s might have struggled with. At other times, he came across as willfully obtuse, the product of an alt-right echo chamber. He used Trumpian language about the nefarious motives of the “deep state.” In Banks’s mind, there was no doubt that important news reached the public only at times most conducive to the interests of powerful but unseen forces. At one point in our conversation, Banks suggested that behind-the-scenes figures in Britain had deliberately provoked American anxieties about the 2016 election. “Part of the whole Trump-Russia thing, and also with the [Steele dossier](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2018\u002F03\u002F12\u002Fchristopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier), it’s absolutely the case that some of those rumors came out of the British intelligence services,” he told me. “I think there are going to be revelations along that line.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nBanks first came to national attention in Britain in October, 2014, when he announced a large donation to the U.K. Independence Party, or *ukip*{: .small}, which was led by Nigel Farage at the time. Until then, Banks said, he had been a modest donor to the Conservative Party, giving about two hundred thousand pounds.\n\nIn “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that Farage phoned him after an introductory lunch, asking him if he would contribute a hundred thousand pounds to *ukip*{: .small}. Farage planned to make news by announcing that a Conservative donor had defected to *ukip*{: .small}. Banks said yes. “My businesses in this country and overseas, where I own a number of diamond mines, were doing very well,” he writes. “I wanted to give something back, and help the fight to get Britain out of the E.U.”\n\nOn the morning that the donation was made, the former Conservative leader William Hague told reporters that he’d never heard of Arron Banks. The snub riled Banks so much that he decided to increase his donation to a million pounds.\n\n“Hague called me a nobody,” Banks said. “Now he knows who I am.”\n\nThe details of Banks’s life before he gate-crashed British politics are difficult to piece together, in part because he has told conflicting versions of his life story. When questioned by a parliamentary committee in June, Banks admitted to frequently telling lies, noting, “We certainly weren’t above leading journalists up the country path, making fun of them—same with politicians.”\n\nIn his book, Banks writes that he “grew up in Durban,” in South Africa. “[All Out War,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAll-Out-War-Britains-Political\u002Fdp\u002F0008215154\u002Fref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)” a definitive account of the E.U. referendum by the British journalist Tim Shipman, similarly asserts that Banks spent his “early life” in South Africa. But Banks told me that although his father worked in the sugar trade abroad, mostly in southern and eastern Africa, he had remained behind in England, where his mother lived, and that until the age of eleven or twelve he had attended a “local school.”\n\nWhat is beyond doubt is that, at around the age of twelve, Banks was sent to a tumbledown boarding school in Berkshire, England, called Crookham Court. At the end of each term, he told me, he was flown to wherever his father was then working—South Africa, Swaziland, Somalia—as if he were an “Army brat.” This peripatetic childhood seems to have informed his later politics. Banks shares with some other Brexiteers an imperial nostalgia. He has spoken publicly about his love of the Commonwealth—the group of nations that are mostly former colonies of the British Empire—and of feeling more at home with Anglo-Saxon “kith and kin,” such as white Australians and South Africans, than with other kinds of foreigners. During our interview, I noticed that Banks pronounces “Kenya” with a long “e”—a pronunciation, still used by some white Kenyans, that was customary before Kenya gained its independence, in 1963. Banks denies being racist but admits to being “tribal.”\n\nIn 1989, some years after Banks left Crookham Court, a BBC documentary exposed the owner of the school, Philip Cadman, as a pedophile, and the school shut down. Several other former teachers have since been imprisoned for abusing boys. But Banks told me that he had “no issues” at the school and had a “lovely time.” In 2013, he posted angry messages on a Facebook page for former pupils, decrying the “victim culture” of the people sharing their stories, and accusing one student of “crying over spilt milk.” In the same exchange, he said, “I abhor homosexuality and abuse of any kind,” before clarifying his position: “Re homosexuality—I’m just old fashioned and don’t like it sorry.” Banks says that he acted as a character witness for Cadman at Cadman’s trial, in 1990. When I suggested that this was an odd thing for him to do, Banks said, “It shows my independent streak. He was a decorated war hero. I was asked to say what did I think. I can only say what I thought, which was: I saw nothing.” Cadman was found guilty, and spent several years in prison.\n\nIan Mucklejohn, who taught Banks English at Crookham Court, and has since written a book, “[Had](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FHad-Tragedy-Crookham-School-Fiction\u002Fdp\u002F1782204008),” about the abuse scandal, told me that it was obvious from Banks’s school essays that his political outlook was “really quite reactionary—very fixed, and firm.” Mucklejohn suggested that Banks’s lack of sympathy toward victims was a sign of emotional damage. Even students who hadn’t been molested, Mucklejohn writes in his book, had been “brutalised by a regime in which physical abuse and absence of human feeling became the norm.”\n\nBanks, who told me that he was expelled from both Crookham Court and a subsequent school for a “variety of offenses,” did not go to college. Instead, he worked as a door-to-door salesman near his mother’s house, in Basingstoke, southwest of London; after a while, he became a real-estate agent. He has [told](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newstatesman.com\u002Fpolitics\u002Fuk\u002F2016\u002F10\u002Farron-banks-man-who-bought-brexit) the *New Statesman* that he became “quite good at persuading people to buy things they didn’t want to buy.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5c8c1973a9c5cd2cbc9a0654]\n\n+++\n\nIn 1987, at the age of twenty-one, Banks unsuccessfully campaigned to become a Conservative member of a local council in Basingstoke. The next year, he tried and failed again. Even then, Banks used unusual tactics to woo voters. In his first election, he bought himself a golden Labrador, and took the dog with him, door to door. “My strategy was to basically chat up all the housewives,” he told me.\n\nBanks campaigned as a law-and-order candidate, at a time when there were pronounced nationwide tensions between the black community and the police force, which was predominantly white. In 1985, a white policeman had been killed during a race riot in the Tottenham area of London. Banks printed inflammatory flyers reminding voters that the Labour M.P. for Tottenham, Bernie Grant, had allegedly said that the police had received “a good hiding” in the riots. (Grant, who is of Guyanese origin, claimed to have been misquoted.) Banks distributed the leaflets in Basingstoke neighborhoods where many police officers lived. The Labour Party was incensed that a young Conservative was dredging up such a divisive, contested, and non-local issue.\n\nBanks recalled, with a chuckle, “We got in big trouble over those leaflets.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nAt the Mayfair club, the conversation approached its third hour, and noisy patrons crowded nearby tables. Wigmore offered Banks a cigarette, which seemed to loosen him up: the smoke, like his answers, poured from the side of his mouth. After the Basingstoke campaigns, Banks told me, he occasionally considered taking a more active role in British politics. In the late two-thousands, he nearly put himself forward as a potential parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party. But his political activism took a radical turn after he met Farage and made his first donation to *ukip*{: .small}. In his view, the E.U. was unjust: he told me that Britain had been “held prisoner” by Brussels.\n\nAfter the general election of 2015, when David Cameron promised an E.U. referendum, Banks and Farage believed that the mainstream anti-E.U. politicians, most of whom came from the ruling Conservative Party, were timid and slow to mobilize. These “Euroskeptic” Conservatives, they felt, wanted to freeze Farage out of the discussion, convinced that his rhetoric would antagonize swing voters. According to Shipman’s “All Out War,” in the summer of 2015 Banks gave Farage “a voice” by funding an alternative Leave movement, which became known as Leave.EU. Among other things, Banks and Farage hoped to pressure the establishment campaign for Leave into intensifying its rhetoric.\n\nBritain is now so polarized by Brexit that it’s hard to credit that there were once good-faith arguments on both sides of the debate. Remain proponents are caricatured as cosmopolitan élites who are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary voters. The Leave side is often portrayed as a quasi-racist movement whose sole aim is to foment hostility toward foreigners. But even if, as many experts suspect, implementing Brexit proves harmful, many proponents of Leave had legitimate complaints about the E.U., which they believed to be a sclerotic and overweening supranational body.\n\nHowever, even when there was an intellectual argument for Leave, there was sometimes an ugly subtext. I spent the evening of the referendum vote reporting from a pub in a poor post-industrial town in Yorkshire, in the North of England. White Leave-voting patrons complained to me that Muslims had changed their community, and that they wanted to “get my country back.” They understood that leaving the E.U. would not solve the perceived problem—the Pakistanis and Indians in their town were second- or third-generation immigrants—but they saw the referendum vote as a way to register a festering grievance.\n\nSubsequent research has reinforced this kind of anecdotal evidence. In 2016, social psychologists from Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted a study of referendum voters, and found that support for Brexit correlated with “collective narcissism”—a belief in the unparalleled greatness of one’s country—and with a heightened fear of immigrants. One of the researchers, Agnieszka Golec de Zavala, [told](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.independent.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fscience\u002Fbrexit-prejudice-scientists-link-foreigners-immigrants-racism-xenophobia-leave-eu-a8078586.html) the *Independent*, “The Leave campaign gave a new, acceptable way to express xenophobia.”\n\nIn September, 2015, Banks hired the American pollster Gerry Gunster as a consultant. Banks has frequently cited some advice that Gunster gave him: referendums are won on emotion, not on facts. (Gunster told me that this was a mischaracterization: he counselled Banks that “emotional appeal *must accompany* facts.”) Accordingly, Leave.EU played heavily on the British people’s concerns about immigration in a way that Vote Leave was loath to do, at least until the end of the campaign, for fear of discouraging moderate voters.\n\nIn some ways, the campaign that Banks led was an insurgent protest movement against the smug globalism of the ruling class—against the “big politics” that Farage decried in his victory speech. But it was also a campaign that blew dog whistles. Within two days of the mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida, Leave.EU had tweeted a photograph of *isis*{: .small} fighters alongside this message: “The free movement of Kalashnikovs in Europe helps terrorists. Vote for greater security on June 23. Vote \\#Leave.” Accompanying text—“Act now before we see an Orlando-style atrocity here before too long”—made the exploitation of the Florida tragedy explicit.\n\nFarage told me recently that Leave.EU, as a nonofficial platform, had some strategic advantages over the mainstream Leave campaign. “Banks created content that was very different in nature to what the establishment Conservative politicians were doing,” he said. “It had more humor. It had more edge. Not everything they did was everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, that’s life. It was a much more populist campaign.” In March, 2016, Leave.EU launched a “Back Off, Barack\\!” petition, asking President Obama to “butt out” of the Brexit debate. The following month, a Facebook post featured a thuggish group portrait of E.U. supporters, such as Angela Merkel and Tony Blair, calling them “The Hateful Eight.”\n\nBanks, through his insurance businesses, had call centers at his disposal, and in “The Bad Boys of Brexit” he wrote that he planned to deploy these resources on behalf of Leave.EU. Something close to that appears to have happened. In February, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, which is owned by Banks, were collectively fined a hundred and twenty thousand pounds by the U.K. Information Commissioner, a regulator who monitors breaches of data privacy, because Leave.EU had sent hundreds of thousands of political advertisements to Eldon customers. Banks had appeared before Parliament and denied that Eldon employees had worked simultaneously on the political campaign—but, months later, he was countered by whistle-blowers. One former employee told the *Observer*, “I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t want to work on the political stuff. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I didn’t want to be complicit in it.” Another said, “Some of these images were really horrible. The immigrants and refugee stuff. But there were always these urgent requests coming in. You were told to stop what you were doing and do something for Leave.EU.”\n\nBanks disdains what he calls “professional politicians,” and in the months before the referendum he offended many of them, including some who were nominally on his side. He described Douglas Carswell, a Euroskeptic M.P. and a key figure within Vote Leave, as “borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in.” Leaders of Vote Leave, in turn, described Banks as “impossible.” Attempts to bring the two anti-E.U. groups together failed. Banks often publicly referred to Matthew Elliot, the chairman of Vote Leave, as Lord Elliot of Loserville. In February, 2016, after the London *Times* quoted unnamed Vote Leave sources accusing Leave.EU of being racist and homophobic, Banks threatened to sue Elliot.\n\nBanks makes enemies easily. When his appearance before the parliamentary committee in June ran long, he refused to take any more questions, citing “a lunch appointment.” When the committee chair, Damian Collins, asked him to stay for five more minutes, Banks scolded Collins as if he were a child—“The word is ‘no’&nbsp;”—then walked out.\n\nBanks, by his own admission, often irritated even his closest allies. He recalls that, after his insulting remarks about Carswell were published, Farage bellowed at him, “What the fuck have you done?”\n\nFarage told me that Banks is “very pugnacious,” adding, “I’ve had plenty of screaming matches with him.” Banks and Wigmore, he said, “wouldn’t even answer the phone to me some days, I was so annoyed with them\\!”\n\nBanks’s bulldozing style reflected his personality, but it was also a strategy. He told me, “We played the media like a Stradivarius,” noting that “if we spent eight million in the referendum, we got thirty-five, forty million in free publicity” by outraging liberal commentators. This tactic had an obvious model across the Atlantic. “We are going to be blunt, edgy, and controversial, Donald Trump-style,” Banks wrote in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” adding, “If BBC Producers aren’t spluttering organic muesli over their breakfast tables every morning, we won’t be doing our job.”\n\nWith days to go before the referendum, Farage unveiled a new *ukip*{: .small} poster. The words “*breaking point*{: .small},” in giant red letters, were superimposed on a photograph of a snaking line of dark-skinned immigrants waiting to enter the E.U. Many observers denounced the poster as racist. A few hours after the launch, the Labour M.P. Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right nationalist, Thomas Mair, who shouted “Britain First” as he shot and stabbed her. Farage was pilloried.\n\nBanks told me that Farage wanted to shelve the new campaign, but that he and Wigmore urged him to “hold his nerve.” Even after Cox’s death, he said, polls indicated that immigration remained “the No. 1 issue, by a runaway margin.” Banks told me that there was nothing wrong with the image or with its message. “It was a war,” he said. “Anything goes.”\n\nWhen Cox was killed, both sides in the referendum battle agreed to a two-day pause in campaigning. But Channel 4 News recently unearthed e-mails from the day after the murder in which Banks instructed Leave.EU’s team to “keep pumping” and to “up the Spend” on a pro-Brexit Facebook video. Liz Bilney, Leave.EU’s C.E.O., agreed, noting that, with active campaigning halted, the video “could get a lot of take up.” Banks replied, “Exactly—press it harder.”\n\nAfter the referendum, Leave’s competing factions scrambled to claim credit for the victory. Dominic Cummings, the key strategist in Vote Leave, believed that Farage and Leave.EU had been a “net drag” on the campaign. Banks told me that the social-media postings of Leave.EU reached working-class voters, particularly in the North of England, who would not otherwise have voted. Iain Dale, a broadcaster and a prominent Brexiteer, who published “Bad Boys,” told me that, if Leave.EU had been the official campaign, Leave would certainly have lost, but that “without a doubt” the two campaigns had dovetailed.\n\nBen Page, who runs the polling company Ipsos Mori, told me, “One can’t prove that the Banks money made the difference on its own. The key point is that when something is very close, as this was, anything can make a difference. Targeted Facebook advertising, the extra publicity, Farage, and the migrant poster—any or all of that could have swung it over the line. By having an official and unofficial Leave campaign, there was the ability to offer a respectable (sovereignty) and less respectable (migrant scum) argument simultaneously.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c1a]\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\nIt may be many months before the National Crime Agency concludes its investigation into the source of Banks’s donations to Leave-aligned groups. Given that Banks’s business life has been picaresque, and his financial history opaque, many questions may never be fully answered. For Remain-supporting Britons, the feeling of suspense is similar to that of Americans who yearn for the Mueller inquiry to reach its end, even though it may not offer the definitive evidence they crave.\n\nBanks told me that in 1987, shortly after his first foray into local politics, he was given a junior position at Lloyd’s of London, the cornerstone of the British insurance industry; over a game of croquet, he’d impressed an acquaintance who worked there. Banks told me that he had recently become engaged to his first wife, Caroline, and needed a “proper job.” At Lloyd’s, he worked his way up in a car-insurance division by taking positions in unglamorous locations around England.\n\nBy the end of the nineties, he had started working for a small insurance firm, MotorCycle Direct, which had one office above a bakery in Thornbury, a town in western England. He was given a twenty-per-cent stake in the company, and in November, 2000, when he resigned and sold his shares, he had a quarter of a million pounds at his disposal.\n\nDuring the next decade and a half, Banks became an entrepreneur, building a network of businesses, largely in insurance. His main office is in Bristol, and his best-known brand is GoSkippy, a company that promotes itself as offering “first-class insurance at the most competitive prices.” In 2017, the *Sunday Times* Rich List estimated Banks’s fortune to be about two hundred and fifty million pounds; Banks told me that he “broadly agrees” with this figure.\n\nThe *Financial Times* and others have suggested that this assessment is too high, but it’s hard to get a clear picture of Banks’s business dealings, because many of his firms are based in such “secrecy jurisdictions” as Gibraltar, the Isle of Man, and Bermuda. (Insurance companies are often based in offshore locations.) In the early part of this decade, Banks began branching out into other business sectors. In addition to the African diamond mines, he has invested in an iodine factory, a political consultancy, a wealth-management firm, an investigations-and-security firm, and a country-house resort, in the west of England, that is managed by his father.\n\nBanks’s biggest windfall appears to have come in 2014, when he sold an insurance company called Brightside, receiving about twenty-two million pounds for his shares. Other Banks businesses have run into trouble. In 2013, Southern Rock, an insurance underwriter based in Gibraltar, was found by the local regulator to be operating with insufficient capital reserves. Since then, Banks and other shareholders have been compelled to refinance Southern Rock with many tens of millions of pounds. Banks has said that he has put more than forty million pounds into Southern Rock. The company addressed the shortfall, in part, by selling assets it owned to other firms in the Banks group—a strategy that has aroused suspicions among financial journalists, because such transactions are sometimes used as a screen for money laundering.\n\nBanks told me, “The only thing that happened at Southern Rock was that we sold an asset for which we received cash in return.” He added, “The idea that there is any kind of magic going on is absurd.”\n\nRecently, I spoke to Tom Keatinge, a former banker at J.&nbsp;P. Morgan who now works as a money-laundering expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank. Keatinge told me that, even when looking only at publicly available information about Banks’s businesses, “red flags do pop out all over the place.” The arrangement to refinance Southern Rock forms part of a pattern of investments and bailouts that seems to make little financial sense. “There appears, from an outside perspective, to be an attempt, at several points, to conjure value from thin air,” he said.\n\nA 2017 [report](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.opendemocracy.net\u002Fen\u002Fopendemocracyuk\u002Fhow-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit\u002F) by Open Democracy estimated that Banks’s empire had sustained enough losses that his gross earnings since 2001 were only about twenty-two million pounds. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at twenty-five million. As Open Democracy saw it, Banks had spent about “half his lifetime earnings” on political donations—“an amazingly generous amount.” The implication is that some of the money Banks invested in Brexit came from foreign, illegitimate sources.\n\n“I’m an entrepreneur,” Banks told me. “With all due respect to journalists or anybody else, how the hell do they know what investments I’ve got? You know, I might be a good stock-market investor. I might own bonds.”\n\nI asked him if he’d made significant profits through stocks or bonds. After a pause, he said, “Well, I’m pretty good. I’m not too shabby—put it that way.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn 1998, Banks divorced Caroline, and three years later he married Ekaterina (Katya) Paderina, who grew up in Yekaterinburg, east of the Ural Mountains. In interviews, Banks has recalled meeting Paderina in 2000, at a Britney Spears concert. The marriage was also Katya Banks’s second. In 1998, when she was twenty-five, she married a retired merchant seaman, Eric Butler. Recently, I visited Butler at his apartment in Portsmouth, a port city in southern England, and the site of a British Navy base. (According to a [BBC investigation](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fnews\u002Fuk-46460194), an offshore company linked to Banks, Ural Properties, owns an apartment close to the naval base; Banks denies having any connection to Ural.) Now seventy-five, Butler speaks with a stutter, which was caused by a stroke, but he easily recalled dates, times, and events.\n\nHe told me that, in the summer of 1998, he met Paderina on Portsmouth’s waterfront, where she was sunbathing topless. He was fifty-four and divorced. When he asked her what she did before coming to Portsmouth, she said that she’d been living in Dubai, but had been “treated as a common prostitute” and deported. Official records in the Emirates confirm that she was deported. (Paderina, through Wigmore, declined to speak to *The New Yorker.* Banks would not comment on his wife’s activities in Dubai.)\n\nButler and Paderina began a relationship. Butler wasn’t wealthy, he says, but he owned a “nice house,” and he promised to help Paderina pay for college. When she suggested that they get married, he asked if she was looking for love or for a passport. “Love,” she said.\n\nThey were married within a few months. Butler recalls that, shortly after the ceremony, Paderina said, “&nbsp;‘I do not love you. I am not married to you in Russia. And, if you ever disobey me, you will feel the full force of my father’s connections.’&nbsp;” (She does not remember saying this.)\n\nWhen Paderina’s parents flew in from Yekaterinburg for a visit, her father, Evgeny, told Butler that he worked in the “government property business.” According to Butler, he also boasted “about his connections with the Russian Mafia.” Paderina’s mother, Olga, worked at a language school, and her expertise seems to have benefitted Katya, who speaks six languages.\n\nButler said that Paderina often stayed out most of the night, without explanation. One day, he was surprised by a visit from police officers at the Special Branch, which is concerned with national security and intelligence. They questioned him about his wife’s daily activities and promised to return again. Later, Butler told me, the officers informed him that Paderina was depositing significant sums of money in private bank accounts. In 1999, he filed for divorce. Paderina attacked him with a lamp and was charged with assault. (Banks later told the *Sunday Times* that Paderina had acted in “self-defence.”)\n\nIn the time that he and Paderina were together, she became pregnant with their son, Darren, who is now eighteen, and who has been brought up by Katya and Arron Banks. Butler told me that he felt pressure from Darren not to disparage Katya, but that he also felt an imperative to tell the truth.\n\nWhile Paderina’s marriage to Butler was ending, she learned that she was in danger of being deported from the U.K. She asked the local M.P., Mike Hancock, for help. They began spending time together; Butler accused them of having an affair. (They denied it.) Hancock, who is now in his seventies, has notably pro-Russian views. Indeed, in 2010 Hancock’s colleagues in a parliamentary group on Russian affairs became so disconcerted by his “pro-Putin and pro-Medvedev” agenda that they ousted him from a leadership role. Later that year, British security officials attempted to deport his parliamentary assistant, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, a young Russian with whom he had a four-year affair, because they suspected her of being a member of the S.V.R., Russia’s foreign-intelligence service. Zatuliveter had been observed with an S.V.R. officer in London; she also had relationships with a German *nato*{: .small} official and a Dutch diplomat.\n\nZatuliveter fought to stay in Britain. A special immigration panel concluded that, “on the balance of probabilities,” she was not a Russian agent.\n\nBanks told me that insinuations that his wife, who helps to manage their family properties, had any connection with Russian espionage were preposterous. Katya, he said, was not even interested in politics. The license plate of her car—X MI5 SPY—is a knowing wink at her detractors. Banks did not comment on Katya’s relationship with Hancock, except to note that her interaction with him was routine: “She had overstayed her student visa, and so she wrote to her local M.P.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5c8c1973ba537d02a3b6fb9c]\n\n+++\n\nWigmore told me it was “laughable” to suggest that Paderina or her family had Mafia or intelligence connections, arguing, “They would have been either very rich or very powerful—they were neither.” At the club, he observed, “If you’re *really* a spy, you don’t put ‘X MI5 SPY’ on the back of your car.”\n\nRecently, I spoke to Boris Volodarsky, who was a former undercover operative for the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency. He is now an academic authority on Russian espionage. In his opinion, Russian intelligence services—most likely the S.V.R.—“were in this or that way involved in the life and further career development” of Paderina and Zatuliveter. He told me that their activities reminded him of “swallows”—young Soviet women who sought to influence “important and promising foreign targets.” When I noted that Zatuliveter had officially been cleared of espionage, he told me that the judgment violated “all logic and common sense.” In 2011, he said, the British were naïve about the nature and scope of Russian intelligence in the Putin era. John Sipher, who retired, in 2014, from a twenty-eight-year career in the National Clandestine Service, which included a period in Moscow, told me that he also questioned the panel’s judgment, calling it “some of the worst analysis I’ve ever seen.”\n\nBanks has publicly acknowledged that his marriage to Katya has been fraught. In 2014, they consulted divorce lawyers, and Katya now lives with her mother, Olga. I asked him what it was like being married to a Russian, given Russia’s frosty relationship with Britain. “I’m not anti-Russian,” he told me. “I’m not particularly pro-Russian. I’m agnostic.”\n\nBut his public statements on Russian foreign policy have not been agnostic. He supported Putin’s 2014 military intervention in Crimea, saying that the invaded region was “as Russian as the Isle of Wight is British.” Leave.EU has also posted notably pro-Russian social-media content; it once hailed Putin for “wiping out *isis*{: .small} in Syria.” I asked Banks how he had felt when U.K. officials accused G.R.U. officers of poisoning Sergei Skripal, the Russian-British double agent, last year in Salisbury. He said, “My only reaction to the Skripal thing was that, having been involved in politics and seen the dirty tricks that go on, I’m naturally distrustful of *anything* I read in the media. Because there’s the usual agendas sitting behind that.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks recalls that, at a *ukip*{: .small} conference in September, 2015, he and Wigmore met a “shady character called Oleg,” who was introduced to them as “the First Secretary” at the Russian Embassy—“in other words, the KGB’s man in London.” “Oleg” is Alexander Udod, an S.V.R. officer who was ejected from Britain after the Skripal poisoning. Volodarksy, the former G.R.U. officer, suggested to me that Udod was also the S.V.R. agent who had met with Ekaterina Zatuliveter in London. (In Zatuliveter’s immigration hearing, she referred to the agent by one initial: “U.”)\n\nBanks writes in his book that Udod invited him and Wigmore to lunch with the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, on November 6, 2015. They readily accepted. “You get invited by the Ambassador, of course you go\\!” Banks told me. “Maybe it was a mistake.”\n\n“They weren’t perceived as bad back then,” Wigmore added. At the time, he said, British politicians were “actively trying to get people to invest in Russia.”\n\nWigmore later texted me to say that “The Bad Boys of Brexit” contained an error: he, not Udod, had suggested the embassy lunch. Another member of Banks’s circle, however, told me that the meeting was indeed arranged by Udod.\n\nIn any case, the embassy meeting was a riotous success. In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks writes that he “hit it off from the word go” with the Russian delegation. Scheduled to last an hour, the meeting became a six-hour “boozy lunch,” and ended with Ambassador Yakovenko offering vodka from a bottle that had supposedly been made for Stalin.\n\nNo other meetings with Russian diplomats or businessmen are described in “The Bad Boys of Brexit.” For more than a year, the public had the impression that this single lunch engagement was Banks’s only meeting with Ambassador Yakovenko. This wasn’t true. Banks told me that during the “boozy lunch” he mentioned owning diamond interests in southern Africa. Ambassador Yakovenko invited Banks to another meeting, later that November, at which a Russian businessman named Siman Povarenkin offered Banks a chance to invest in the consolidation of six gold mines in Russia—a multibillion-dollar deal. After that meeting, Banks wrote an e-mail to Povarenkin in which he said, “I am very bullish on gold so keen to have a look.” Banks relayed Povarenkin’s pitch to several associates, including Jim Mellon, the Leave.EU “ambassador.”\n\nBanks told me that, after consulting with several experts, including an investment banker named Nick van den Brul, he turned down Povarenkin’s proposal. But, according to a recent report by Channel 4, Banks had been enthusiastic about the gold deal. At his behest, a detailed pitch document was written, in which Banks and his partners expressed interest in overseeing the project. A subsequent e-mail from one of the partners suggested that Banks and his investors travel to Moscow to meet bankers from Sberbank—a lender with close ties to the Kremlin—to discuss “financial muscle.”\n\nFour months before the referendum, van den Brul discussed with Banks the idea of investing in Alrosa, a diamond producer controlled by the Russian state, which was in the process of being partially privatized. In an e-mail, van den Brul said that doing so could “open up some opportunities.” Banks didn’t take up this offer, either. (A fund associated with Mellon did invest, but a representative said the fund’s specific investments were made without his knowledge.)\n\nTwo months before the referendum, a third opportunity to work with Russians was presented to Banks: a gold-mining project in Guinea, in West Africa, owned by Ilya Karas, a London-based Russian businessman with a Belizean passport. Karas had overseen an unsuccessful oil-infrastructure project in Russia, and he’d owned a bank in Djibouti.\n\nWigmore recently told me that Banks and Karas never met, saying, “When we checked it out, we decided not to proceed further.” Karas, however, told me that he met Banks in May, 2016, in Bristol. In the end, he said, Banks decided not to invest in the Guinean project.\n\n“The whole point is that as a businessman you entertain and look at everything,” Banks told me. “You shouldn’t be judged on what you *don’t* do.” This is reasonable enough. Yet it is curious that at least three opportunities with Russians were dangled in front of him in the months before the referendum. The Labour M.P. Ben Bradshaw asked Parliament “why the Kremlin would offer Mr. Banks sweetheart deals.”\n\nBanks told me that ambassadors often help arrange business deals between their home and host countries. Wigmore has said that, while serving as a trade envoy for Belize, he took part in many similar business discussions, and not just with Russians. But Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a career C.I.A. officer and a Russia expert who is now at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told me that Ambassador Yakovenko’s involvement in such meetings with Banks was suspicious. Mowatt-Larssen discounted the idea that an ambassador in a key post like London would set up business deals without the Kremlin’s awareness. He said that Russian ambassadors do exactly what “Putin or his closest advisers have asked them to do,” adding, “They are not foreign-ministry representatives as much as they are Putin’s representatives.”\n\nBanks has said that he has never sought out investment in Russia, and that it is “absolute garbage” to suggest that he has taken money from Russians, or that Russian money had been funnelled into Brexit, or that he’d been influenced by Russian officials. If his encounters with Russians in 2015 and 2016 were actually part of an attempted influence campaign, he was at a loss to explain Putin’s motives. “I wonder what the Russians wanted from me?” he [asked](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F06\u002F29\u002Fworld\u002Feurope\u002Frussia-britain-brexit-arron-banks.html) a reporter from the New York *Times*.\n\nGiven that Banks had become an ardent Brexit supporter by 2014, it seems unfair to suggest that Russian activities in 2015 and 2016 reframed his views. Yet Banks may not have given a full accounting of his interactions with Russians.\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn 2013 and 2014, Banks bought major stakes in four diamond mines in South Africa and a license for exploration in Lesotho. The South African mines were small and largely exhausted. Two of the mines required millions of dollars of investment simply to resume operations. One is still dormant.\n\nBanks told me that the mines had been bought cheaply. I asked several industry experts about Banks’s claim, in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” that the mines were so profitable that they helped prompt his sizable donation to *ukip*{: .small} in 2014. The experts told me that there’s scant chance of his having accrued any legitimate profits from the mines by the time he made his million-pound pledge.\n\nSo far, the most notable thing that the mines have produced is a vicious commercial dispute between Banks and his former partner in the mines, Chris Kimber. They have been making claims and counterclaims in a South African court. In a sworn statement, Kimber has claimed that Banks attempted to raise money from Russians, and that Banks put “enormous pressure” on him to obtain diamonds that would impress potential investors, even before the mines were fully operational. Kimber claims that Banks and his partners asked him to “find diamonds from third parties.” Banks denies all this, and alleges that Kimber defrauded him of his fair share of the diamonds produced by the mine.\n\nNo proof has emerged that Banks committed crimes in South Africa. But Brad Brooks-Rubin, a former State Department official who helps run the Sentry, a nonprofit group that monitors corruption in conflict zones, said that the diamond-mining industry “is almost *designed* to allow laundering.” Oversight was minimal, and mines were often sold through a “sight” system, without a proper audit of what each mine produced.\n\nRecently, I spoke to someone with intimate knowledge of the business relationship between Banks and Kimber, who told me that, well before Banks met Ambassador Yakovenko, Banks sought Russian investment in his South African mines. (Wigmore says that Banks approached potential investors from various nations.) Banks, the source said, also attempted to invest in gold mines in Russia, and had travelled to Moscow to discuss potential deals.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5c8c1973d87bdc5978194c19]\n\n+++\n\nAccording to the source, Banks had also attempted to hire Bourevestnik, a diamond-screening company that is a subsidiary of Alrosa, the Russian firm. Banks told me, categorically, that this wasn’t true, but a former colleague of his said that he had seen Bourevestnik machines being used at Banks’s mines.\n\n“There was no Alrosa\\!” Banks told me.\n\nKimber, in his sworn statement, writes that, in 2015, “Banks was in discussions with Alrosa and had made certain promises to them.” (Alrosa denies this.) Earlier this year, Banks’s fixer in South Africa, James Pryor, told a BBC reporter that Banks had sought Russian investment. Later, Pryor denied having said this, even though the interview was recorded.\n\nDuring this period, Banks cultivated influential politicians in Lesotho, including the Prime Minister, Tom Thabane. Reporting by Channel 4 suggests that they helped Banks acquire mining licenses there. Banks has admitted to the BBC that he placed money in the private account of one of the politicians, but he denies that it was a bribe; he was merely making a political donation.\n\nThabane recently told the BBC that in August, 2014, when unrest forced him and another politician into exile in South Africa, Banks paid for their food and their lodgings. The Kimber affidavit also suggests that Banks was prepared to arrange “mercenary support” for allies in Lesotho, and had even collected guns for this purpose. The former colleague dismissed this as “bonfire talk,” and Banks strongly denied Kimber’s allegations. He told me that if any associates of his had collected weapons it was simply to protect his mining properties. “If you own a diamond mine, guess what?” he said. “People are going to raid it.”\n\nBanks told me that Kimber was not to be trusted, because he was his opponent in a legal “scrap.” He also claimed that Kimber was himself under investigation in South Africa. A recent Channel 4 report maintains that, in 2017, an associate of Banks’s offered inducements to a Hawks officer in return for his opening an investigation into Kimber. (Wigmore acknowledged that Banks had asked the Hawks to investigate Kimber, but denied any impropriety.) The Hawks recently told me that they are not currently investigating either Kimber or Banks, having decided that, at least for now, the dispute between the men is a “civil matter.”\n\n“It’s not that I don’t understand why journalists love this shit,” Banks said of his mines, batting away further questions. “Gold, diamonds, Trump, Russia—I mean, what’s *not* to like?”\n\n-=-=-=-\nAfter Banks ordered another glass of white wine at the Mayfair club, he told me that he was fascinated by journalists. As a tribe, he said, they were often “so clever that they’re stupid”: reporters became so obsessed with fleshing out narratives aligned with their political sensibility that they couldn’t see an uncomplicated truth in front of their nose. Banks told me a story about visiting Mississippi, in August, 2016, with Farage, who spoke at one of Trump’s campaign rallies. Trump introduced him as “the man behind Brexit.”\n\n“You could palpably feel the atmosphere,” Banks recalled. Despite polls to the contrary, he felt certain that Trump was going to win. It had been the same with Brexit, Banks said: “The journalists were, like, ‘This isn’t happening—we don’t want it to happen, therefore it *won’t* happen.’&nbsp;”\n\nBanks suggested that the media’s inquiries into the source of his Leave donations, and into his connections with Russia, were desperate attempts to prove that the two great populist votes of 2016 had been illegitimate. Remainer journalists saw conspiracies where there were none.\n\nThis was its own conspiracy theory, of course. The truth is likely to be more complicated. Banks may not be a Russian asset, but the Russians have clearly courted him for years. Banks, meanwhile, has insistently misled British reporters and investigators about the nature of his relationship with the Russians, to the point that it seems fair to wonder if yet more connections will emerge. And one thing is clear: although Russia does not seem to have achieved anything like the success it did by stealing Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, it certainly attempted to interfere in British affairs.\n\nIn the view of some seasoned observers of Putin’s disinformation campaigns, the Russians may be pleased to have had their discussions with Banks exposed: the revelations have compromised him in the eyes of many Britons, sowing greater division in the U.K. Peter Pomerantsev, the author of “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,” a book about Russian propaganda, has no specific knowledge about the Banks case, but he told me that such techniques have been used since Soviet times. “There is a great word to describe it, *zapachkat*—it means to ‘besmirch,’ or ‘make someone dirty,’&nbsp;” Pomerantsev said. “Getting caught seems like half the trick.”\n\nOne journalist who brought Banks’s meetings with Russians to light is Carole Cadwalladr, of the *Observer*, whose reporting has led to numerous Brexit-related scoops. Banks spoke briefly, and snidely, to me about her work; without citing examples, he said that it was riddled with errors, in part because she saw deep ties where there were only glancing connections. He depicted Cadwalladr as a lonely woman staring at a corkboard on which pinned names were connected with string in a complicated pattern of zigzags, as in a detective show.\n\nBanks then talked about his relationship with Steve Bannon. According to some reports, they are co-conspirators: right-wing vandals who have caused mayhem in Britain and America on behalf of shadowy paymasters, and who are themselves connected, through Cambridge Analytica. In a leaked 2015 e-mail between Bannon and Banks, the two discussed whether it might be possible to raise funds for the Brexit project in the U.S. before the official Brexit campaign began. (If foreign funds had been raised *during* the campaign, this would have been illegal.) Banks, however, insisted that his discussions with Bannon were insignificant, and that they hardly meant that he and Bannon were friends.\n\n“We *dislike* him\\!” Wigmore added.\n\nWhen Banks, Wigmore, Farage, and others from the Brexit campaign made their November, 2016, visit to Trump Tower, Bannon was present. Banks told me that, before his party went up to see Trump, Bannon attempted to extract from him a forty-thousand-pound payment. Ostensibly, this request was related to work done by Cambridge Analytica for Leave.EU, but, given the context, it seems almost as if Bannon were charging an admission fee to see the President-elect. (A source close to Bannon called this idea “preposterous.”) Banks told me that he refused, saying that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t performed any services for Leave.EU. This riled Bannon, but Farage placated him, and the Brexit entourage met with Trump, in his apartment, without money changing hands. Trump, Banks told me, was “thoughtful, pleasant, almost polite, and funny.”\n\nI asked Banks what kind of Cambridge Analytica services Bannon had offered in 2015. At the time, the company was touting itself as an expert in microtargeting voters, with access to millions of people’s “psychographic” information. This cache of data was later found to have been improperly culled from Facebook.\n\n“They put an offer to me that was sort of contemptible,” Banks said. He was asked to give “a million, up front,” for voter-targeting suggestions, which would be based on an algorithm derived from the Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica promised that the results would help Leave.EU “raise six or seven million pounds for the campaign.” Banks looked at me and said, “We turned it down.”\n\nWhy? Banks laughed, and the half smile broke into a full one. “Because it was illegal,” he said.&nbsp;♦\n\n","articleSection":"letter from london","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ed Caesar","sameAs":"https:\u002F\u002Fthe-new-yorker.com\u002Fcontributor\u002Fed-caesar\u002F"}],"dateModified":"2019-06-25T16:32:21.061","datePublished":"2019-03-18T05:00:00.000","headline":"The Chaotic Triumph of Arron Banks, the “Bad Boy of Brexit”","image":["https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F2:1\u002Fw_1843,h_921,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F2:2\u002Fw_445,h_445,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F16:9\u002Fw_1839,h_1034,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F4:3\u002Fw_1844,h_1383,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1843,h_1843,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg"],"keywords":["letter from london","apple news opt in","apple news paid","apple news preview"],"thumbnailUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c8c17380c54352cc28c0a58\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1843,h_1843,c_limit\u002F190325_r33938.jpg","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2019\u002F03\u002F25\u002Fthe-chaotic-triumph-of-arron-banks-the-bad-boy-of-brexit","isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"The New Yorker"},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"hasPart":[{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":"False","cssSelector":".paywall"}],"alternativeHeadline":"The U.K. is in a panic over voters’ decision to withdraw from the E.U.

He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next."],["p","Banks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such “lies.” A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity.

The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain’s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn’t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as “no deal,” would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine."],["p","This outcome was Banks’s preferred result. “No deal means we ",["em","leave"],",” he told me at the club."],["p","Banks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency—Britain’s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners’ money in electoral campaigns. “A number of criminal offences may have been committed,” the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks’s and Bilney’s stories had “changed over time,” and that what they told the commission was “not consistent” with company records. (Bilney says that this “evolvement of response” can be ascribed to the commission’s failure to understand “our business structures.”)"],["p","A sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency’s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote.

Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin’s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea."],["p","According to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a “regime-change agenda” around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin’s regime might be targeted next. “Russia felt they needed to push back hard,” Weiss told me. “They wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that’s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and—I think—their support of Brexit fits in.”"],["p","Banks’s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent “ambassador” for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a “friend and business partner,” made much of his money by investing in Russia.

Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency’s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks’s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, “There are still so many questions unanswered about Banks—where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.”"],["inline-embed",{"props":{"childTypes":["cartoon"],"name":"inset-left"},"ref":"","type":"callout:inset-left"},["inline-embed",{"props":{"image":{"id":"5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07","altText":"A woman wakes up her husband so he can check to go see if there is a burglar.","contentType":"cartoon","sources":{"sm":{"width":640,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoons\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07\u002Fmaster\u002Fw_640,c_limit\u002F190325_a22676.jpg","height":486},"md":{"width":768,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoons\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07\u002Fmaster\u002Fw_768,c_limit\u002F190325_a22676.jpg","height":583},"lg":{"width":1024,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoons\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07\u002Fmaster\u002Fw_1024,c_limit\u002F190325_a22676.jpg","height":777},"xl":{"width":1280,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoons\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07\u002Fmaster\u002Fw_1280,c_limit\u002F190325_a22676.jpg","height":972},"xxl":{"width":1600,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoons\u002F5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07\u002Fmaster\u002Fw_1600,c_limit\u002F190325_a22676.jpg","height":1214}},"dangerousCaption":"“I’d go see if it’s a burglar myself, but you know how I don’t like confrontation.”","dangerousCredit":"","links":[{"network":"facebook","behavior":"popup","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fdialog\u002Ffeed?&display=popup&caption=&app_id=1147169538698836&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22676%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Donsite-share%26utm_brand%3Dthe-new-yorker%26utm_social-type%3Dearned","label":"Share on Facebook"},{"network":"twitter","url":"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fintent\u002Ftweet\u002F?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22676%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Donsite-share%26utm_brand%3Dthe-new-yorker%26utm_social-type%3Dearned&text=&via=NewYorker","label":"Share on Twitter"},{"network":"email","url":"mailto:?subject=&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22676%3Futm_source%3Donsite-share%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Donsite-share%26utm_brand%3Dthe-new-yorker","label":"Share via Email"},{"network":"store","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fcondenaststore.com\u002Fconde-nast-brand\u002Fcartoons","label":"Get in store"},{"network":"canonical","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fcartoon\u002Fa22676","label":"A New Yorker Cartoon"}]}},"ref":"5c8c1973ef56b82d12330e07","type":"cartoon"}]],["p","The government of the U.K. has been strikingly muted in its response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats.

Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports—including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people’s choice and must be enforced.

Damian Collins has demanded a broader inquiry into Russian interference in British affairs. In an interview at his office in the Houses of Parliament, he told me that he had serious concerns about the source of Banks’s funds. “The reason the questions persist is that he seems to own a number of businesses that don’t make any money,” Collins said. “There’s never really been a clear explanation from him about the funding of these campaigns.”"],["p","Banks recently sent Collins’s constituents a letter calling him a “disgrace” and a “snake in the grass.” In an op-ed, Collins responded that he would not be cowed by Banks’s “bullyboy tactics.”"],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"Banks’s affairs have also fallen under scrutiny outside the U.K. Banks, Wigmore, and Farage came to public attention in the U.S. shortly after the 2016 elections, when they were photographed with President-elect ",["a",{"href":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump","isExternal":false},"Donald Trump"]," outside his apartment in Trump Tower.

In “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” Banks flatly states that Leave.EU had “hired Cambridge Analytica.” He later insisted that his group had held only “preliminary discussions” with the firm, and never paid it anything; he repeated this claim to me. But the leaked e-mails show that discussions extended into 2016—beyond what Banks had previously admitted. Bannon is copied on some of these e-mails; in one of them, Banks writes that he “would like to get CA on the team, maybe look at the first cut of the data.” When news of the e-mails broke, Collins called them evidence of “direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump,” and redoubled his campaign to establish a broad-ranging inquiry."],["p",["a",{"href":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fadam-schiff","isExternal":false},"Adam Schiff"],", the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that there were “parallels and interconnections in abundance” between the apparent Russian efforts to influence Brexit and the well-documented, and possibly decisive, Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election. He described Putin’s ambassadors in D.C. and in London as conduits of “malign influence.” According to an American lawyer with knowledge of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Banks and Farage have become persons of interest in that inquiry. (This is “bollocks,” Wigmore said.)"],["p","In December, two South African intelligence officials confirmed to me that Banks, who owns an array of businesses in southern Africa, including several diamond mines, had been the subject of two investigations by the Hawks, South Africa’s version of the F.B.I. The first case involved looking into whether Banks used his diamond mines in South Africa to launder stones from other parts of Africa—a process known as “salting the mines.” The second explored whether Banks, or people close to him, acquired automatic weapons without a license during a period of political upheaval in Lesotho; this investigation was opened by a branch of the Hawks known as Crimes Against the State."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"Considering all these investigations, Banks and Wigmore were in oddly high spirits when we met. Banks drank white wine; Wigmore, gin-and-tonic. They frequently reduced each other to gales of laughter with a joke or a reminiscence, and they found it both surreal and amusing to be figures of suspicion on three continents. A few days before the meeting, Wigmore sent me a text about the lives that he and Banks had been leading since the Brexit vote: “It’s a film a book and a thriller rolled into one lol.” He appended to the message the crying-laughing-face emoji."],["p","Banks dismissed much of the reporting about him as overheated Remainer fantasy—the product of journalists and media proprietors who had been “driven crazy by Brexit.” This argument echoes Trump’s claim that Americans who express concerns about his campaign’s communications with Russian officials are just displacing their rage over his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Banks said that he’d given money to a campaign in an entirely legal way, and now he was being punished for having been effective. All the criminal investigations were similarly motivated by politics. One could not trust the Electoral Commission to act fairly when it referred him to the National Crime Agency, he said, because the commission was filled with Remain supporters. Brexit itself was at risk, Banks warned me, because most M.P.s were Remainers, as were many powerful people outside Parliament."],["p","For all his bonhomie, there was a sinister aspect to Banks’s embattled outlook. Leave.EU’s social-media feed, which is overseen by Banks, often parroted the alt-right view that liberal global élites exert an outsized sway over politics and the media.

The site is partly funded by Soros. In October, three days after a pipe bomb was discovered at Soros’s house in Connecticut, Banks tweeted, “I suppose there are good Jews and bad Jews, then George Soros.”"],["p","In our conversations, it was obvious that Banks read widely—including publications that he professes to hate, such as the liberal ",["em","Financial Times"],"—and that he was capable of nuanced political thought. For instance, he was able to disentangle his support of British unionism—the idea that England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should not break apart—from his opposition to the E.U., an argument that some right-wing M.P.s might have struggled with. At other times, he came across as willfully obtuse, the product of an alt-right echo chamber. He used Trumpian language about the nefarious motives of the “deep state.” In Banks’s mind, there was no doubt that important news reached the public only at times most conducive to the interests of powerful but unseen forces.

But Banks told me that although his father worked in the sugar trade abroad, mostly in southern and eastern Africa, he had remained behind in England, where his mother lived, and that until the age of eleven or twelve he had attended a “local school.”"],["p","What is beyond doubt is that, at around the age of twelve, Banks was sent to a tumbledown boarding school in Berkshire, England, called Crookham Court. At the end of each term, he told me, he was flown to wherever his father was then working—South Africa, Swaziland, Somalia—as if he were an “Army brat.” This peripatetic childhood seems to have informed his later politics. Banks shares with some other Brexiteers an imperial nostalgia. He has spoken publicly about his love of the Commonwealth—the group of nations that are mostly former colonies of the British Empire—and of feeling more at home with Anglo-Saxon “kith and kin,” such as white Australians and South Africans, than with other kinds of foreigners. During our interview, I noticed that Banks pronounces “Kenya” with a long “e”—a pronunciation, still used by some white Kenyans, that was customary before Kenya gained its independence, in 1963. Banks denies being racist but admits to being “tribal.”"],["p","In 1989, some years after Banks left Crookham Court, a BBC documentary exposed the owner of the school, Philip Cadman, as a pedophile, and the school shut down. Several other former teachers have since been imprisoned for abusing boys. But Banks told me that he had “no issues” at the school and had a “lovely time.” In 2013, he posted angry messages on a Facebook page for former pupils, decrying the “victim culture” of the people sharing their stories, and accusing one student of “crying over spilt milk.” In the same exchange, he said, “I abhor homosexuality and abuse of any kind,” before clarifying his position: “Re homosexuality—I’m just old fashioned and don’t like it sorry.” Banks says that he acted as a character witness for Cadman at Cadman’s trial, in 1990. When I suggested that this was an odd thing for him to do, Banks said, “It shows my independent streak. He was a decorated war hero. I was asked to say what did I think.

In 1985, a white policeman had been killed during a race riot in the Tottenham area of London. Banks printed inflammatory flyers reminding voters that the Labour M.P. for Tottenham, Bernie Grant, had allegedly said that the police had received “a good hiding” in the riots. (Grant, who is of Guyanese origin, claimed to have been misquoted.) Banks distributed the leaflets in Basingstoke neighborhoods where many police officers lived.

These “Euroskeptic” Conservatives, they felt, wanted to freeze Farage out of the discussion, convinced that his rhetoric would antagonize swing voters. According to Shipman’s “All Out War,” in the summer of 2015 Banks gave Farage “a voice” by funding an alternative Leave movement, which became known as Leave.EU. Among other things, Banks and Farage hoped to pressure the establishment campaign for Leave into intensifying its rhetoric."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","Britain is now so polarized by Brexit that it’s hard to credit that there were once good-faith arguments on both sides of the debate. Remain proponents are caricatured as cosmopolitan élites who are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary voters. The Leave side is often portrayed as a quasi-racist movement whose sole aim is to foment hostility toward foreigners. But even if, as many experts suspect, implementing Brexit proves harmful, many proponents of Leave had legitimate complaints about the E.U., which they believed to be a sclerotic and overweening supranational body."],["p","However, even when there was an intellectual argument for Leave, there was sometimes an ugly subtext. I spent the evening of the referendum vote reporting from a pub in a poor post-industrial town in Yorkshire, in the North of England. White Leave-voting patrons complained to me that Muslims had changed their community, and that they wanted to “get my country back.” They understood that leaving the E.U. would not solve the perceived problem—the Pakistanis and Indians in their town were second- or third-generation immigrants—but they saw the referendum vote as a way to register a festering grievance."],["p","Subsequent research has reinforced this kind of anecdotal evidence. In 2016, social psychologists from Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted a study of referendum voters, and found that support for Brexit correlated with “collective narcissism”—a belief in the unparalleled greatness of one’s country—and with a heightened fear of immigrants.

But it was also a campaign that blew dog whistles.

It had more edge. Not everything they did was everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, that’s life. It was a much more populist campaign.” In March, 2016, Leave.EU launched a “Back Off, Barack!” petition, asking President Obama to “butt out” of the Brexit debate. The following month, a Facebook post featured a thuggish group portrait of E.U. supporters, such as Angela Merkel and Tony Blair, calling them “The Hateful Eight.”"],["p","Banks, through his insurance businesses, had call centers at his disposal, and in “The Bad Boys of Brexit” he wrote that he planned to deploy these resources on behalf of Leave.EU. Something close to that appears to have happened. In February, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, which is owned by Banks, were collectively fined a hundred and twenty thousand pounds by the U.K. Information Commissioner, a regulator who monitors breaches of data privacy, because Leave.EU had sent hundreds of thousands of political advertisements to Eldon customers. Banks had appeared before Parliament and denied that Eldon employees had worked simultaneously on the political campaign—but, months later, he was countered by whistle-blowers. One former employee told the ",["em","Observer"],", “I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t want to work on the political stuff. I wasn’t comfortable with it.

He described Douglas Carswell, a Euroskeptic M.P. and a key figure within Vote Leave, as “borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in.” Leaders of Vote Leave, in turn, described Banks as “impossible.” Attempts to bring the two anti-E.U. groups together failed.

He told me, “We played the media like a Stradivarius,” noting that “if we spent eight million in the referendum, we got thirty-five, forty million in free publicity” by outraging liberal commentators. This tactic had an obvious model across the Atlantic. “We are going to be blunt, edgy, and controversial, Donald Trump-style,” Banks wrote in “The Bad Boys of Brexit,” adding, “If BBC Producers aren’t spluttering organic muesli over their breakfast tables every morning, we won’t be doing our job.”"],["p","With days to go before the referendum, Farage unveiled a new ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ukip"]," poster.

Liz Bilney, Leave.EU’s C.E.O., agreed, noting that, with active campaigning halted, the video “could get a lot of take up.” Banks replied, “Exactly—press it harder.”"],["p","After the referendum, Leave’s competing factions scrambled to claim credit for the victory. Dominic Cummings, the key strategist in Vote Leave, believed that Farage and Leave.EU had been a “net drag” on the campaign. Banks told me that the social-media postings of Leave.EU reached working-class voters, particularly in the North of England, who would not otherwise have voted.

Later that year, British security officials attempted to deport his parliamentary assistant, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, a young Russian with whom he had a four-year affair, because they suspected her of being a member of the S.V.R., Russia’s foreign-intelligence service.

Ambassador Yakovenko invited Banks to another meeting, later that November, at which a Russian businessman named Siman Povarenkin offered Banks a chance to invest in the consolidation of six gold mines in Russia—a multibillion-dollar deal. After that meeting, Banks wrote an e-mail to Povarenkin in which he said, “I am very bullish on gold so keen to have a look.” Banks relayed Povarenkin’s pitch to several associates, including Jim Mellon, the Leave.EU “ambassador.”"],["p","Banks told me that, after consulting with several experts, including an investment banker named Nick van den Brul, he turned down Povarenkin’s proposal. But, according to a recent report by Channel 4, Banks had been enthusiastic about the gold deal.

A subsequent e-mail from one of the partners suggested that Banks and his investors travel to Moscow to meet bankers from Sberbank—a lender with close ties to the Kremlin—to discuss “financial muscle.”"],["p","Four months before the referendum, van den Brul discussed with Banks the idea of investing in Alrosa, a diamond producer controlled by the Russian state, which was in the process of being partially privatized.

Now there is new evidence that it did. Newly surfaced e-mails show that the former Trump adviser [Steve Bannon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fsteve-bannon), and [Cambridge Analytica](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fcambridge-analytica), the Big Data company that he worked for at the time, were simultaneously incubating both nationalist political movements in 2015.\n\nEmma Briant, an academic expert on disinformation at George Washington University, has unearthed new e-mails that appear to reveal the earliest documented role played by Bannon in Brexit. The e-mails, which date back to October of 2015, show that Bannon, who was then the vice-president of Cambridge Analytica, an American firm largely owned by the U.S. hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, was in the loop on discussions taking place at the time between his company and the leaders of Leave.EU, a far-right nationalist organization. The following month, Leave.EU publicly launched a campaign aimed at convincing British voters to support a referendum in favor of exiting the European Union. The U.K. narrowly voted for the so-called Brexit in June, 2016. The tumultuous fallout has roiled the U.K. ever since, threatening the government of the Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May.\n\nBannon did not respond to requests for comment. But his name and private e-mail address appear on the chain of three e-mails in October, 2015, between Brittany Kaiser, the director of program development at Cambridge Analytica, and Arron Banks, who headed the Leave.EU campaign and referred to himself in the title of his memoir as one of “[The Bad Boys of Brexit](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FBad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum\u002Fdp\u002F1785901826).” Banks could not be reached for comment regarding the e-mails, which were first published Saturday by the British Web site [openDemocracy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.opendemocracy.net\u002Fuk\u002Fbrexitinc\u002Fpeter-geoghegan\u002Fbrexit-bankroller-arron-banks-cambridge-analytica-and-steve-bannon-expl).\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F5b4ce61f4ab0c926d05b4113]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe precise role played by foreign entities in promoting and possibly funding Brexit has been clouded in mystery and controversy. British law forbids foreign contributions to its political campaigns—just as U.S. law bars foreign campaign contributions. The laws are designed to prevent international manipulation of domestic affairs. Executives working for Cambridge Analytica, which filed for bankruptcy this spring, have categorically denied that the firm was paid to do any work for the Leave.EU campaign. The new e-mails do not contradict that, but show that, even if the firm was not paid for its services, it laid some of the early groundwork for the Leave.EU campaign. The e-mails show that Banks and others in the Leave.EU leadership met with Cambridge Analytica executives in 2015, and discussed what Banks called a “two-stage process” that would “get CA”—Cambridge Analytica—“on the team.”\n\nIn an e-mail dated October 24, 2015, Banks also discussed tasking Cambridge Analytica with helping him raise funds through the U.S. for the Leave.EU campaign. In a note to the Cambridge Analytica executives with whom he had met, Banks wrote, “It’s clear that major donors are sitting on the fence, but we aim to do something about that.” Banks returns to the topic later in the note, adding, “We would like CA to come up with a strategy for fund raising in the states and engaging companies and special interest groups that might be affected by TTIP”—the pending Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. \n\nBanks did not address the potential illegality of direct foreign donations, but suggested a strategy that might circumvent the letter of the campaign-finance laws, if not their intent. Banks suggested enlisting Cambridge Analytica’s help in reaching out to Americans “with family ties to the UK.” Evidently, by targeting Americans with British relatives, the hope was that they could avoid campaign-finance-law violations. He suggested that Cambridge Analytica, which boasted of having access to two hundred and thirty million Americans’ voter-registration data, as well as other personal information, could be solicited “to raise money and create SM [social media] activity.”\n\nThe following day, a Cambridge Analytica staffer sent an e-mail back to Banks, again with Bannon included on the chain, suggesting that the firm was on board with the idea of developing a proposal that would include “US-based fundraising strategies.”\n\nWhether foreign funds secretly supported the Brexit movement has become the focus of intense speculation and investigation in the U.K. The British probes, in many respects, are parallel to the Robert Mueller investigation of possible Russian support for Trump’s 2016 campaign. Banks has drawn particular scrutiny because his business spent some nine million pounds supporting the Brexit campaign, making him the country’s single largest political-campaign donor by far, despite questions about whether he had the personal wealth to contribute that much on his own. Banks has insisted that his contributions were legal, and that foreign sources, including Russia, contributed no funds. But multiple British agencies have launched inquiries, including a criminal investigation into Banks’s role by the National Crime Agency, the U.K.’s equivalent to the F.B.I.\n\nBrittany Kaiser, the former executive at Cambridge Analytica whose name appears on the new e-mails, has since become something of a whistle-blower, exposing the company’s role in the Brexit campaign to the press. Reached through a spokeswoman, she declined to comment. \n\nWhile the e-mail chain includes Bannon, there is no evidence that he read or commented on the exchange between the Leave.EU leaders and the Cambridge Analytica executives. In the fall of 2015, Bannon was busy setting up a new office for Cambridge Analytica in Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., and pitching the firm’s services to Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. The firm initially worked for Ted Cruz’s Presidential campaign. But, when Trump won the Republican nomination, the Mercer family, which had financially supported Trump’s Presidential bid, insisted that Trump put Bannon in charge of the campaign and bring in Cambridge Analytica, in which the family was heavily invested, as well. \n\nExecutives at Cambridge Analytica claimed that they had access to unprecedented quantities of advanced “psychographic” data that enabled the Trump campaign to micro-target its pitch to  voters. But, this past May, the company filed for bankruptcy in the wake of allegations—denied by Cambridge Analytica executives—that it had improperly obtained millions of people’s personal data from Facebook, without the users’ permission, in violation of the company’s regulations.\n\nThe possibility that both Brexit and the Trump campaign simultaneously relied upon the same social-media company and its transgressive tactics, as well as some of the same advisers, to further far-right nationalist campaigns, set off alarm bells on both sides of the Atlantic. Damian Collins, a member of Parliament, and chair of its Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which held an inquiry into fake news, [told the *Observer*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fuk-news\u002F2018\u002Fnov\u002F17\u002Farron-banks-emails-steve-bannon-brexit-campaign-funds), which has broken much of the news about Cambridge Analytica in the U.K., that the new e-mails “suggest that the role of Bannon and Mercer is far deeper and more complex than we realised. There’s a big question about whether Mercer’s money was used in the Brexit campaign and it absolutely underscores why Britain needs a proper Mueller-style investigation. There are direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump. We’ve got to recognise the bigger picture here. This is being coordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we haven’t seen before.\"\n\nThe American investigations into foreign interference in Trump’s election, and British probes into Brexit, have increasingly become interwoven. The role of the Russian Ambassador to the U.K., Alexander Yakovenko, has reportedly been the subject of interest both to Mueller’s investigators and to those in the U.K., who have examined his relationship to Banks. The role of [Nigel Farage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fnigel-farage), the former leader of the far-right, Euroskeptic U.K. Independence Party, who has been an ally of Bannon and Trump, has also reportedly stirred the interest of investigators in both countries, especially after he was spotted in 2017 leaving the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, in which Julian Assange has taken refuge. Assange’s media platform, WikiLeaks, published many of the e-mails stolen by Russia from the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 election season.\n\nHow and whether all of these pieces fit together is the subject of Mueller’s investigation, but the lack of a similar single, overarching investigation in the U.K. has led critics to call for one. Emma Briant, for instance, who has submitted the new e-mails to the British government for further investigation, told openDemocracy that “this evidence shows that Banks was seeking foreign funding for Brexit from the very beginning.” She argued that the U.K. inquiry, like the U.S. one, needed to follow the money and the potential manipulation of public opinion as nationalist policies rose on both sides of the Atlantic.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Steve

O’Brien, a popular London talk-radio host, has been arguing that the “Leave” vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum was a tragic mistake. On Thursday morning, as the British Prime Minister, [Theresa May](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2018\u002F07\u002F30\u002Ftheresa-mays-impossible-choice), was preparing to defend in Parliament the controversial withdrawal deal her government has made with the European Union, O’Brien’s show received [a call](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lbc.co.uk\u002Fradio\u002Fpresenters\u002Fjames-obrien\u002Fleave-voter-cries-apologises-for-brexit\u002F) from a Leave voter named Bill,  who said he owed the host an apology. “I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong,” the man began to say, in an accent that placed him firmly outside the British élite. “I’m an old-fashioned git, really, I suppose&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;For some reason, I thought we were better off, but, clearly, I was wrong.” As Bill made this admission, his voice broke and he started crying. O’Brien pointed out that 17\\.4 million Britons made the same choice, and told him not to blame himself. Bill was inconsolable. “I was wrong, I am so sorry,” he blubbered. “What have I done to my country?”\n\nAt this stage, nobody knows for sure. As I write these words, there are rumors that the Parliamentary Conservative Party may hold [a vote of confidence](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fpolitics\u002F2018\u002Fnov\u002F16\u002Frebel-tory-mps-press-for-vote-of-no-confidence-in-theresa-may) later on Friday, which could conceivably force the Prime Minister to step down. If May survives and also wins a subsequent vote on her withdrawal deal, Britain will officially leave the E.U. in March. If Parliament rejects the agreement, May could try to negotiate another one or resign. If she resigns, there will probably be a general election, although it is also possible that [Jeremy Corbyn](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2016\u002F05\u002F23\u002Fthe-astonishing-rise-of-jeremy-corbyn), the Labour Party leader, could form a minority government and try his hand at haggling with Brussels. (Although many in the Labour Party are anti-Brexit, Corbyn has pledged to honor the result of the 2016 referendum.) If no agreement can be reached, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without any exit deal, a prospect that horrifies business leaders and investors but is looked upon with equanimity by some ardent Brexiteers.\n\nIt’s an almighty mess, and, as O’Brien pointed out to his distressed caller, it isn’t entirely the making of the ordinary Britons who voted Leave. For decades now, right-wing politicians and their allies on Fleet Street have been vilifying the E.U. and portraying its officials as meddling bureaucrats. During the referendum campaign, the Brexiteers misled the populace about how easy it would be to extract Britain from the union. They also lied about the economic benefits of leaving, claiming, for example, that it would generate billions of pounds a year to spend on the National Health Service.\n\nUnderlying this misinformation campaign was decades of social conditioning that warped the British psyche—and particularly the English psyche—into thinking that Britain was a place apart from, and superior to, the Continent. Growing up in England during the nineteen-seventies, I must have watched dozens of movies about plucky Britain’s heroic defeat of Hitler and the Germans in the Second World War, a narrative that downplayed the role of others on the allied side, including the United States. The French we learned to regard as unreliable garlic-gobblers. Italians were the butt of jokes—“What is the shortest book in the world? The Italian book of war heroes”—as were Spaniards. (“He’s from Barcelona” was a punch line in a popular television comedy.) As for the rest of the Continent, who needed it? Not us, the nation of Bobby Charlton, Churchill, Shakespeare, and King Arthur.\n\nThings are different today, especially among young and highly educated Britons. To them, the freedom of movement enshrined in the E.U. treaties is a potential life-changer—one that entitles them to live and work anywhere from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. To many Scots, membership of the E.U., along with looser ties to the U.K., offers a path to reasserting their national identity. British businesses, and foreign businesses with plants in the U.K., are also keenly aware of the advantages that membership of the E.U. affords them, including free movement of parts, final goods, labor, and capital. In a world of global supply chains and just-in-time manufacturing, the prospect of extensive customs checks being imposed between the U.K. and its neighbors was (and is) one that horrifies businesses.\n\nBut especially among older English people some of the jaundiced approach to Europe has survived, and it got amplified when hundreds of thousands of migrants from Eastern Europe moved to Britain in search of work after the expansion of the E.U. that took place in 2004\\. The doubters discovered a voice in the likes of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who claimed Britain would be better off without the E.U. In their saner moments, the Brexiteers acknowledged the importance of maintaining ready access to the vast European market. But they insisted that, with some dexterous negotiating, Britain would be able to guarantee this outcome and still reclaim full sovereignty from Brussels. In the [words of Johnson](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.politico.eu\u002Farticle\u002Fa-brief-history-of-having-cake-and-eating-it\u002F), it would be possible to have a cake and eat it, too.\n\nEarly on, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, [warned](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fpolitics\u002F2016\u002Foct\u002F13\u002Fits-hard-brexit-or-no-brexit-at-all-says-eu-council-president) that this was a fantasy. “Buy a cake, eat it, and see if it is still there on the plate,” he told the advocates of “cakeism.” Not without reason, Tusk and his colleagues feared that the real goal of the Brexiteers was to convert Britain into a deregulated, low-wage, low-tax competitor to the E.U. So the Europeans made it clear: if Britain wanted to retain full access to the E.U. market, it would have to continue to abide by the union’s standards on taxation, employment, competition, and the environment, as well as accepting some rulings from the European Court of Justice. (This is roughly the position held by Norway, which isn’t a member of the E.U. but engages in a great deal of commerce with the bloc.) Failure to accept these terms would relegate Britain to the status of Canada and other far-off trading partners.\n\nAfter shilly-shallying for almost two years after the referendum, May finally accepted this reality. In July, during a meeting at her official country house, Chequers, she warned her Cabinet that Britain would have to make major concession to reach a withdrawal agreement. Such a deal, which was known in the lingo as a “soft Brexit,” would still be worthwhile, May argued, because it would allow Britain to restrict the flow of European migrants, as well as enable it to stop paying into the E.U. budget and opt out of some E.U. policies, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy, which are widely regarded as being unfair to Britain.\n\nThe deal that British negotiators reached with the E.U. earlier this week is basically the one May outlined at Chequers. Even some pro-Europeans, including Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister, [described](https:\u002F\u002Fuk.news.yahoo.com\u002Ftony-blair-pms-brexit-deal-171048272.html) it as a capitulation, but that wasn’t entirely fair: May had very little bargaining leverage. She and the Europeans both knew that, even as Britain went through the motions of leaving the E.U., it couldn’t afford to make a clean break. Which, of course, raises the question of what the point of the exercise was to begin with.\n\nThe harsh fact is there was no point. Contrary to the claims of the Brexiteers, Britain already had substantial flexibility within the E.U. Having long ago opted out of the common currency and other E.U. initiatives, it retained the freedom to set its own interest rates and fiscal policies, check visitors at the border, and reject some of the legislative directives from Brussels, but it enjoyed all the advantages of the single market. To the extent that any E.U. member country was having its cake and eating it, Britain was the one. Now it has spent two and a half years trying to sabotage its future. As Bill and others are discovering, this can be a painful truth to contemplate.\n\n*A previous version of this article misstated the parameters of a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brexit","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a4a08312cd3aa6c53","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Theresa May","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"theresa-may"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jeremy Corbyn","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jeremy-corbyn"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a36cecf40192141ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Labour Party","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"labour-party"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92bfcc72cd92d0585","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Boris Johnson","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"boris-johnson"},{"id":"5c2e1cb941c92e2c9b85da85","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nigel Farage","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nigel-farage"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

Trump dismisses the idea that Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election, calling it a “made-up story,” “ridiculous,” and “a hoax.” He finds the subject so threatening to his legitimacy that—according to “[The Perfect Weapon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FPerfect-Weapon-Sabotage-Fear-Cyber\u002Fdp\u002F0451497899\u002Fref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=),” a recent book on cyber sabotage by David Sanger, of the _Times_—aides say he refuses even to discuss it. In public, Trump has characterized all efforts to investigate the foreign attacks on American democracy during the campaign as a “witch hunt”; in March, he insisted that “the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.”\n\nFew people, including Trump’s opponents, have publicly challenged the widespread belief that no obtainable evidence can prove that Russian interference changed any votes. Democrats, for the most part, have avoided attributing Hillary Clinton’s defeat directly to Russian machinations. They have more readily blamed [James Comey](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fpodcast\u002Fthe-new-yorker-radio-hour\u002Fjames-comey-makes-his-case-to-america), the former F.B.I. director, for reversing Clinton’s thin lead in the final days of the campaign by reopening a criminal investigation into her mishandling of classified e-mails. Many have also expressed frustration with Clinton’s weak performance as a candidate, and with her campaign’s tactical errors.

James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told me, “We try not to spy on Americans. It’s not in our charter.” He emphasized that, although he and other intelligence officials produced—and shared with Trump—a postelection report confirming an extensive cyberattack by Russia, the assessment did not attempt to gauge how this foreign meddling had affected American voters. Speaking for himself, however, he told me that “it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn’t turn the election.”\n\nOrdinarily, Congress would aggressively examine an electoral controversy of this magnitude, but the official investigations in the House and the Senate, led by Republicans, have been too stymied by partisanship to address the ultimate question of whether Trump’s victory was legitimate. Although the Senate hearings are still under way, the Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican, has already declared, “What we cannot do, however, is calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election.”\n\nEven the Clinton campaign has stopped short of attributing its loss to the Russians. Joel Benenson, the campaign’s pollster, told me that “a global power is fucking with our elections,” and that “every American should be outraged, whether it changed the outcome or not.” But _did_ the meddling alter the outcome? “How will we ever know?” he said. “We probably won’t, until some Russians involved in it are actually prosecuted—or some Republican, in a moment of conscience, talks.”\n\nPoliticians may be too timid to explore the subject, but a new book from, of all places, Oxford University Press promises to be incendiary. “[Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President—What We Don’t, Can’t, and Do Know](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002Fdp\u002FB07GJM18PL\u002Fref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, dares to ask—and even attempts to answer—whether Russian meddling had a decisive impact in 2016\\. Jamieson offers a forensic analysis of the available evidence and concludes that Russia very likely delivered Trump’s victory.\n\nThe book, which is coming out less than two months before the midterm elections, at a moment when polls suggest that some sixty per cent of voters disapprove of Trump, may well reignite the question of Trump’s electoral legitimacy. The President’s supporters will likely characterize the study as an act of partisan warfare. But in person Jamieson, who wears her gray hair in a pixie cut and favors silk scarves and matronly tweeds, looks more likely to suspend a troublemaker than to be one. She is seventy-one, and has spent forty years studying political speeches, ads, and debates. Since 1993, she has directed the Annenberg Public Policy Center, at Penn, and in 2003 she co-founded [FactCheck.org](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.factcheck.org\u002F), a nonpartisan watchdog group. She is widely respected by political experts in both parties, though her predominantly male peers have occasionally mocked her scholarly intensity, calling her the Drill Sergeant. As Steven Livingston, a professor of political communication at George Washington University, puts it, “She is the epitome of a humorless, no-nonsense social scientist driven by the numbers. She doesn’t bullshit. She calls it straight.”\n\nIndeed, when I met recently with Jamieson, in a book-lined conference room at the Annenberg Center, in Philadelphia, and asked her point-blank if she thought that Trump would be President without the aid of Russians, she didn’t equivocate. “No,” she said, her face unsmiling. Clearly cognizant of the gravity of her statement, she clarified, “If everything else is a constant? No, I do not.”\n\nJamieson said that, as an academic, she hoped that the public would challenge her arguments. Yet she expressed confidence that unbiased readers would accept her conclusion that it is not just plausible that Russia changed the outcome of the 2016 election—it is “_likely_ that it did.”\n\nAn airtight case, she acknowledges, may never be possible. In the introduction to her new book, she writes that any case for influence will likely be similar to that in a civil legal trial, “in which the verdict is rendered not with the certainty that e=mc^2^ but rather based on the preponderance of evidence.” But, she points out, “we do make most of life’s decisions based on less-than-rock-solid, incontrovertible evidence.” In Philadelphia, she noted to me that “we convict people on probabilities rather than absolute certainty, and we’ve executed people based on inferences from available evidence.” She argued that “the standard of proof being demanded” by people claiming it’s impossible to know whether Russia delivered the White House to Trump is “substantially higher than the standard of proof we ordinarily use in our lives.”\n\nHer case is based on a growing body of knowledge about the electronic warfare waged by Russian trolls and hackers—whom she terms “discourse saboteurs”—and on five decades’ worth of academic studies about what kinds of persuasion can influence voters, and under what circumstances. Democracies around the world, she told me, have begun to realize that subverting an election doesn’t require tampering with voting machines. Extensive studies of past campaigns, Jamieson said, have demonstrated that “you can affect people, who then change their decision, and _that_ alters the outcome.” She continued, “I’m not arguing that Russians pulled the voting levers. I’m arguing that they persuaded enough people to either vote a certain way or not vote at all.”\n\nThe effect of such manipulations could be momentous in an election as close as the 2016 race, in which Clinton got nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, and Trump won the Electoral College only because some eighty thousand votes went his way in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In two hundred and twenty-four pages of extremely dry prose, with four appendixes of charts and graphs and fifty-four pages of footnotes, Jamieson makes a strong case that, in 2016, “Russian masterminds” pulled off a technological and political coup. Moreover, she concludes, the American media “inadvertently helped them achieve their goals.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen Jamieson set out to research the 2016 campaign—she has researched every Presidential election since 1976—she had no intention of lobbing a grenade. She was spending a peaceful sabbatical as a fellow at the Shorenstein Center, at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, exploring a rather narrow topic: the 2016 Presidential debates. She’d chosen this subject because, having devoted decades to examining the impact of advertising and other forms of persuasion on voters, she believed that most of the big questions in the field of political-campaign communications had been answered. Also, she admitted, “I have what you could call a debate fixation. Every year since 1996 I’ve done some kind of social-science look at the effects of debates.”\n\nThis expertise helped Jamieson notice something odd about the three debates between Trump and Clinton. As she told me, “The conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton had done pretty well.” According to CNN polls conducted immediately after the debates, she won all three, by a margin of thirteen per cent or greater. But, during the period of the debates, Jamieson and others at the Annenberg Center had overseen three telephone surveys, each sampling about a thousand adults. In an election that turned more than most on judgments of character, Americans who saw or heard the second and third debates, in particular, were more likely than those who hadn’t to agree that Clinton “says one thing in public and something else in private.” Jamieson found this statistic curious, because, by the time of the first debate, on September 26th, Clinton’s reputation for candor had already been tarnished by her failed attempt to hide the fact that she’d developed pneumonia, and by the revelation that, at a recent fund-raising event, she’d described some Trump supporters as “deplorables”—a slur that contradicted her slogan “Stronger Together.” Other Annenberg Center polling data indicated to Jamieson that concerns about Clinton being two-faced had been “baked in” voters’ minds since before the first debate. Clinton “had already been attacked for a very long time over that,” Jamieson recalls thinking. “Why would the debates have had an additional effect?”\n\nAfter insuring that the surveys had been properly conducted, Jamieson analyzed whether this change in a voter’s perception of Clinton’s forthrightness predicted a change in his or her candidate preference. To her surprise, she found that it did: as she put it to me, there was a “small but significant drop in reported _intention_ to vote for her.” This statistic, too, struck Jamieson as curious; she knew from years of scholarship that Presidential debates, barring major gaffes, typically “increase the likelihood that you’re casting a vote for, rather than against,” a candidate.\n\nLast year, while Jamieson was trying to determine what could have caused viewers’ perception of Clinton’s character to fall so consequentially, the Washington _Post_ asked her to write an [op-ed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fnews\u002Fposteverything\u002Fwp\u002F2017\u002F11\u002F10\u002Fcould-russian-trolls-have-helped-elect-donald-trump\u002F?utm_term=.2db01666fd23) addressing whether Russian operatives had helped to elect Trump. Jamieson agreed to do so, but, she admitted to me, “I frankly hadn’t thought about it one way or the other.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5ba57f93ff144d2ceacd68cf]||||||\n+++\n\nJamieson is scrupulously nonpartisan in her work. Beth Myers, who helped lead Mitt Romney’s Presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and worked with Jamieson on a bipartisan project about Presidential debates, told me, “If Kathleen has a point of view, I don’t know what it is. She’s extraordinarily evenhanded. She is fair and fearless.” Anita Dunn, a Democratic adviser to Barack Obama, agrees. She, too, worked with Jamieson on the Presidential-debates project, and she studied with her as an undergraduate. Jamieson, she says, “is constantly pointing out what the data actually shows, as opposed to those of us who just assert stuff.”\n\nJamieson began her study of the 2016 election with an open mind. But, in the fall of 2017, as she watched the House and the Senate hold hearings on Russia’s social-media manipulations, and reviewed the sampling of dozens of Facebook ads released by the House Intelligence Committee—all paid for by Russians during the Presidential campaign—she developed suspicions about the reasons behind Trump’s victory. Before the hearings, Facebook’s chairman and C.E.O., [Mark Zuckerberg](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2018\u002F09\u002F17\u002Fcan-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy), had maintained that the amount of Russian content that had been disseminated on social media was too small to matter. But evidence presented to the Senate committee revealed that material generated by the Kremlin had reached a hundred and twenty-six million American Facebook users, leading Senator Dianne Feinstein to call the cyberattack “cataclysmic.”\n\nHouse Democrats later released not only the ads but also their “targeting data”—the demographics and the geographic locations of users receiving them—which indicated to Jamieson “whom the Russians were going for.” Among other things, she could discern that the Russians had tried “to minimize the vote of African-Americans.” Bogus Kremlin-sponsored ads that had circulated online—including one depicting a black woman in front of an “*AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR HILLARY*{: .small}” sign—had urged voters to tweet or text rather than vote, or to “avoid the line” and “vote from home.”\n\nJamieson’s _Post_ article was grounded in years of scholarship on political persuasion. She noted that political messages are especially effective when they are sent by trusted sources, such as members of one’s own community. Russian operatives, it turned out, disguised themselves in precisely this way. As the _Times_ first [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F09\u002F07\u002Fus\u002Fpolitics\u002Frussia-facebook-twitter-election.html), on June 8, 2016, a Facebook user depicting himself as Melvin Redick, a genial family man from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, posted a link to DCLeaks.com, and wrote that users should check out “the hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US.” The profile photograph of “Redick” showed him in a backward baseball cap, alongside his young daughter—but Pennsylvania records showed no evidence of Redick’s existence, and the photograph matched an image of an unsuspecting man in Brazil. U.S. intelligence experts later announced, “with high confidence,” that DCLeaks was the creation of the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency.\n\nAcademic research has also shown that political messages tend not to change the minds of voters who have already chosen a candidate; they are most likely to persuade undecided voters. And in 2016 an uncommonly high percentage of voters liked neither candidate and stayed undecided longer than usual. By some counts, about thirty-seven million Americans—fifteen per cent of the electorate—were still undecided in the final weeks before the election.\n\nJamieson argues that the impact of the Russian cyberwar was likely enhanced by its consistency with messaging from Trump’s campaign, and by its strategic alignment with the campaign’s geographic and demographic objectives. Had the Kremlin tried to push voters in a new direction, its effort might have failed. But, Jamieson concluded, the Russian saboteurs nimbly amplified Trump’s divisive rhetoric on immigrants, minorities, and Muslims, among other signature topics, and targeted constituencies that he needed to reach. She noted that Russian trolls had created social-media posts clearly aimed at winning support for Trump from churchgoers and military families—key Republican voters who seemed likely to lack enthusiasm for a thrice-married nominee who had boasted of groping women, obtained multiple military deferments, mocked Gold Star parents and a former prisoner of war, and described the threat of venereal disease as his personal equivalent of the Vietcong. Russian trolls pretended to have the same religious convictions as targeted users, and often promoted Biblical memes, including one that showed Clinton as Satan, with budding horns, arm-wrestling with Jesus, alongside the message “ ‘Like’ if you want Jesus to win!” One Instagram post, portraying Clinton as uncaring about the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi, depicted a young American widow resting her head on a flag-draped coffin. Another post displayed contrasting images of a thin homeless veteran and a heavyset, swarthy man wearing an “*UNDOCUMENTED UNAFRAID UNAPOLOGETIC*{: .small}” T-shirt, and asked why “this veteran gets nothing” and “this illegal gets everything.” It concluded, “Like and share if you think this is a disgrace.” On Election Day, according to CNN exit polls, Trump, despite his political baggage, outperformed Clinton by twenty-six points among veterans; he also did better among evangelicals than both of the previous Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.\n\nIn her _Post_ article, Jamieson wrote that it was “hard to know” if Russian propaganda and dirty tricks—including the steady release of hacked e-mails, starting with Democratic National Committee correspondence that was leaked just before the Party’s convention—had made a decisive difference in 2016\\. Nevertheless, she argued, the “wide distribution” of the trolls’ disinformation “increases the likelihood” that it “changed the outcome.”\n\nAfter the article’s publication, she returned to her sabbatical project on the debates, with a newly keen eye for Russian trolls and hackers. After reviewing the debate transcripts, scrutinizing press coverage, and eliminating other possibilities, Jamieson concluded that there was only one credible explanation for the diminishing impression among debate viewers that Clinton was forthright: just before the second debate, WikiLeaks had released a cache of e-mails, obtained by Russian hackers, that, it said, were taken from the Gmail account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. They included excerpts from speeches that Clinton had given to banks, for high fees, and had refused to release during the campaign. The speeches could be used by detractors to show that, despite her liberal rhetoric, she was aligned with Wall Street. The hacked content permeated the discourse of the debates, informing both the moderators’ questions and the candidates’ answers. All this, Jamieson writes, gave legitimacy to the idea that Clinton “said one thing in public and another in private.”\n\nDuring the second debate, on October 9th, before 66.5 million viewers, one of the moderators, Martha Raddatz, relayed a question submitted by a voter: Did Clinton think that it was acceptable for a politician to be “two-faced”? The question referred to a leaked passage from one of Clinton’s previously unreleased paid speeches; Russian hackers had given the passage to WikiLeaks, which posted it two days before the debate. In the speech, Clinton had cited Steven Spielberg’s film “Lincoln” as an example of how politicians sometimes need to adopt different public and private negotiating stances. The point was scarcely novel, but the debate question—which took her words out of context, omitted her reference to the movie, and didn’t mention that Russian operatives had obtained the speech illegally—made Clinton sound like a sneaky hypocrite. When Clinton cited “Lincoln” in order to defend the statement, Trump pounced.\n\n“She got caught in a total lie!” Trump said. “Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks—Goldman Sachs and everybody else. And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out. And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln!”\n\nThe dynamic recurred in the third debate, on October 19th, which 71.6 million people watched. When Trump accused Clinton of favoring “open borders,” she denied it, but the moderator, Chris Wallace, challenged her by citing a snippet from a speech that she had given, in 2013, to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” Again, there was no mention of the fact that the speech had been stolen by a hostile foreign power; Wallace said that the quotation had come from WikiLeaks. The clear implication of Wallace’s question was that Clinton had been hiding her true beliefs, and Trump said to him, “Thank you!” His supporters in the audience laughed. Clinton said that the phrase had been taken out of context: she’d been referring not to immigrants but to an open-bordered electric grid with Latin America. She tried to draw attention to Russia’s role in hacking the speech, but Trump mocked her for accusing Putin, and joked, “That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders.” He then warned the audience that, if Clinton were elected, Syrians and other immigrants would “pour into our country.”\n\nThe fact-checking organization PolitiFact later [concluded](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.politifact.com\u002Ftruth-o-meter\u002Fstatements\u002F2016\u002Foct\u002F12\u002Fdonald-trump\u002Ftrump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-\u002F) that Trump had incorrectly characterized Clinton’s speech, but the damage had been done. Jamieson’s research indicated that viewers who watched the second and third debates subsequently saw Clinton as less forthright, and Trump as _more_ forthright. Among people who did not watch the debates, Clinton’s reputation was not damaged in this way. During the weeks that the debates took place, the moderators and the media became consumed by an anti-Clinton narrative driven by Russian hackers. In “Cyberwar,” Jamieson writes, “The stolen goods lent credibility” to “those moderator queries.”\n\nAs Jamieson reviewed the record further, she concluded that the Russian hackers had also been alarmingly successful in reframing the American political narrative in the crucial period leading up to the second debate. On Friday, October 7th, two days before it took place, three major stories landed in rapid succession. At 12:40 *P.M.*{: .small}, the Obama Administration released a stunning [statement](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.dhs.gov\u002Fnews\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F07\u002Fjoint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national), by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence, accusing the Russian government of interfering in the election through hacking. This seemed certain to dominate the weekend news, but at 4:03 *P.M.*{: .small} the Washington _Post_ published a [report](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fpolitics\u002Ftrump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F07\u002F3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?postshare=2491475870527101&tid=ss_tw), by David Fahrenthold, on an “Access Hollywood” tape that captured Trump, on a hot mike, boasting about grabbing women “by the pussy.” Then, less than half an hour later, WikiLeaks released its first [tranche of e-mails](https:\u002F\u002Fwikileaks.org\u002Fpodesta-emails\u002F) that Russian hackers had stolen from Podesta’s account. The tranche contained some two thousand messages, along with excerpts from the paid speeches that Clinton had tried to conceal, including those that would be mentioned in the subsequent debates. ([Julian Assange](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F08\u002F21\u002Fjulian-assange-a-man-without-a-country), the head of WikiLeaks, has denied working with the Russian government, but he manifestly despises Clinton, and, in a leaked Twitter direct message, he said that in the 2016 election “it would be much better for GOP to win.”)\n\nIf the WikiLeaks release was a Russian-backed effort to rescue Trump’s candidacy by generating a scandal to counterbalance the “Access Hollywood” tape and the intelligence report on Russian interference, Jamieson writes, it worked splendidly. The intelligence community’s report faded from the headlines; that Sunday morning, none of its authors were invited on any major talk show. Instead, the programs breathlessly discussed the “pussy” tape and the Clinton campaign’s e-mails, which were portrayed as more or less exposing both candidates as liars. Jamieson notes, “Instead of asking how we could know that the Russians were behind the hacking, the October 9 Sunday show moderators asked what effect the disclosures would have on the candidates’ respective campaigns and what the tape and speech segments revealed about the private versus public selves of the contenders.” If not for WikiLeaks, she writes, the media discourse in those crucial days likely would have remained locked on two topics advantageous to Clinton: Russian election subversion and Trump’s treatment of women.\n\nJamieson also argues that, in most hotly contested elections, the candidates blunt each other’s messages, which results in fairly balanced media coverage. In 2016, she believes, Russia’s involvement upset this equilibrium. She asks readers to imagine how different the 2016 election might have been if Trump’s campaign had also been hacked, disgorging the e-mails of Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump, Jr. Among other things, this would have exposed correspondence about the notorious June, 2016, Trump Tower [meeting](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F11\u002Fus\u002Fpolitics\u002Ftrump-russia-email-clinton.html) with a Russian lawyer, and Trump’s [payoffs](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Ftrump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678) to a pornographic actress and to a _Playboy_ model. Documents that Trump has kept concealed, such as his tax returns, also might have come to light. Instead, Jamieson writes, throughout the autumn of 2016 a steady stream of content stolen from the Clinton campaign—which the press generally described as coming from WikiLeaks, rather than from Russia—“reweighted the news environment in Trump’s favor.”\n\nAs Jamieson dug further into Russia’s discourse saboteurs, she decided that she had the makings of a book. Most discussions about the 2016 election results, she believed, had been misguidedly framed around the question of whether the Russians had “changed votes directly.” There wasn’t evidence for this. Instead, she suspected, the Russians had “influenced who voted, or didn’t vote, and _that_ could have changed the outcome.”\n\nShe set aside her debates project and continued sleuthing. She amassed more evidence this past February, when the Justice Department, in connection with the Mueller probe, released a detailed indictment of thirteen Russians working at the [Internet Research Agency](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2015\u002F06\u002F07\u002Fmagazine\u002Fthe-agency.html), a troll farm in St. Petersburg. The operatives were described as having worked day and night waging “information warfare against the United States of America.” Then, in July, Mueller [indicted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fcurrent\u002Fguccifer-indictment-robert-mueller) twelve Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The indictment maintained that the Russian government had executed a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, infiltrating their computers and implanting malware that, in some instances, enabled spies to covertly monitor their keystrokes. As the _Times_ [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F07\u002F13\u002Fus\u002Fpolitics\u002Fmueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html), the Russians had leaked stolen files “in stages,” a tactic “that wreaked havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season.”\n\nStrikingly, the July indictment showed that Russian hackers’ first attempt to infiltrate the computer servers in Clinton’s personal offices had taken place on July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump had declared, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the thirty thousand e-mails that are missing,” adding, “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”\n\nAnother revelation from the indictment which jumped out at Jamieson was that the Russian hackers had stolen the Clinton campaign’s data analytics and voter-turnout models. A month later, when we met in Philadelphia, Jamieson said, “So we’re starting to close in on a pretty strong inference that they had everything needed to target the messaging” at “key constituencies that did effectively mobilize in this election.” Cocking an eyebrow, she added, “The possibility that this happened starts to become a probability—starts to become a _likelihood_—pretty quickly.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJoel Benenson, the Clinton pollster, was stunned when he learned, from the July indictment, that the Russians had stolen his campaign’s internal modelling. “I saw it and said, ‘Holy shit!’ ” he told me. Among the proprietary information that the Russian hackers could have obtained, he said, was campaign data showing that, late in the summer of 2016, in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, an unusually high proportion of residents whose demographic and voting profiles identified them as likely Democrats were “Hillary defectors”: people so unhappy with Clinton that they were considering voting for a third-party candidate. The Clinton campaign had a plan for winning back these voters. Benenson explained that any Clinton opponent who stole this data would surely have realized that the best way to counter the plan was to bombard those voters with negative information about Clinton. “All they need to do is keep that person where they are,” he said, which is far easier than persuading a voter to switch candidates. Many critics have accused Clinton of taking Michigan and Wisconsin for granted and spending virtually no time there. But Benenson said that, if a covert social-media campaign targeting “Hillary defectors” was indeed launched in battleground states, it might well have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nBenenson said, “We lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin—three states of our Blue Wall—by about eighty thousand votes. Six hundred and sixty thousand votes were cast in those three states for third-party candidates. Winning those three states would have got us to two hundred and seventy-eight electoral votes.” In other words, if only twelve per cent of those third-party voters were persuaded by Russian propaganda—based on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics—not to vote for Clinton, then Jamieson’s theory could be valid.\n\nBenenson said that, when he first learned about the theft, he “called another consultant on the campaign and said, ‘This is unreal.’ ” The consultant reminded him that, in focus groups with undecided voters in the fall of 2016, “we’d hear these things like ‘I really hate Trump, but Hillary’s going to _murder_ all these people’—all sorts of crazy stuff.” Benenson admitted that many Americans had long disliked the Clintons, and had for years spread exaggerated rumors of their alleged misdeeds and deceptions. But he wonders if some of those conspiracy-minded voters hadn’t been unknowingly influenced by Russian propagandists who were marshalling the Clinton campaign’s own analytics.\n\nPhilip Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, in England, agrees that the Russian interference could have been decisive, but he is less convinced that the stolen analytics were key. He told me, “It’s plausible, but the Russians wouldn’t have needed the Clinton campaign—they could just as easily have targeted the network of Bernie Sanders supporters.”\n\n“Did we make mistakes?” Benenson asked, about the Clinton campaign’s performance. “Sure.” But, he said, he believes that Russian interference in the 2016 election was “the biggest threat to democracy we’ve ever had in this country, other than the wars we’ve had to fight.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJamieson has long been respected by the Washington media establishment, but it’s a safe bet that the Trump White House will dismiss her work as more “fake news.” A senior Trump adviser who was involved in the 2016 campaign, and has yet to see Jamieson’s book, recently sent me a text: “Where is the evidence? And when do people start to feel ashamed that they can’t accept the election results and the crappy candidate they ran?”\n\nOther academics may also be skeptical of “Cyberwar.” A forthcoming book on the 2016 campaign, “[Identity Crisis](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002Fdp\u002FB0753RMMHC\u002Fref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” by the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, argues that Russian interference was not a major factor in the Presidential election, and that the hacked e-mails “did not clearly affect” perceptions of Clinton. Instead, they write, Trump’s exploitation of divisive race, gender, religious, and ethnicity issues accounted for his win. But the two books are not necessarily incompatible: Jamieson shows that Russian saboteurs inflamed polarizing identity issues, including resentment among whites that minority groups were benefitting at the expense of “real” Americans—which is exactly what “Identity Crisis” says swung the election.\n\nRecently, Brendan Nyhan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, [suggested](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F13\u002Fupshot\u002Ffake-news-and-bots-may-be-worrisome-but-their-political-power-is-overblown.html), in the _Times,_ that most fears about the impact of Russian information warfare in the 2016 campaign are exaggerated. He wrote that “a growing number of studies conclude” that “most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all,” and cited studies suggesting that television ads, direct mail, and door-to-door canvassing rarely sway voters. Moreover, he argued, though the number of Russian-sponsored messages during the 2016 campaign might sound alarmingly large, the universe of information that most voters are exposed to is so vast that the impact of fake news, and other malicious online misinformation, is diluted. He noted, “Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election—certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.” He concluded, “It’s hard to change people’s minds!”\n\nConservative news outlets like the Daily Caller have embraced the view that Russia’s social-media operations were negligible. But Jonathan Albright, of Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who has been at the forefront of documenting the spread of online disinformation from Russia and other sources, describes the “drop in the bucket” argument as a case of “false framing.” He told me, “A better way to think of it is not as a drop of solution but as _pollution_. Every piece of messaging has some effect.” It’s misleading, he says, to focus only on the relatively small number of obvious propaganda messages, such as paid Facebook ads. Far more important, in the 2016 campaign, was “organic content”: the countless messages, created by masked Russian social-media accounts, that were spread by algorithms, bots, and unwitting American users. The reach of such content, he told me, “turned out to be huge.” Of the four hundred and seventy Facebook accounts known to have been created by Russian saboteurs during the campaign, a mere six of them generated content that was shared at least three hundred and forty million times. The Facebook page for a fake group, Blacktivist, which stoked racial tensions by posting militant slogans and stomach-churning videos of police violence against African-Americans, garnered more hits than the Facebook page for Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe Blacktivist ruse was part of a larger Russian plot to divide Americans, according to Senator Mark Warner, the vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. An expert told the committee that automated accounts typically push extremist views twenty-five to thirty times more often than authentic American social-media users do. “It blew my mind,” he told me. “It was an OMG moment. The extremes are screaming while the majority whispers.”\n\nIt is now understood that Russia’s influence was far larger than social-media companies originally acknowledged. Facebook initially claimed that Russian disinformation posted during the campaign had likely reached only ten million Facebook users; it subsequently amended the figure to a hundred and twenty-six million. Twitter recently acknowledged that it, too, was deeply infiltrated, hosting more than fifty thousand impostor accounts.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F5ba57f9335a8542db76ba1d9]||||||\n+++\n\nJames Clapper told me, “It’s hard to convey to people how massive an assault this was,” and added, “I think the Russians have more to do with making Clinton lose than Trump did.” Yet he remains cautious about saying that this is provable. So does Albright, of the Tow Center. He has accumulated a huge quantity of data documenting Russian meddling, but he believes that it remains “difficult to quantify what the impact was on the outcome.” He told me that Russian interference “provoked outrage, created discontent with social systems such as police and safety, pushed certain urban and disadvantaged communities to feel marginalized, and amplified wedge issues beyond authentic reach through social media, which then magnified media coverage of certain issues.” He went on, “That’s an impact. But to translate that into voting patterns is very difficult.” Michael Hayden, the former director of the C.I.A. and the N.S.A., is also agnostic. He has called the Russian attacks “the most successful covert influence operation in history,” but concludes that, although Russian hackers may have, as he put it, “put their thumb on the American electoral scale,” there’s simply “no telling the impact. . . . It’s not just unknown, it’s unknowable.”\n\nJamieson quotes Hayden making this argument, but writes that she must respectfully disagree.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n“Cyberwar” doesn’t simply document Russia’s hacking and social-media campaigns. It also pinpoints another, less well-known, instance of Russian sabotage, and Jamieson argues that this dirty trick, in combination with the actions of trolls and hackers, may have changed the course of the 2016 campaign. In her telling, James Comey’s decision to issue a series of damaging public pronouncements on Clinton’s handling of classified e-mails can plausibly be attributed to Russian disinformation. As evidence, Jamieson cites Comey’s own story, told in interviews and in his recent memoir, of what happened behind the scenes.\n\nJamieson became curious as she watched Comey, on July 5, 2016, make the first of three public statements during the campaign about e-mails that Clinton had mishandled while serving as Obama’s Secretary of State. At a press conference, Comey announced his intention to recommend that the Justice Department not charge Clinton, but first he denounced her actions as “extremely careless.” Jamieson recalls wondering, “Why are you doing this?” She told me, “It was odd.”\n\nOrdinarily, when the F.B.I. ends an investigation with no charges, it says nothing. In very high-profile cases, it sometimes issues a “declination” statement. But, even though Comey wasn’t the head of the Justice Department—he was only the F.B.I. director—he had unilaterally designated himself the spokesman for the entire investigation, and had called a live press conference without asking the permission of his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nAs Jamieson worked on her manuscript, she noticed that Comey repeatedly hinted that his decision to preëmpt his boss was prompted, in part, by classified information, which, if leaked, would undermine the over-all integrity of the Clinton probe. In public, he mysteriously declined to be more specific about this intelligence, but claimed that it had compounded concerns already stirred by an impromptu private visit between Lynch and Bill Clinton, on June 27th, at an Arizona airport.\n\nSix months after the election, the Washington _Post_ [broke a story](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fworld\u002Fnational-security\u002Fhow-a-dubious-russian-document-influenced-the-fbis-handling-of-the-clinton-probe\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F24\u002Ff375c07c-3a95-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.f9bb78afe3fa) that solved the mystery. At some point in 2016, the F.B.I. had received unverified Russian intelligence describing purported e-mails from Lynch to a member of the Clinton team, in which she promised that she’d go easy on Clinton. An unnamed source told the _Post_ that the intelligence had been viewed as “junk.” Nonetheless, Comey has reportedly told aides that he let the disinformation shape his decision to sideline Lynch. Fearing, in part, that conservatives would create a furor if the alleged e-mails became public, he began to feel that Lynch “could not credibly participate in announcing a declination.” A subsequent report, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, described Comey’s behavior as “extraordinary and insubordinate,” and found his justifications unpersuasive.\n\nNick Merrill, a former Clinton-campaign spokesman, describes Comey’s actions as “mind-blowing.” He said of the intelligence impugning Lynch, “It was a Russian forgery. But Comey based major decisions in the Justice Department on Russian disinformation because of the _optics_ of it! The Russians targeted the F.B.I., hoping they’d act on it, and then he went ahead and did so.”\n\nIn the fake Russian intelligence, one of the Clinton-campaign officials accused of conspiring with Lynch was Amanda Renteria. She was shocked to learn of the allegations, and told me that, although she is friendly with _a_ woman named Loretta Lynch—a political figure in California—she does not know _the_ Loretta Lynch who was the Attorney General. Renteria said, “To me, it says that, in the new world of politics, even if something isn’t real, it can still move things. You aren’t living in the world of reality anymore.”\n\nComey declined to comment for this article, citing the classified nature of the intelligence in question. As with the other incidents described in Jamieson’s book, it is hard to assess precisely how much of a difference his damaging statements about Clinton made at the voting booth. But it certainly didn’t help her candidacy when, just ten days before the election, Comey—reprising his self-appointed spokesperson role—announced that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation because more Clinton e-mails had been found. Seven days later, he made a third announcement, clearing her again. Adam Schiff, the Democratic representative who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that, if you take Comey at his word that the fake intelligence drove his decision to publicly censor Clinton in the first place—there are skeptics who suspect that Comey’s grandstanding moralism was a bigger factor—then “it probably was the most measurable” and “the most significant way in which the Russians may have impacted the outcome of the election.”\n\nPolls suggest the likely impact. According to the Web site [FiveThirtyEight](https:\u002F\u002Ffivethirtyeight.com\u002F), at midnight on October 28, 2016, the day Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation, Clinton was ahead of Trump by 5.9 per cent. A week later, her lead had shrunk to 2.9 per cent. Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, has noted that, during this time, coverage of the Clinton e-mail investigation dominated the news, “drowning out other headlines.” According to researchers at Microsoft, the _Times_ ran as many front-page stories on the e-mails that week as it ran front-page stories about the candidates’ policy proposals in the final few months of the campaign. Silver concluded that all the talk about Clinton’s e-mails may have shifted the race by as much as four points, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida to Trump, and possibly North Carolina and Arizona, too.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJamieson, ever the social scientist, emphasizes in her book that there is much that Americans still don’t know about the campaign, including the detailed targeting information that would clarify exactly whom the Russian disinformation was aimed at, and when it was sent. She told me, “We need to know the extent to which the Russians targeted the three key states, and which citizens’ voting patterns differed substantially from the ones you would have predicted in the past.”\n\nPhilip Howard, the Oxford professor, believes that Facebook possesses this data, down to the location of a user’s computer, and that such information could conceivably reveal whether an undecided voter was swayed after viewing certain content. He also thinks that, if there was any collusion between the St. Petersburg trolls and the Trump campaign, Facebook’s internal data could document it, by revealing coördination on political posts. But, he says, Facebook has so far resisted divulging such data to researchers, claiming that doing so would be a breach of its user agreement.\n\nEven if this targeting information were released, though, questions would remain. Jamieson notes that postelection interviews are often unhelpful, since few voters are able to accurately recount what influenced their decision. Scholars know even less about nonvoters. As a result, she writes in “Cyberwar,” efforts to make an “ironclad” case will be “thwarted by unknowns.” Nevertheless, her book concludes that “Russian trolls and hackers helped elect a US president.”\n\nJamieson told me that one of her greatest concerns is that voters were unaware of the foreign effort to manipulate them on social media. Had the public known, she believes, there likely would have been a significant backlash. “We want voters to be aware of who is trying to influence them,” she said. “That’s the reason we have disclosure requirements on our campaign ads. We’ve known, at least since Aristotle in Western culture, that the source is judged as part of the message.”\n\nAmericans eager to declare Trump’s election illegitimate will be disappointed by one of Jamieson’s arguments. Regardless of her findings about the Russian scheme, she writes that, “barring evidence of tampering” with voting machines or ballot boxes, “Trump is the duly elected President of the United States.” She says that she will leave it to others to decide whether Trump should remain in office if conclusive evidence emerges that he colluded with the Kremlin in order to win the election. “My personal judgment is yes, even then Mr. Trump would be President,” she writes. “But probably not for long.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e6270a23f7a2cc1a7cb9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca141c92e2c9b85da59","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pres.
