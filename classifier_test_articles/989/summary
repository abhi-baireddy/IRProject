Cuts to U.K. government spending on benefits and anemic economic growth could produce record levels of child poverty by the end of the current Parliament, the Resolution Foundation has warned.
If housing costs are included, the proportion of children living in poverty is set to rise to 37 percent, above the previous high of 34 percent in the early 1990s.
The think tank said its projected poverty levels were due to the failure of nominal pay growth to recover to prefinancial crisis levels of 4 percent.
Pay growth reached 3 percent year-on-year in late 2018, but barely increased over the past decade.
According to the report, the effects of low pay growth for some of the hardest-hit groups were exacerbated by the effects of government benefit cuts.
