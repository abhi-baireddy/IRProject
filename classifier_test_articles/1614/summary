WASHINGTONâ€”The Trump administration has moved to deny bail to some asylum seekers at the southern border, amid a surge of Central American immigrant families.
If the ruling issued by Attorney General William Barr Tuesday takes effect, it could mean that asylum seekers could spend more time in jail while their cases are decided.
The ruling is due to be implemented in 90 days so that the Department of Homeland Security can conduct additional operational planning, the Justice Department said.
