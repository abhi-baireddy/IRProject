A plume of smoke from a petrochemical fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company is shown over downtown Houston Monday, March 18, 2019.
The large fire at the Houston-area petrochemicals terminal will likely burn for another two days, authorities said Monday, noting that air quality around the facility was testing within normal guidelines.

Monitoring conducted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency also reported nothing alarming, officials at those agencies said.
But fog is forecast for the area Wednesday morning, which could drag the plume downward and make air quality worse, officials said.
