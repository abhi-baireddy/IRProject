The killers will be sentenced later this month for the murder of Mr Brewster in Cardiff in June 2016.
Father-of-three Mr Brewster was stabbed to death with a hunting knife in 'callous, cold-blooded' killing in broad daylight during a row with drugs dealer Whelan.
Det Con Bryant, 46, had sent text messages to juror Lauren Jones to keep quiet about knowing each other ahead of the trial.
'The police officer also failed to say anything to anybody although she was aware that the juror was sitting on the murder trial.'
'Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Brewster who we have continued to support throughout this difficult time.'
