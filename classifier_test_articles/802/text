One of the first victims of the New Zealand mosque massacre to be buried was a “caring and polite” teenage boy who was on the phone with his mother when he was killed.

Hamza Mustafa, 15, and his father, Khalid Mustafa, 44, were laid to rest Wednesday in a special grave designated for the 50 victims of the mass shooting.

Authorities spent four days constructing the grave site in Christchurch, where hundreds of mourners flocked to pay their respects.

Hamza, a student at Cashmere High School in Christchurch was compassionate, hard-working and an excellent horseback rider who wanted to become a veterinarian, his principal Mark Wilson told the Associated Press.

The teen had been praying at the Al Noor mosque with his dad and younger brother Friday. He called his mother moments after the gunman opened fire.

“He said: ‘Mum, there’s someone come into the mosque and he’s shooting us’ and he was running with his brother who had been shot in the leg,” the grief-stricken mother, Salwa Mustafa, recalled to Stuff.NZ.

“After that, I heard shooting and he screamed and after that I didn’t hear him,” she continued. “I called, ‘Hamza, Hamza,’ and I can hear his little voice and after that it was quiet.”

The mother described Hamza as “the most wonderful boy” and “very caring and polite.” She said her husband was “a very nice father and a very caring person.”

Hamza’s younger brother, 13-year-old Zaed, suffered gunshot wounds to the leg in the attack.

The service for Hamza and his father took place five days after the anti-Muslim attack on worshipers during services.

So far, six of the victims’ bodies have been returned to their families. And only 21 of the victims have been formally identified by coroners.
