One of the first victims of the New Zealand mosque massacre to be buried was a “caring and polite” teenage boy who was on the phone with his mother when he was killed.
Hamza Mustafa, 15, and his father, Khalid Mustafa, 44, were laid to rest Wednesday in a special grave designated for the 50 victims of the mass shooting.
Authorities spent four days constructing the grave site in Christchurch, where hundreds of mourners flocked to pay their respects.
The teen had been praying at the Al Noor mosque with his dad and younger brother Friday.
The service for Hamza and his father took place five days after the anti-Muslim attack on worshipers during services.
