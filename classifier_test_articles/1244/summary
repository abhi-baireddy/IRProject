Defendants refused to provide them.”The heart of the suit comes down to a 2017 contract that the NRA negotiated with AMc.
The NRA is concerned that AMc has been over-billing the gun rights group for the work of third-party contractors, the lawsuit said.
But the ad firm has allegedly refused to give the NRA a range of financial information, including documents surrounding the 2017 contract.
That included budgets that the NRA “purportedly approved,” “copies of material contracts for which the NRA is purportedly liable,” and NRATV performance metrics.
However, the NRATV manager allegedly refused to provide the NRA with a full copy of the contract.
