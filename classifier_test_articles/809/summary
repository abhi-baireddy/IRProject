Despite employee turnover that perennially ranks near the highest in the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has defenders among her former staff.
“That wasn’t O.K.,” she recalled Ms. Klobuchar telling her.
Many of the aides said they had worked for both men and women, for lawmakers both compassionate and unkind, without encountering anyone else like Ms. Klobuchar.
Ms. Klobuchar is among them, but former aides said they were especially troubled by her willingness — in excess of other senators’, they said — to embarrass staff members over minor missteps or with odd requests.
Saving potentially damaging emails from Ms. Klobuchar became something of a last-day ritual, the aides said, in case they ever needed evidence of her conduct for their own reputational protection.
