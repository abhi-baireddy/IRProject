Polis is scheduled to sign the National Popular Vote bill, which recently was approved by the Democratic-controlled majorities in the state House and Senate.
It would give Colorado's nine Electoral College votes to the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide.
But there are not enough yet to give the popular-vote winner the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.
Bypassing the Electoral College would make the major urban centers that lean heavily Democratic the focus of election campaigns.
WND also asked how a national popular vote would affect the ability of Colorado voters to influence national elections.
