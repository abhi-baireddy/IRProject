For Stuart Varney, "fair" apparently means keeping all the money one earns in a country where the government socializes loss while privatizing profit.
He was primed for bear, or in this case, Bernie Sanders, who told Martha McCallum the night before that he supported a 52 percent income tax rate on the rich and an estate tax of far more.
Where is the fairness in taking more, wait, wait, wait.
Bernie Sanders constantly goes back to the idea he has a fair plan.
First, there's no fairness in Walmart workers having to go on food stamps to supplement their full time paychecks either.
