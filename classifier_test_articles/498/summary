Pro-Israel America launched Tuesday endorsing 27 candidates, 14 Democrats and 13 Republicans.
All have long histories of working with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to advance the brand of pro-Israel legislation it favors.
Chairing Pro-Israel America is Jonathan Missner, formerly the managing director for national affairs at AIPAC, and directing it is Jeff Mendelsohn, formerly AIPAC’s national outreach director.
J Street’s affiliated PAC backs Democrats who embrace the group’s ethos that one can be pro-Israel and sharply critical of its right-wing government.
“The best way to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship is to elect pro-Israel candidates to Congress, and that requires political action from the thousands of Americans who care deeply about this issue,” Mendelsohn said in a release.
