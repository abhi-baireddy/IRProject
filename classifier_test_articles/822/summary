Ohio Attorney General David Yost sent letters to state abortion providers Friday telling them to temporarily stop performing elective abortions and other nonessential procedures, and defined what that meant.
"You and your facility are ordered to immediately stop performing non-essential and elective surgical abortions," Yost's letter said.
"Non-essential surgical abortions are those that can be delayed without undue risk to the current or future health of a patient."
The response: Five out of the six abortion providers in the state have expressed intent to continue performing abortions, arguing that the procedures are essential.
Some states, such as Massachusetts and Washington, have classified abortion as an essential procedure and therefore exempt from any pause on elective procedures.
