MIAMI — As 3 p.m. approached on Monday, the editors of The Eagle Eye student newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., huddled around their adviser’s desk for the announcement of this year’s Pulitzer Prizes.

They watched not as journalism groupies, but as award contenders.

In an unusual move, the staff had submitted an entry to the most prestigious of journalism prizes for coverage of the mass shooting at their school, including a special memorial issue devoted entirely to 17 detailed obituaries honoring the classmates, teachers and coaches they lost on Feb. 14, 2018.

“We knew it was a long shot,” said Hannah Kapoor, 18, one of the newspaper’s co-editors in chief.

As it happened, when Dana Canedy, the Pulitzer awards’ administrator, began to announce the winners, The Eagle Eye was the first publication she named.

“I want to break with tradition and offer my sincere admiration for an entry that did not win, but that should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy,” Ms. Canedy said. Then she cited The Eagle Eye’s submission, which described how Parkland’s 44 student reporters and editors had to “put aside our grief and recognize our role as both survivors, journalists and loved ones of the deceased.”
