WASHINGTON – The House on Wednesday will hold its first major vote on gun control legislation in years, bringing to the floor two bills aimed at strengthening the background check system for gun purchases.
The changes would be the biggest expansion of the system since background checks were first required 25 years ago.
Currently, only federally licensed firearms dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct background checks on customers under federal law.
(Twenty states and D.C. have already expanded background checks to include at least some private sales.)
Opponents say background checks are worthless unless they are paired with a national gun registry, and that would intrude on gun owners’ rights.
