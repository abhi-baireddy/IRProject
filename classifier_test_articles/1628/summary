Disgraced real estate developer Charles Kushner would meet with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker in an office stairwell during the time he was living in a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey, according to a new book.
Booker was elected mayor of Newark in May 2006, shortly after Kushner’s release from prison.
The elder Kushner had supported Booker’s unsuccessful 2002 candidacy for mayor, reportedly steering $50,000 to his bid.
His opponent, four-term mayor Sharpe James, claimed Booker was “collaborating with Jews to take over Newark.”Ward writes that the link continued in 2006, despite Kushner’s conviction.
Ward writes that Kushner, “in front of people on a job site” had “shouted at Booker on the phone, saying he had ‘betrayed’ him.”
