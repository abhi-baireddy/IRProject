Outside of knowing Wuhan coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, United States intelligence agencies are still working on nailing down exactly where in the city the virus came from.
There's been speculation it came from an infected animal, likely a bat, that was sold and eaten at a Wuhan wet market.
But increasingly it looks like the disease came from a bat being studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology or another laboratory in the vicinity.
The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus â€” even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.
The theory that the virus escaped from a lab is one Republican Senator Tom Cotton has been following since the beginning.
