Vance thread, I mentioned that reader Sam M., who lives in western Pennsylvania, has written in this space, and privately to me, that the employers in his area who offer good manufacturing jobs cannot fill them.
They do not have enough workers to fill the jobs.
But 40 years ago, the town drunk wasnâ€™t getting tossed into jail three times a year for drunk driving.
Companies are basically pleading with young men to learn and perform skilled labor for great money (and no student loan debt burdens) yet have precious few takers.
Just unbelievably sad seeing this torpor of malaise strangling the young men in our culture.
