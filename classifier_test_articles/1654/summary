Wikimedia CommonsBenjamin Netanyahu has always pandered to Israel’s darkest forces when it suits his purposes.
He vowed to annex the West Bank settlements, which, if implemented, this would kill any viable hope for an eventual two-state solution.
During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to say whether the administration would oppose Israel’s unilateral annexation of the West Bank.
Most recently, the president gave Netanyahu an enormous campaign gift—recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights—without getting anything in return.
Negotiations are now under way between Netanyahu and smaller right-wing parties as the prime minister looks to form his conservative government.
