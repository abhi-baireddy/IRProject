White House/Wikimedia CommonsOur system has a big flaw: the attorney general of the United States works for the president rather than at the pleasure of the legislature.
The attorneys want the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials, the sources said.
It should be obvious that the White House will see what Mueller has produced the second the public sees it.
If Republican members of Congress see the case before the public, they will immediately leak it to the White House.
When we add in that he can demand to see the evidence before Congress sees it and that he can in some ways limit or control what evidence Congress will see, it gets to be something more than a shield or a barrier.
