Pelosi condemned Trump for the video, but she did not initially mention Omar, who was the target of Trump’s video, by name.
“Since the President’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video," Omar said in a statement Sunday evening.
On the president's attacks against Omar, Hammill said: "The President is making these attacks because of the imminent release of the Mueller report in a desperate attempt to change the subject."
Erin Scott/Sipa USA via APRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is also Muslim, expressed frustration over how Democratic leadership was handling Trump’s attacks against Omar.
Just hours after Omar released a statement reporting a surge of threats against her life following a tweeted attack from Trump, Trump again took aim at Omar on Monday by describing her as Pelosi’s “leader."
