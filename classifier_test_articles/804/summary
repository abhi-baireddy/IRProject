The Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest Catholic fraternal group, launched a multi-million-dollar food drive and delivery operation Tuesday, mobilizing its 1.25 million members in the United States to aid food banks in over 20 cities during the coronavirus crisis.
The Knights of Columbus has donated more than $55,000 to cover the costs of broadcasting Holy Week celebrations from the Vatican.
Knights of Columbus members, as well as the public at large, may contribute to “Leave No Neighbor Behind” by visiting www.kofc.org.
According to a press release, the Knights will provide $100,000 each to food banks in New York, Connecticut, and Los Angeles.
Additional $50,000 donations will also go to food banks in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Newark, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburg, Seattle, and Washington, DC.
