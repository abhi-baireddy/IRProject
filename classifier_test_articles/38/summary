Dear reader:How can anybody think or write about politics at a time like this?
This oft-heard question reflects an underlying belief that politics is a dirty business and not to be considered during a crisis.
Politics is also how we are getting a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency relief package through Congress.
Of course, there are distasteful aspects to politics – the name-calling, the dishonesty, the trickery.
But ultimately, at a time of crisis, it makes sense for Americans to put partisanship aside and hope that President Trump, as the nation’s chief executive, makes wise decisions.
