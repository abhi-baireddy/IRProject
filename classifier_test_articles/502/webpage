In his opening statement, Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings acknowledged that Cohen &#x201C;repeatedly lied in the past,&#x201D; calling it an &#x201C;important factor we need to weigh.&#x201D; He said if Cohen doesn&#x2019;t tell the truth, he&#x2019;ll refer him to the Justice Department for prosecution.</p><p>But Cummings said the hearing is important for understanding the president&#x2019;s past actions, saying &#x201C;the days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over.&#x201D;</p><p>Jordan, the ranking member on the committee, ripped Democrats for calling Cohen to testify, accusing Democrats of holding the hearing so they can later try to impeach the president.</p><p>&#x201C;The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,&#x201D; Jordan said.</p><p>Cohen admitted telling falsities in the past, but said he was coming clean: &quot;I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.&quot; He said he would not ask for or accept a pardon from Trump.</p><p>Among other claims, Cohen on Wednesday pointed to&#xA0;an &quot;unusual&quot; episode in Trump Tower in approximately June 2016, when Donald Trump, Jr. supposedly whispered about a &quot;meeting&quot; in Trump&apos;s ear -- followed allegedly by Trump&apos;s reply, &quot;Ok, good. Let me know.&quot;</p><p>According to Cohen, &quot;nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump&#x2019;s knowledge and approval.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lindsey-graham-slams-dems-for-hitting-new-low-for-holding-cohen-hearing-during-trumps-north-korea-summit" target="_blank"><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM SLAMS DEMS FOR HITTING &apos;NEW LOW&apos; BY HOLDING COHEN HEARING DURING TRUMP&apos;S NORTH KOREA SUMMIT</strong></a></p><p>&#x201C;So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad&#x2019;s desk that day,&quot; he said.</p><p>That meeting has long been a subject of contention, with participants supposedly promised dirt on Clinton, despite subsequent claims that the meeting dealt instead with other topics.&#xA0;Trump has maintained that he did not know in advance about the meeting -- backing up Trump Jr., who told the Senate Judiciary Committee the same thing in September 2017 and would face potential criminal liability if he were lying.</p><p>Cohen outlined a slew of other alleged misdeeds by Trump, including lying about his total assets to reduce his taxes and even trying to strong-arm academic officials into keeping his SAT scores and grades secret. And he repeatedly accused Trump of racism.</p><div originalImageUrl="https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/02/27/694940094001_6007828436001_6007830874001-vs.jpg" class="embed-media fn-video"><div class="video-container"><div data-widget-type="embed" data-video-id="6007830874001" data-video-domain="foxnews" class="m video-player" style="width:100%;height:100%;"><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/6007830874001"><img src="https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/02/27/694940094001_6007828436001_6007830874001-vs.jpg" alt="Cohen hearing opens with fireworks as Republicans move to postpone testimony"><span class="overlay">Video</span></a></div></div></div><p>&#x201C;While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way,&#x201D; Cohen said. &#x201C;And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.&#x201D;</p><p>Early Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Cohen was &quot;lying in order to reduce his prison time,&quot; and referred to published reports that Cohen had been disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court. The president was tweeting from Hanoi, Vietnam -- where he is attending a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p><p>As the hearing began Wednesday,&#xA0;Meadows interrupted to say Cohen&#x2019;s prepared testimony was not received by the committee 24 hours in advance in violation of committee rules, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-try-to-derail-michael-cohen-hearing-over-late-release-of-testimony-evidence" target="_blank">calling for a postponement of the hearing.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-try-to-derail-michael-cohen-hearing-over-late-release-of-testimony-evidence" target="_blank"><strong>REPUBLICANS TRY TO DERAIL MICHAEL COHEN HEARING OVER LATE RELEASE OF TESTIMONY, EVIDENCE</strong></a></p><p>&quot;It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisers to once again show his disdain for this body,&quot; Meadows said. Cummings admitted the committee received the testimony &#x201C;late last night.&#x201D; The Democratic-controlled committee voted to reject the GOP call to postpone.</p><p>Cohen, under questioning from Republicans, admitted he spoke with Democratic leaders in Congress, including Cummings and Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, before his testimony.</p><p>As for his future, Cohen would not rule out making money on a book or movie deal or as a paid television commentator. He said he would not rule out running for office in New York one day.</p><p>Wednesday&#x2019;s hearing is one of three congressional hearings this week where Cohen is expected to testify against his former boss. He testified Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and on Thursday, Cohen appears before the House Intelligence Committee &#x2013; though both are behind closed doors.</p><p>Trump&#x2019;s presidential campaign blasted Cohen in a statement Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>&#x201C;Michael Cohen is a felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer, who lied to both Congress and the Special Counsel in a &#x2018;deliberate and premeditated&#x2019; fashion according to the special counsel&#x2019;s office,&#x201D; press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. &#x201C;Now he offers what he says is evidence, but the only support for that is his own testimony, which has proven before to be worthless.&#x201D;</p><p>Cohen was originally scheduled to report to jail on March 6 to begin serving a three-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance and other violations last year. He is now scheduled to report to jail May 6.</p><p>In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of a deal. The charges against Cohen arose from two separate investigations &#x2013; one by federal prosecutors in New York, and the other by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p><em>Fox News&#x2019; Lillian LeCroy, Frank Miles, Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!----></div><div class="article-meta"><div class="author-bio">Alex Pappas is a senior politics editor at FoxNews.com. </div></div><footer class="article-footer"><!----><!----><div data-uid="ar-2" class="vendor-unit tablet-desktop"></div><div data-uid="ar-3" class="vendor-unit tablet-desktop"></div><div data-uid="ar-1" class="vendor-unit mobile"></div><div class="vendor-unit vendor-yieldmo"><div class="ad-container mobile-tablet yieldmo"><div id="cu_article_4" class="ad cu"></div></div></div><div class="vendor-unit vendor-yieldmo"><div id="cu_article_3" class="ad-container yieldmo"></div></div><div data-uid="ar-8" class="vendor-unit tablet-desktop"></div><!----><!----><div id="commenting" class="article-comments"></div></footer></div><aside class="sidebar sidebar-article sidebar-primary desktop"><div class="sticky-region"><div class="sidebar-columns"><div class="ad-container desktop"><div data-ad-pos="desktop" data-ad-size="300x250,300x600" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt "></div><span class="advert-txt"></span></div><div class="embed-media advanced">    <div class="content">
