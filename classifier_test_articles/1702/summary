Scientists who make big claims can be seen as capitalizing on media hype, and the rest of us sometimes blame the media itself for playing a part.
Hype in science can be seen as an outgrowth of the larger crisis in journalism, as the precipitous decline in journalism jobs has meant that few news outlets employ dedicated science journalists.
Outlandish claims are, in some sense, a luxury concentrated in the hands of those who already possess other luxuries — a kind of academic weight whose heft accumulates with time.
Most people are interested for the same reason scientists are: It came from outside the solar system!
Moreover, outlandish ideas are not demons, called into being by someone voicing their name — we should neither fear them, nor give them more power than they’re due.
