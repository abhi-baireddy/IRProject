President Trump said he is giving Washington state, California and New York “maximum flexibility” to use the National Guard as they see fit to combat the coronavirus.
Mr. Trump said he’s sending “federal medical stations” to hard-hit states with thousands of beds to handle patients, and he’s empowered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build medical facilities in New York.
Mr. Trump is striking an upbeat tone as the U.S. caseload reaches nearly 33,000, including 400 deaths.
“You will see our economy skyrocket once this is over,” Mr. Trump said.
“He’s been a great friend of mine,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Paul.
