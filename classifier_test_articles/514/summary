Zambian President Edgar Chagwa Lungu waits to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 25, 2018 in New York.
BRYAN R. SMITH/Getty ImagesThe United States recalled its ambassador to Zambia this week after the American diplomat’s extraordinary criticism of the southern African country’s record on corruption and gay rights rankled the Zambian leadership.
“Discriminatory and homophobic laws, under the false flags of Christianity and culture, continue to kill innocent Zambians, many of whom were born with the virus,” Foote’s statement read.
Lungu also hit back against the American diplomat’s comments on a state-owned television channel Sunday.
“The department said that his remarks were ‘the equivalent of a declaration that the ambassador is persona non grata.’”
