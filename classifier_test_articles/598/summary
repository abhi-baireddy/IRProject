The Saudis fly American Apache and Black Hawk helicopters into Yemen from military bases in Saudi Arabia, as well as the French AS-532 Cougar.
But the French report suggests that U.S. drones may also be helping with Saudi munitions targeting.
And both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have used French warships to enforce the coalition blockade against the country.
The report is primarily concerned with the location of French weapons among coalition forces and says nothing about origin of Houthi weapons, some of which are known to have come from Iran.
Despite their vast technological superiority, the Saudis in particular are failing to meet their military objectives, the report says, identifying Saudi targeting as in need of improvement.
