In this case, Ross lied to Congress, saying the Justice Department wanted the citizenship question added to help enforce the Voting Rights Act — a claim three lower courts dismissed as pretextual.
In fact, emails showed that Ross (with White House encouragement) was the one who pushed for the citizenship question and quietly dragooned the Justice Department into asking for the question to be added.
ADFor decades, the decennial census sent to each household hasn’t included a citizenship question (it’s instead asked on surveys), and for good reason.
More disturbing were their counterfactual theories claiming some other, unknown variable might cause Latinos not to answer the census.
(No such notions appeared in the case record, and census experts had already controlled for other variables.)
