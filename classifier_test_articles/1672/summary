ADADThe announcement Tuesday of Pell’s conviction in December came after a media gag order was lifted by prosecutors, who dropped separate sexual assault charges against Pell.
That allowed Australian media to officially report Pell’s conviction.
Even Australian media outlets obliged to follow the gag order found ways to indirectly get the message across.
Australia and Britain are among only a few countries where judges also are able to suppress reporting by issuing gag orders.
A British committee of judges ruled in 2011 that gag orders were used too frequently.
