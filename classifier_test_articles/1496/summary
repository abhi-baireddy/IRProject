Several states have already filed lawsuits to prevent there from being a citizenship question on the 2020 census, and the ACLU is firmly against including the question.
The ACLU decided to make its argument against the question in the form of an “elevator pitch,” or a discussion no longer than the time it takes to ride an elevator.
