Several states have already filed lawsuits to prevent there from being a citizenship question on the 2020 census, and the ACLU is firmly against including the question. The ACLU decided to make its argument against the question in the form of an “elevator pitch,” or a discussion no longer than the time it takes to ride an elevator.

We watched the video, but now we really want that question on there. They say correctly that the census is used to decide how many representatives a state gets, and then estimate that 6.5 million people won’t fill out the census if the citizenship question is on there — more people than the population of Tennessee. We’re not that hot on an imaginary 16th largest state being represented in Congress.

Is it bad that we don’t think non-citizens should count toward the number of representatives a state gets? California certainly wants those representatives, not to mention federal funds for social services.

We're headed to the Supreme Court next week to protect the 2020 census. Here's everything that's wrong with the citizenship question — in the time it takes for @ikebarinholtz to ride an elevator: pic.twitter.com/GPfzpesEqP — ACLU (@ACLU) April 17, 2019

Cute video. Slowest elevator ever. — Outward Rant (@outward_rant) April 17, 2019

Do you mean the attorney who is the Director of the Voting Rights Project? — Marite Rodriguez (@MariteRodz) April 17, 2019

Yes, that douchebag. Thanks — Peter Venkman (@mr_mojo112978) April 17, 2019

Nothing wrong with asking a question that has been asked on numerous censuses in the past. — NotMe 🇺🇸 (@redcardphreek) April 17, 2019

It is if we know it means we will get inaccurate data. — Marite Rodriguez (@MariteRodz) April 17, 2019

If you get inaccurate data, it’s because non-citizens didn’t fill out the “No” box and send the thing back. Maybe put the effort into encouraging even non-citizens to fill the thing out and return it.

I don’t know how a census to get demographics of “citizens” is wrong by asking first if you are indeed a “citizen”. Always fighting for illegals it seems to me! — Brian (@geohpman) April 17, 2019

Yet it was perfectly okay when it was on the 2000 one? #LiberalHypocrisy — PatrioticOne65 (@DepravedAngel) April 17, 2019

Out of curiosity, did you have to take the previous admin to court this frequently? — fresha vocado (@KellyMo80410780) April 17, 2019

Not over the census — the Obama administration removed the question from the 2010 census. Wonder why?

So you’re admitting that it’s strictly a partisan issue for you all? I’m pleasantly surprised by your honesty. — CMB (@cmbrva) April 17, 2019

What does the "A" in ACLU stand for? — NACLU – Non American Civil Liberties Union (@85percentweare) April 17, 2019
