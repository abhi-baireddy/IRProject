A Philadelphia nonprofit’s plan to open a safe injection site doesn’t violate federal drug laws, a judge ruled today, bringing the country’s first site for medically supervised heroin consumption one step closer to reality.
And, McHugh noted, there’s no evidence that lawmakers considered safe injection sites when writing the statute, since they weren’t popular then.
Last August, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued in an op-ed for The New York Times that safe injection sites would destroy neighborhoods like Kensington.
But those efforts—including a plan to authorize safe injection sites in California—have been chilled by warnings of legal action from the Trump administration.
