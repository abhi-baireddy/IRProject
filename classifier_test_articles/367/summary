Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden both falsely claimed during Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate that they are not receiving help from super PACs and outside groups.
"I don't have nineâ€”I don't have any super PACs," Sanders said.
Biden said Sanders's implication that he is aided by outside money and funded by wealthy donors is a farce.
Like super PACs, they are not bound by contribution limits and can collect unlimited sums from donors.
Johnny Verhovek, a political reporter for ABC, pointed out to Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield that these groups are not super PACs.
