Impossible Foods creates plant-based alternatives to meat.
You can buy Impossible products at Dunkin Donuts, White Castle, Burger King, Whole Foods, Qdoba, Red Robin, and other restaurants.
Konrad says Impossible Foods creates new products based on their potential environmental and public health impacts.
Impossible Foods isolated the protein from soybeans and developed a genetic engineering process to manufacture it in bulk.
