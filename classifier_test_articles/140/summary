The nation has moved in history as a result of Donald Trump’s personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen’s testimony.
Chair of the House Intelligence committee Representative Adam Schiff (D-NY) helped the country open its eyes to the dysfunctional severity of Trump running this great land.
Cohen testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about POTUS and Russia behind closed doors.
The Intelligence committee chair raised the shade of Trump’s presidency onto a stark window of reality.
He said that if Cohen’s testimony was accurate, Trump “literally committed crimes in the Oval Office.”CNN’s Alysin Camerota interviewed Schiff about Cohen’s testimony.
