“The idea that we’re strictly preaching to the converted is not true,” said Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.
“We look at the 2016 map and we intend to win where the president won the last time and we also think that we can expand the map and attract new voters and new supporters in states across the country,” Mr. Murtaugh said.
He also said voters across ideological lines agree with Mr. Trump’s argument on immigration that the law should be enforced.
“Democrats make a mistake where they can just shout the word immigration and think they win the argument with Hispanic voters,” he said.
Notwithstanding Mr. Trump’s advisers, Democrats and independent analysts said the president seemed to be gambling that he could win the same way again.
