In December 2015, Venezuelans expressed their disgust with Maduro by electing the opposition to take over the National Assembly.
“You have an elected national assembly being ignored.”The assembly passed laws restricting Maduro’s authority.
Like Maduro, Trump accused the opposition of voter fraud, obstructionism, and trying to impeach him.
Like Maduro, Trump claimed that he had to assume unilateral authority because his country faced a fictional “invasion.” Like Maduro, Trump ignored precedents that had previously limited the assertion of emergency powers.
“This is a national emergency,” agreed Kinzinger.
