The numbers are stark: New York’s top school, Stuyvesant High School, admitted just seven black students for a freshman class of 895.
The Bronx High School of Science had similarly dismal numbers: 12 offers for black students out of a class of 803.
Black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city’s public school system, which has roughly 600 schools.
