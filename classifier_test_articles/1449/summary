Activists are vowing to fight back after the Tennessee House of Representatives advanced a bill Monday that would impose fines on voter registration organizations that turn in incomplete forms.
Additionally, the legislation would require the groups to submit voter registration forms within 10 days and would also prohibit poll watchers from out of state.
“Everyone was all hands on deck,” Tequila Johnson, statewide manager of the Tennessee Black Voter Project, told ThinkProgress Tuesday.
The legislation comes after the Tennessee Black Voter Project sued Shelby County along with the Memphis NAACP last year.
[They] should be celebrating when there are multiple voter registration drives in both urban and rural settings,” Weinberg said.
