Circuit Court Appeals expressed skepticism about claims in a lawsuit that alleges Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.
Judge Dennis Shedd pressed her about whether anything short of divestment would resolve concerns about Trump violating the emoluments clause.
They say that even if Frosh and Racine did have standing to sue, their claims are invalid because the president has not violated the emoluments clause.
Mooppan said the plaintiffs are arguing that theyâ€™ve suffered injuries from competition when the emoluments clause was meant as a check against government corruption.
Two other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause have been filed in other federal courts.
