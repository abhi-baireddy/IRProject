Washington, DC (CNN Business) The National Security Agency recently alerted Microsoft to a major flaw in its Windows operating system that could let hackers pose as legitimate software companies, agency officials said on Tuesday.
Jeff Jones, a senior director at Microsoft, declined to discuss specifics of the flaw "to prevent unnecessary risk to customers."
The Department of Homeland Security said on the call that it would issue a bulletin to federal agencies advising them to install the Microsoft patches immediately.
The flaw concerns a core Windows function that verifies the legitimacy of apps and programs, a feature known as CryptoAPI.
By compromising that validation feature, hackers could easily impersonate "good" software companies to install bad software, Soltani said, potentially allowing them to spy on computer users or hold their devices hostage for ransom.
