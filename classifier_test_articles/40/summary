Last week, speculation abounded that newly appointed Attorney General William Barr was preparing to release special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as soon as this week.
“If anyone in Trump world is breathing easy right now, I’d say they are very foolish,” said Shanlon Wu, who previously defended former Trump campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates.
“Even if Mueller’s report were to appear and didn’t implicate the president, all these other criminal investigations will continue.
But in fact, the Mueller probe is just a small portion of the legal jeopardy surrounding Trump’s presidency.
The endgame of the Mueller investigation is important.
