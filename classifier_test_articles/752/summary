House Passes Resolution To Block Trump's National Emergency DeclarationEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Democratic-led House approved by a 245-182 vote a resolution on Tuesday that would terminate President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border â€” a declaration he made to allow him to access funds to build a wall without congressional consent.
The White House asserts that the president has the legal authority to declare a national emergency and to redirect existing federal funds to address that emergency.
Soon after, the president declared a national emergency to redirect more than $6 billion to build additional barrier.
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters that Congress will not be able to block Trump's emergency declaration.
A coalition of 16 states has filed suit against the Trump administration to try to block his emergency declaration.
