Special Counsel Robert Mueller included a mysterious note in a court filing Tuesday that suggests his team is busily working on a project that will soon be over.
Mueller’s team was supposed to respond to this legal motion by Thursday, March 21.
But instead, Mueller requested in a new filing that the deadline be extended to April 1; he said that the Post’s attorneys had not objected to the adjustment.
There are no imminent deadlines in Roger Stone’s case, or the two appeals from a Stone associate and a mystery company.
If the Mueller team is putting its final touches on its report, that may effectively close the investigations surrounding Manafort, and thus obviate the need to seal much of the information regarding his case in the court records.
