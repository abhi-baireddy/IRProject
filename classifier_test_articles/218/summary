Idaho is facing a pair of lawsuits after its governor signed two of the nationâ€™s harshest anti-transgender bills into law.
It really just shows trans folks in Idaho that we're not welcome here.
Of the estimated 60 anti-trans bills under consideration by state legislatures in 2020, 12 are still active.
According to Lambda Legal, HB 509 is currently unenforceable because of the aforementioned 2018 federal court ruling.
The government will have until July 1 to do so, which is when the new law is scheduled to take effect.
