The Islamic State officially claimed responsibility for Friday’s terror attack in London.
Attacker Usman Khan — who recently was released from prison after serving six years for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange — was acting in its name, the terror group said.
Khan “carried out the attack in response to calls to target the nationals of Coalition countries,” the ISIS statement said.
Two people were stabbed to death and several others injured before police shot Khan dead on the London Bridge.
According to Ms. Callimachi, the ISIS statement does not say Khan was directly dispatched by the group, but, she maintained, this is a distinction without a difference.
