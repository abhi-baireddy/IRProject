ARUNDEL, Maine (Reuters) - For Maine dairy farmer Fred Stone, the discovery in 2016 that his cows were producing tainted milk has since brought financial ruin and threatened to shut down a century-old family business.
Alan Bjerga, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, said that his organization believed the Stoneridge case to be an isolated event.
But Maine public health officials said in 2017 that milk with PFOS exceeding 210 parts per trillion should be considered “adulterated” and banned from sale.
So far, this ban has only affected Stoneridge, whose milk had levels as high as 1,420 parts per trillion.
Last year, test results on his farm’s milk came back clean, and he was allowed to sell milk to Oakhurst again.
