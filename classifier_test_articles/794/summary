President Donald Trump made a number of eyebrow-raising claims during Wednesday’s address to the nation on the latest tensions in the Middle East — but perhaps none more so than his assertion that the U.S. had destroyed “100 percent of ISIS.”Near the end of his 10-minute address from the White House, responding to Iran’s missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq, Trump claimed the U.S. had destroyed “100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate” in Iraq and Syria.
“The territorial caliphate has been defeated, but the group is still very much active,” Henman told VICE News.
That doesn’t mean ISIS is“It hasn’t given up the idea of a territorial caliphate,” said Henman.
Last year alone, ISIS claimed responsibility for mass casualty attacks in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.
“Whether the U.S. will make the same mistake of taking its foot off the group’s neck again remains to be seen,” said Henman.
