Don’t look too closely at the Fed’s “dot plot” or you might miss the larger monetary policy picture.
Collateral confusion: This is not the first time that a Fed chair has provided Fed watchers with an art class on interpreting the Fed’s dot-based pictures of monetary policy.
A suggestion: We are not fans of the dot plot.
We think that a data-dependent approach is the most sensible way to run monetary policy.
In any case, given that the dot plot hasn’t been spot-on in a very long time, we won’t be upset if the Fed deletes the dots in the future.
