House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan blasted Michael Cohen during the former Trump lawyer's explosive public hearing Wednesday, claiming Cohen turned on the president because he didn't land a job at the White House.
But Jordan suggested Cohen, who will soon report for a three-year prison sentence, only parted with Trump after he was excluded from the White House.
“How long did you work in the White House?” Jordan asked.
“I never worked in the White House,” Cohen replied.
You wanted to work in the White House, but you didn’t get brought to the dance,” Jordan said.
