(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley reported a 9 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but managed to beat analyst estimates through slight growth in its wealth management business, as well as cost cuts.

Morgan Stanley gets about half its annual revenue from wealth management, which helps it ride out weak periods for trading and investment banking.
Both of those businesses suffered during the first quarter at Morgan Stanley and its Wall Street rivals because of subdued volatility.
Morgan Stanleyâ€™s wealth management profit margin and its return on equity of 13.1 percent were comfortably within the targeted range Chief Executive James Gorman has set.
