Organizers of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., are being accused of anti-trans bias after two siblings allege they were denied the use of their preferred restrooms there.
Navi and Juice were waiting in separate lines for the bathrooms (Husky for the women's room, Juice for the men's) and claim no one around them voiced opposition.
“Coachella is part of the pop culture zeitgeist,” Navi told the Los Angeles Times.
Navi emailed Coachella staff but never received a response, prompting her to reach out to attorneys.
The stance of Coachella is complicated by its parent company and its owner, Philip Anschutz.
