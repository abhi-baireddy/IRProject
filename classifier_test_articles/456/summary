But in the context of both what Shopko once was and what retailing overall has become, it is nothing short of tragic.
In its heyday, which wasn’t all that long ago, Shopko was as good a discount merchant as existed anywhere in retailing.
Shopko also made a smart move by staking its claim on the pharmacy and optical business as cornerstones of its strategy.
The stores went down-market, making them much more a direct competitor to Walmart—never a good position in modern American retailing.
So while the memory of Shopko will fade—probably fairly quickly—the significance of how and why it happened should serve as a benchmark moment for American retailing.
