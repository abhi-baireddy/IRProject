New science out of Harvard University found that the more soda people drink, the higher their risk of dying from heart disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer.
The researchers found that people who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages, including soda, were associated with risk of death from heart disease.
Compared to people who infrequently drank soda, the people who drank more than two servings a day had a 31% higher risk of death from bad heart health.
Each serving-per-day increase in soda consumption was associated with a 10% higher risk of heart disease-related death, the study states.
The research will likely add more fuel to the efforts of health advocates to get people to drink less soda.
