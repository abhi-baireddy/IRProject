The campus of Yale University in 2012 (Michelle McLoughlin/Reuters)Higher-ed institutions have long ignored merit and squelched freedom, all while failing to educate.

What a strange psychological mechanism: Wealthy white liberals apparently squared the circle of their own private and insider privilege by fobbing “white privilege” off on those who don’t have it — as they used their privilege cynically for their own children.
Yet once politics serves as such a blanket exemption for institutions, then it’s no surprise that the institutions ignore or even normalize fraud, racial and class discrimination, and consumer misinformation.
The rationale of contemporary higher education is that such progressive angels surely cannot be self-interested devils.
