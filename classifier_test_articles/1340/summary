What happens when the LGBT community collides with the Muslim community in the UK?
The Muslim schools did not want the LGBT lessons.
Books now being read by pupils at Parkfield Community School include Mommy, Mama and Me and King & King – stories about same-sex relationships and marriages.
It’s a Muslim community.
Some parents at Parkfield, and the other four schools, claim the classes are inappropriate for young children and the schools’ LGBT message contradicts Islam.
