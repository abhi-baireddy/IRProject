7, the antiwar Yemen resolution passed by both houses of Congress earlier this year:President Trump has just issued the second veto of his presidency, rejecting a resolution from Congress to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.
Withdrawing U.S. support from the Saudi coalition endangers no Americans, and it is another one of his scurrilous lies for Trump to say so.
With a veto, they lose faith in the United States and see the end to their suffering a little further out of reach.
Today Trump has proven once more to the people of Yemen just how cynical he and the other supporters of the war are.
Support for the war on Yemen is the most disgraceful U.S. policy today, and it is one of the most despicable policies of the last fifty years.
