That’s not to say no one still believes in a fully independent Palestinian state. Dovish members of the shrinking Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party still believe in the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and seem to be in favor of a Palestinian state with more control of its own borders. The Arab parties, too, want a fully independent Palestine. But Labor and Meretz are unlikely to win more than a few seats in the Knesset, and no Israeli party with the realistic ambition to be the ruling party is likely to cooperate with the Arab parties.

Kahol Lavan has not yet announced a platform, but here is what we can guess about its positions: It will demand that Jerusalem stay united under Israel’s jurisdiction; it would keep the main settlement blocs in place; it will oppose a unilateral evacuation of settlements; it will want Israel’s eastern border, in the Jordan Valley, to remain under Israel’s control. And most important, it will likely demand that the Israeli Army has the right to operate in all of the territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.

When the Palestinians envision their future, they envision a real state. When Israel’s center-left envisions the future, it envisions an entity in which the Palestinians have autonomy and one in which they can exercise their national self-determination, with the following caveat: Israel retains the right to operate militarily in this area and Israel controls all of its borders.

In fact, what Mr. Gantz and the center-left now offer the Palestinians is very similar to what they might get from Mr. Netanyahu who once called it a “state minus.” Even Naftali Bennett, the leader of the even more right-wing party, New Right once agreed to “autonomy plus,” a formulation that is different more in tone than in substance.

Of course, there still might be a real difference between the center-left and the right. Maybe Mr. Gantz seriously means what he says, while Mr. Netanyahu is just playing for time. Or maybe Mr. Gantz will change his tune once he is elected and decide to withdraw unilaterally from the West Bank, or accept a different deal from the one he is now supporting, as has happened with previous prime ministers.
