We just celebrated Veterans Day, paying tribute to the young men and women who have served our country.
Even the Greatest Generation that fought in World War II suffers current suicide rates four times that of civilians.
More than 30 times a day, VCL responders call police, fire or EMS to intervene in a suicide situation.
Risking lives constantly in endless wars is a moral violation and strategic failure.
The best tribute to our combat veterans would be to create fewer of them in the future.
