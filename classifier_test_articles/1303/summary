THE INTERVENTION on March 18th by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, could almost have been scripted to make the Brexit process even more tortuous.
Without warning the government, Mr Bercow ruled that Downing Street could not put Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which has already twice been rejected by large majorities, to a third vote unless it was changed in substance.
Mr Bercow, who has occupied the canopied chair for nearly ten years, is unpopular with most Tories, who believe he is a Remainer bent on sabotaging Brexit.
The real obstacle to passing the deal is not Mr Bercow but Mrs May’s inability to talk enough MPs round to supporting it.
And that, not the antics of the Speaker, is what is really blocking her Brexit deal.
