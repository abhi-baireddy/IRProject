In November, Prince Andrew stepped back from public duties "for the foreseeable future" over the "disruption" of his association with the late Epstein.
"He publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators."
Despite a pledge to comply, Prince Andrew has provided "zero" cooperation with the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry, New York prosecutors said.
"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein," Prince Andrew said in a statement.
In a November interview with the BBC, Prince Andrew claimed Giuffre's account was false because she described him as sweating on a dance floor.
