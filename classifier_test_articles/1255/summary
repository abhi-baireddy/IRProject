The anti-LGBTQ former judge may make another U.S. Senate run — and a plurality of Republican voters would choose him.
Prominent homophobe Roy Moore, who’s threatening to run for U.S. senator from Alabama again, leads other potential Republican candidates in a new poll.
State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent.
Byrne is the only Republican who has formally declared his candidacy so far, but Moore has said he is thinking about another Senate run.
“Jones might not beat a traditional Republican candidate in 2020 — but Democrats know that he has already beaten Roy Moore once.”
