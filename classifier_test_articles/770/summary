(Wolfgang Rattay/REUTERS)Teenage Green New Dealers, like some of the Parkland survivors, aren’t interested in debate or democracy.
Dianne Feinstein was confronted in her San Francisco office by a group of students who demanded that she vote for the Green New Deal.
The teenagers had zero interest in Feinstein’s arguments about how bills get passed and the art of the possible.
But while interest in public issues is a good thing, the kind of activism practiced by the Sunrise Movement, Thunberg, or the Parkland kids is not one in which the democratic process or the notion of give and take has any place.
Like the Sunrise Movement kids, she has no patience for any discussion about the havoc that might result were her absolutist views put into action.
