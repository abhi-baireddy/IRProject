(CNN) The White House missed a House Judiciary Committee deadline to turn over scores of records as part of a sweeping Democratic-led investigation into whether President Donald Trump abused his power in office, according to a source familiar with the situation.

In all, Republican aides said the committee had received responses from eight of the 81 officials who received letters from the committee earlier this month, and a ninth had mailed documents, though they had yet to be received.

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler had set a Monday deadline asking for an array of documents -- including over the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, internal discussions about the decision of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia probe, details about any talks to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller as well as records about payments Trump made as part of a hush-money scheme to keep his alleged extramarital affairs from going public.

The source told CNN that the White House has not yet responded, though it intends to in the near future.
