(CNN) The White House missed a House Judiciary Committee deadline to turn over scores of records as part of a sweeping Democratic-led investigation into whether President Donald Trump abused his power in office, according to a source familiar with the situation.
And some former White House officials who received letters from the committee requesting documents, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson, are referring the inquiries to the White House.
In all, Republican aides said the committee had received responses from eight of the 81 officials who received letters from the committee earlier this month, and a ninth had mailed documents, though they had yet to be received.
But Democrats said more recipients had agreed to provide documents to the panel.
The source told CNN that the White House has not yet responded, though it intends to in the near future.
