It is not clear whether Barker intentionally left her child in the car.
He avoided charges after he told authorities that he did not know Barker’s child was in the car.
“Every time I close my eyes, I picture her suffering, and then I picture her laying in this coffin,” Hyer said Monday, the AP reported.
Child protective services took temporary custody of her, and Baker was suspended for a week without pay over the incident, the AP reported.
He is suing the Long Beach Police Department and the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services in a wrongful-death suit, the AP reported.
