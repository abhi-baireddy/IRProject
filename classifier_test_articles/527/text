An Arkansas woman has been convicted of fatally shooting her husband last summer for his refusal to quit porn.

Patricia Hill, 69, was found guilty on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the July fatal shooting of her husband, Frank Hill, at their Pine Bluff home, about 40 miles southeast of Little Rock.

Hill was infuriated that her husband had repeatedly subscribed to a porn channel on their Dish Network, despite her protests, Hillâ€™s attorney said in court Monday.

According to testimony, Patricia Hill had previously canceled the pornography channel but shot her husband twice after seeing a bill that showed the channel had been added again.

The jury found Patricia Hill guilty Tuesday in Pine Bluff after she testified that she wasn't thinking when she killed her husband. She said she didn't know that shooting at his feet could kill him as he bent over. She said she only meant for the shooting to get his attention.
