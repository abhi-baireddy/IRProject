The recent blip toward economic slowdown — which assured the Federal Reserve doesn’t raise interest rates this week — won’t last.
75% chance the Fed is on holdCME FedWatch says futures prices project 75% odds that Fed won’t raise rates through December.
Or, maybe not — if the Fed is steely enough to wait for inflation to begin rising tangibly past the central bank’s 2% annual target before raising rates.
