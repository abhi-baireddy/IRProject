The deadly attack at Columbine High School in 1999 seemed to usher in a new era of school shootings.
In the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, some research suggests that gun violence is a near-daily experience at schools.
In contrast, over the past eight years, an average of about six fatal school shootings happened each year, with about 14 killed.
One school shooting he cites happened in 1989, when a gunman killed five elementary school students and wounded 32.
In more recent years, most school shootings are either related to perceived bullying or to reasons that cannot be definitively explained.
