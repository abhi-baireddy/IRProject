Hollywood got a deeper, first-person look inside the abortion industry Monday night during the premier of the film “Unplanned.”The film is based on the true story of Planned Parenthood director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson.
The premier concluded with a standing ovation.
Johnson, who spoke at the premier, tweeted a photo of her attending with her husband and oldest daughter:At the red carpet premiere of @UnplannedMovie!!!
