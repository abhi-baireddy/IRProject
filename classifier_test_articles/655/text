Hollywood got a deeper, first-person look inside the abortion industry Monday night during the premier of the film ‚ÄúUnplanned.‚Äù

The film is based on the true story of Planned Parenthood director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson. It comes out in theaters nation-wide on March 29.

Attendees described a packed theater Monday at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles where celebrities like singer Joy Villa, pro-life leaders including Lila Rose and Johnson herself, and conservative entrepreneur Mike Lindell had the opportunity to watch the film for the first time.

Some said they were moved to tears by the film as it depicted Johnson‚Äôs struggles through two abortions, her work at Planned Parenthood and her decision to leave and become pro-life.

The premier concluded with a standing ovation.

Johnson, who spoke at the premier, tweeted a photo of her attending with her husband and oldest daughter:
