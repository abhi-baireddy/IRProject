Mr. Biden once described Mr. Hollings as his best friend in the Senate.
That friendship is what first brought Mr. Biden to South Carolina, where Mr. Hollings would introduce him to many of his political allies.
Eventually, Mr. Biden began vacationing in the state, usually staying on one of the barrier islands near Mr. Hollingsâ€™s native Charleston.
The relationships Mr. Biden developed here now form the nucleus of his support network in the first-in-the-South primary state.
Those connections were on vivid display as the former vice president stood before hundreds of mourners in the cadet chapel.
