Russia hoaxer Shep Smith shuts down Notre Dame fire speculation on his showFox News host Shepard Smith made waves Monday afternoon when he immediately cut off a French media analyst and former elected official who came on his show in the wake of the fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral.
“Sir, sir, sir, we’re not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don’t know,” Smith interjected.
For the past few years, Smith has regularly peddled Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theories on his Fox News show.
“President Trump declined to stand up for his own people and instead embraced Vladimir Putin,” Smith added.
Smith has never apologized for promulgating the debunked Russia collusion hoax since the beginning of the Trump presidency.
