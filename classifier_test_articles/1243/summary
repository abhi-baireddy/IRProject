NEW YORK (AP) — The apparent suspension of Jeanine Pirro is squeezing Fox News Channel in two directions.
A prominent Muslim-American civil rights organization is calling for advertisers to boycott Fox News, while another group is petitioning to have the weekend host reinstated.
Pirro wasn’t on the air Saturday, a week after Fox publicly condemned her for comments questioning U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s loyalty because she wears a Muslim head covering.
Meanwhile, the lobbying group Act for America urged its members write to Fox News President Suzanne Scott to complain about Pirro’s absence.
Between the suspension of Pirro and hiring of Brazile, “if that doesn’t show you the direction Fox News is headed I don’t know what will,” she tweeted.
