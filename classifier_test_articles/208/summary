Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat,” Rep. Matt Gaetz tweeted as Cohen testified behind closed doors.

Matt GaetzWASHINGTON — A Republican member of Congress and close ally of President Donald Trump accused Michael Cohen of infidelity on Tuesday, raising questions about witness intimidation as Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer testifies before Congress this week.
Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about when discussions related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal ended.
On Thursday, Cohen will appear privately before the House Intelligence Committee, which — like its Senate counterpart — is investigating Russian election meddling.
Democrats have already accused Trump of trying to intimidate Cohen before his testimony to Congress.
