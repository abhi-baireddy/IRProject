On Fox News Thursday in discussion with Sean Hannity, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) made an extraordinary statement: That he wants the United States to “cancel” some of the national debt held by the Chinese government as punishment for allowing the coronavirus to spread beyond its borders.
But it might go even further than that — some have interpreted the phrase “shall not be questioned” more literally, to mean that public officials are bound not to say anything that would make creditors “question” the validity of the public debt.
If that is the case, then Graham would have violated the Constitution simply by saying he wants debt held by China to be canceled.
Either way, far from the “bipartisan pushback” Graham is predicting, his idea will go nowhere.
