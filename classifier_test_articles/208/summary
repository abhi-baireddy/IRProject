The Pentagon Papers Case is a profound explication of one of the great values underlying the freedom of speech; namely, the government cannot lawfully punish those who publish truths it hates and fears.
Regrettably, the Trump administration is pretending the Pentagon Papers Case does not exist.
For them, there is no escaping the Pentagon Papers Case.
Might all of this be part of the Trump administration's efforts to chill the free speech of its press critics â€” to deny them breathing room?
Yet the whole purpose of the First Amendment is to assure open, wide, robust debate about the government, free from government interference and threats.
