Until watching this video I never realized that my carelessness with the boarding pass had the potential to land me in a ton of trouble!
Evidently there is personal information frequently encrypted on the pass, according to ‘Krebs on Security”.
All that an unscrupulous person has to do is get a screen shot of the bar code on the boarding pass, and feed it into a bar code reader on “Inlite’s” site.
I never would have dreamed that being careless with my boarding pass could lead to such potential damage.
