The language on anti-Semitism in an Iowa bill was never intended as a basis for legislation, and its adoption elsewhere has stifled free speech.

From swastika-adorned vandalism on Iowa campuses to mass shootings, anti-Semitism is a growing and deadly threat. But a bill before the Iowa House is the wrong way to combat it, and it threatens to stifle free speech.

The bill, House File 2303, would require state entities to employ the controversial 2016 Working Definition of Antisemitism of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or IHRA, in reviewing any possible “violation of law, rule, or policy regarding discriminatory acts.” It echoes a recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump that focused on campus anti-Semitism.

The IHRA does important work. It assists member nations in preserving historical sites and records, for example. It funds research in understudied areas, like the Nazi genocide of the Roma people and the mass murder of the disabled, and much more.

The IHRA’s “working definition of antisemitism,” however, was never intended to be legally binding. The organization developed the definition as a tool for member states to track incidents of anti-Semitism. It was to serve as an aid in data collection: nothing more, nothing less.

But don’t take my word for it: Ask the principal author of the definition, Kenneth Stern. Now the director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, Stern has sharply criticized governments’ use of the definition in legalistic frameworks.

The IHRA’s working definition of anti-Semitism is an inadequate basis for legislation for two reasons. First, it is vague. It begins: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews.” It leaves open the question of what those “certain perceptions” are.

The most concerning aspects of the definition, however, are the examples appended to help officials identify expressions of anti-Semitism. Seven of the 11 examples concern criticism of the state of Israel.

Criticism of Israel can certainly overlap with anti-Semitism, and when it does, it must be called out. Such disproportionate focus on Israel, however, creates a presumption that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. Those who can’t afford to defend against a lawsuit would sensibly avoid any speech critical of Israel — which potentially includes all support for Palestinian rights. As Stern says, “It sets up a system in which administrators have a reason to either condemn or try to suppress pro-Palestinian speech because their job is to keep the university from being sued.”

The focus on Israel also distracts from other expressions of anti-Semitism. The recent wave of anti-Semitic acts in this country has not come from supporters of the Palestinian cause. The acts have come from white supremacists and individuals radicalized by other, less prevalent, hate-based ideologies. Yet as Stern notes, there’s no equivalent definition of anti-black racism, with examples, that has the force of law. “If you were to craft one,” he asks, “would you include opposition to affirmative action? Opposing removal of Confederate statues?”

To penalize such opinion would clearly violate free speech. But Stern points to the most promising way to combat anti-Semitism: Take unified action against all forms of identity-based oppression.

The IHRA working definition does contain a caveat: “Antisemitism does not include criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country.” But that word “similar” is too open to interpretation. Is criticism of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories anti-Semitic? Similar criticism isn’t leveled against any other country — because no other country engages in this practice.

Experience shows how easily legalistic use of the IHRA definition can lead to overreaching, defeating the very purpose of building a more just world. In Britain, which has adopted the definition, a charity event for Palestinian children was canceled out of concern that it might be seen as breaching the IHRA framework. Here at home, universities have been threatened with defunding because of scholarly events seeking a better understanding of the Middle East.

The IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism was never intended as a basis for legislation, and its adoption elsewhere has stifled free speech. The Iowa House should reject this bill.
