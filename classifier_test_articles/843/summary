Oregon is poised to become the first state in the nation to impose statewide limits on how much landlords can raise rents after state lawmakers passed a sweeping measure on Tuesday.
The legislation would generally limit rent increases to 7 percent annually plus the change in the Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation.
The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 35 to 25, largely along party lines.
The measureâ€™s passage comes as states and cities across the country have struggled to address a growing housing affordability crisis.
Rents have risen while wages have stagnated, and the supply of affordable housing has fallen short of need.
