I am a little surprised that people have been surprised by the rough patch Joe Biden has hit in the past few weeks.
All the while, there’s a nostalgic appeal to a Biden presidency: His folksy ways feel like a tonic, an assurance that things can return to “normal.” A President Joe Biden, the thinking seems to go, would reduce President Donald Trump to a bad dream.
In my experience, early frontrunners like Biden face a battle against attrition.
But it’s not impossible that the Joe Biden I know could be the one to navigate these waters.
But there is something of real value at the core of Joe Biden that cannot be denied.
