Moore and Cain can't ruin the Fed, because the Fed has been a failure for years.
Traditional Fed nominees themselves are equally elite.
Putting Trump's nominees on the Fed Board would not lead the Fed down the path of partisanship â€” it is already too far gone.
The desire to stick with traditional Fed picks would certainly rule out hacks like Moore and Cain.
That Trump's latest Fed picks would dispense with the norm of "traditional" nominees is probably the one positive thing that can be said for them.
