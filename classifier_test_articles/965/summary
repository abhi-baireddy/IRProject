The Daily Beast reports that “working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.”Take action now to demand Congress stop Trump from firing Special Prosecutor Mueller!
The GRU, or General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate in English, is the Russian military’s intelligence agency.
This is obviously a monumental development that is the first concrete link between the Trump campaign, by way of campaign adviser Roger Stone, to the hacked emails from Wikileaks, to agents of the Russian Federation.
Not a Russian aluminum magnate, not an Azerbaijani pop star, not some ex-con real estate thug, nor a Belorussian sex worker, but a member of the Russian military establishment who takes orders directly from President Vladimir Putin.
