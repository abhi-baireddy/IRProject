Cost remains a central problem for universal health care, although there is little agreement about how much such plans would cost overall.
Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation said Wednesday that it’s important to keep an eye on the different components within the health care system when considering costs: “When you talk about the cost of Medicare-for-all, it’s important to be clear about whose cost you’re talking about -- the overall health care system, consumers and patients, or the federal government,” Levitt tweeted Wednesday.
Whatever the final cost, a universal health care system would necessarily involve a substantial increase in taxes as the government-run health care system turns to individuals and companies to cover the entire bill for health care, which currently comes in at $3.7 trillion overall, with private insurers picking up much of the tab.
In the best case scenario, overall health care spending falls to less than 14% of the economy.
