The poll also finds enthusiasm about voting next year already outpaces the level seen for any presidential contest since the turn of this century.
Three-quarters (76%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the party ought to nominate Trump in 2020, a figure that has held roughly steady for the last year.
Asked the same about Biden, 51% say the party has a better shot with Biden than without him.
The poll also finds Democrats and Republicans have completely different issue priorities when thinking about next year's election.
On the Democratic side, they're weighing a candidate's personal attributes, immigration, the economy and health care all about evenly.
