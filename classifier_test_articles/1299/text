Popular rapper Snoop Dogg and other black entertainers expressed outrage over comments Fox News host Laura Ingraham made about the funeral of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved rapper and community leader in Los Angeles, California.

Ingraham pointed out that Hussle recorded an expletive-ridden protest song against President Donald Trump, and went on to ridicule at the lyrics of the song.

Hussle, whose real name is Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was shot and killed outside of his store in South Los Angeles in March. His massive funeral was attended by many celebrities and leaders of the African-American community in celebration of his artistic contributions and political activism.

Rapper "The Game" called Ingraham a "disrespectful c***" and called on his 10.3 million followers on Instagram to demand she be fired by putting pressure on her advertisers.

"I'm asking all of my followers, fans, friends & family to spread this video with demands of #LauraIngrahams termination immediately !!!!!" he commented.

Snoop Dogg added simply, "I'm in."

Video of Ingraham's comments were also circulated on Twitter.

Rapper T.I. posted a video of Ingraham's comments and excoriated her reaction on his Instagram account.



"This is Disgusting! You both are vile despicable, poor excuses for people," he commented. "Neither of you WILL EVER know or experience the level of love, appreciation and respect that Nip has... EVEN IN DEATH!!! So let that sizzle in ya lil hateful,demonic spirits."

Actress Nia Long commented on his post, saying, "Both need to be fired. PERIOD!!"

A petition with more than 40,000 signatures is being circulated for the purpose of terminating Ingraham from Fox News over the comments she made.

Four people were shot during the funeral procession for Hussle through Watts, and one later died.
