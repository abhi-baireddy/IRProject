It’s the view of a top national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Trump and Kim are in Hanoi to discuss how to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program.
“It’s a good deal for North Korea and a bad deal for the United States,” he said during a Tuesday speaking engagement at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington.
For all the incentives the US might give North Korea, “the US can get much more than that,” he said.
It’s unclear as of now if the South Korean president agrees or disagrees with his aide, though.
