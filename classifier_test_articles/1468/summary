The plaintiffs have sued Monsanto claiming to have contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) after being exposed to Roundup, the company’s glyphosate-based herbicide.
While there are an estimated 9,300 lawsuits against the chemical giant because of Roundup, Hardeman will be only the second NHL trial against Monsanto ever.
Judge Vince Chhabria has already granted an unusual motion by Monsanto to split the Hardeman trial into two phases.
In the Johnson trial, Monsanto objected to multiple attempts by the plaintiff to admit evidence.
Monsanto is now pointing to the Hardeman bifurcation to convince a Superior Court judge in Oakland, California, to bifurcate a similar lawsuit , Pilliod v. Monsanto.
