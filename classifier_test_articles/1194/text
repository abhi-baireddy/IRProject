President Donald Trump is again going after the late Republican Senator from Arizona, John McCain.

Trump spoke to reporters about McCain's deciding "no" vote on the repeal of Obamacare, effectively ending the President's push to undo one of former President Barack Obama's foremost achievements.

He continued:

"I think that's disgraceful. Plus there are other things, I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be."

Trump's latest attack is part of an ongoing feud with the McCain family,

Days earlier, the President—who reportedly went to great efforts to conceal his high school and college transcripts—chastised the late McCain as "last in his class" on Twitter.

McCain's daughter Meghan didn't hold back in her response.

Twitter is roasting the President for his latest comments.

They weren't done.

Many were mystified that the President is still holding a grudge against McCain nearly seven months after his death.

The President initially failed to lower the White House flag until days after McCain's death. He was also famously not invited to the Senator's funeral, which was attended by every living former President.
