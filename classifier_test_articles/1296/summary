CNN received a prestigious journalism award for a televised town hall event after the Parkland, Florida, massacre that was really a gun control advocacy event at which conservatives were berated and verbally abused, according to Hot Air.
The event was not remotely journalistic in nature; instead, it was set up to scapegoat conservatives Rubio and Loesch as having contributed to the tragedy by way of their views on gun rights.
Still, the University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center awarded CNN the "Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism," even though the event itself was titled, "The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action."
"I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough event," Loesch tweeted.
"The lengths @CNNPR went to inflame emotions and exploit pain to *put on a show* is inexcusable, shameful, and it's grotesque they're celebrating getting an 'award' for their conduct."
