House Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to require 11 states and dozens of counties with recent histories of voter discrimination to receive approval from the federal government before making any changes to their election laws.
The Voting Rights Advancement Act is a move to repair the Voting Rights Act of 1965, part of which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.
The new list is slightly shorter than the one had the bill become law last year when 13 states were predicted to be covered.
But Democrats said that court ruling gave states more leeway to pass even more restrictive voting laws.
"Speaker Pelosi’s massive, new federal takeover of the way states and communities run their elections — contains no effort whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting," McConnell said.
