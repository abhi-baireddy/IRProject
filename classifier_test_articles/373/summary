Prince Harry and a heavily-pregnant Meghan visited New Zealand House in London this afternoon to pay their respects to the 50 people massacred as they prayed at two mosques on Friday.
Harry said 'it's just very sad' as he asked about their connections to Christchurch.
'Their Royal Highness's visit is reflective of this outpouring of support and it was wonderful to welcome them to New Zealand House.'
The duke and duchess are among the first to sign the book of condolence, which opened to the public on Tuesday.
On Saturday, Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch charged with one count of murder and was remanded until April 5.
