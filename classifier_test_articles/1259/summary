The United States Postal Service (USPS) faces no shortage of issues, from billions of dollars in annual financiallosses to declining consumer service marks.
But by saying “no” to a terrible, lopsided agreement, the Postal Service has set a welcome precedent that other agencies could stand to follow.
In 2017, the Capitol Forum used barcode scanning technology to decode the postage prices that Stamps.com was offering small postage buyers.
All of this duplication and unsustainable pricing meant that record profits accrued by Stamps.com resulted in record losses for the Postal Service.
In fact, it was the Postal Service that had jettisoned the agreement, which for them had been all pain and no gain.
