Ivanka Trump on Wednesday confirmed that Trump's nepotistic quest to install his family members into key government positions goes further than originally thought.
Of course, Ivanka Trump has few qualifications to be leader of the World Bank, which provides low-interest loans to developing countries and advises those countries on how to invest their funds.
Ivanka Trump has made some much-publicized efforts to help women in developing countries while serving in her father's administration.
That time, Ivanka Trump refused to comment on whether her dad ever offered her the UN ambassador job, telling the Associated Press that she was going to "keep that between" them.
But now that Ivanka Trump has admitted that her dad did in fact offer her a key role in the Trump administration, we can add yet another entry to Trump's list of likely crimes.
