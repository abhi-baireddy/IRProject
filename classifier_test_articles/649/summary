But whatever your political party, the latest antics from President Trump, during a global pandemic which has killed more than 25,000 Americans, seal the deal: We need out of this mess for good.
On a practical level, we could be in better shape today had another administration been better equipped to deal with this pandemic.
There is no excuse for Trump’s shadow war on experts at a time when we need them most.
Trump has tried to bully the states either into doing what he wants or praising his response.
And his latest exercise in despotism — “When somebody’s president of the United States, the authority is total” — was a disaster.
