Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke likened his service in Congress to contributions to charity on Tuesday when responding to a critic of his low charitable giving.
A town hall questioner at the University of Virgina asked O'Rourke why her sister, a recent college graduate, made far less than he did but gave more to charity.
"I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, my state and now, of my country.
O'Rourke added there were some charities they donated to which they hadn't recorded and itemized to write off on their taxes.
O'Rourke said in 2018 he would not be a candidate but he ultimately reversed himself and joined the increasingly crowded field of 2020 hopefuls.
