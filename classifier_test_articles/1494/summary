It seems like only yesterday when Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was slamming Donald Trump for his “dangerous rhetoric” in the wake of his tweet regarding Ilhan Omar’s 9/11 remarks.
But Trump's dangerous rhetoric against @IlhanMN is disgusting.
“We’re gonna punch Trump in the face!” she tells me, smiling broadly, literally jumping up and down.
