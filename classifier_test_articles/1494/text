It seems like only yesterday when Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was slamming Donald Trump for his “dangerous rhetoric” in the wake of his tweet regarding Ilhan Omar’s 9/11 remarks. Actually, it was four days ago:

As a Senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can't accept any minimizing of that pain. But Trump's dangerous rhetoric against @IlhanMN is disgusting. It’s a false choice to suggest we can’t fight terrorism and reject Islamophobic hate at once—a president should do both. — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 13, 2019

Well anyway, the woman who’s hoping to replace Donald Trump in the White House seems to have undergone a change of heart with regard to “dangerous rhetoric.” At least when she’s the person who’s spouting it:

Joan Walsh writes in the Nation:

The morning after her packed event in Davenport, I follow Gillibrand south to Muscatine—she is on a Mississippi River tour, visiting some of the Iowa counties that flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016—and she seeks me out to make sure I’ll be at her official campaign kickoff that coming Sunday, outside of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York. “We’re gonna punch Trump in the face!” she tells me, smiling broadly, literally jumping up and down. “It’s the New York way!” Then she hops in her car to race to her next event.

Should “a president” be talking like that, Kirsten?

You’re not inciting violence, are you? 🤔 — Jen Edwards (@Jennife25485619) April 17, 2019

She's going to get someone killed with that rhetoric lol — Steven (@brother_steve) April 17, 2019

This feels like incitement — Mauty480 (@Mauty480) April 17, 2019

Is that incitement? Certainly seems like incitement. — Annais Bond (@AnnaisBond) April 17, 2019

INCITEMENT!! INCITEMENT!! — Andrew Maynes (@UtahGunGuy) April 17, 2019

Wow @SenGillibrand is out there inciting violence. 😬 — Stop The Insanity! (@Sanity_Only) April 17, 2019

Why is @SenGillibrand inciting violence? So reckless…. — varyar (@varyarpol) April 17, 2019

Gillibrand must be held accountable for inciting violence. — Chris Raab (@ChrisRaab3) April 17, 2019

OMG!! Did she just put the POTUS's life in danger? Incitement! — GWHOG (@GWHOG) April 17, 2019

Perhaps Ilhan Omar’s army of defenders can spare a few men to sic on Kirsten Gillibrand for this incendiary language. How can Joan Walsh stand for something like this?!

So incitement is only bad for the other guy…. https://t.co/EWqL6R5C2c — EducatëdHillbilly™ (@RobProvince) April 17, 2019

So it’s ok if @SenGillibrand incites violence?!? — Steve Dziemian (@SfDz11_07_14) April 17, 2019

Oh, haven’t you heard? It’s totally fine when liberals do it.
