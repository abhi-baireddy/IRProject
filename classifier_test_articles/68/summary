(AP) — The elite academies that educate officers for the nation’s armed forces have begun to implement the Trump administration’s ban on transgender service members.
The Defense Department confirmed that change to the Capital Gazette newspaper on Monday.
The American Medical Association has blasted the administration’s transgender policy for military service.
An organization that represents transgender service members said several are attending each academy, although many haven’t come out.
The Air Force Academy will conform with Defense Department policy when admitting future cadets, said Lt. Col. Tracy Bunko, an academy spokeswoman.
