“America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open,” Trump said at the White House during the daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing.
Asked by The Post if states that already meet the preliminary criteria, such as Montana and Utah, could reopen immediately, Trump confirmed that they would.
Earlier Thursday, concerned governors had cautioned Trump against reopening too quickly, telling him they were still experiencing critical coronavirus test shortages.
Trump promised to ramp up manufacturing of these testing elements, saying 5.1 million more swabs would be delivered to states by the end of the month.
Trump’s announcement came as seven Northeastern states on Thursday extended their shutdown until May 15 to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
