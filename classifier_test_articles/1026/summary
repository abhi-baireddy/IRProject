SALT LAKE CITY — Elizabeth Warren is headed to Utah on Wednesday after promising to restore broader public lands protections for two of the state’s high-profile national monuments if elected president.
Warren’s plan is part of a broader energy proposal that puts her among the few Democratic candidates talking about public lands, a hot topic in the region.
Utah voters, though, are divided on shrinking Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half, said Jason Perry with the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah.
Other elements of Warren’s plan, like a ban on new fossil fuel leasing on public lands and free entry to national parks, could also spark debate.
“It’ll be interesting to see where this goes inside the party as well as the national race.”WATCH: What a broad, bipartisan public lands bill means for the American wilderness
