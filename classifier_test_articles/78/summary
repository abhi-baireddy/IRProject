The new Chrysler plant would be the first since 1991 and is expected to add 3,850 jobs.
The company said in a news release that it would add another 1,100 new jobs at its Jefferson North Assembly plant in Detroit, and roughly 1,500 new jobs at facilities in the neighboring suburb of Warren.
Fiat Chrysler said the additional investments are subject to tax incentive packages it was working out with the city and state of Michigan.
