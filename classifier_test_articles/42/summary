Having become true-believers themselves, Evangelical leaders have offered themselves up as trusted messengers for this New-and-Improved political gospel project.
When I outlined evangelicalism’s brand problem in early 2016, few of us had any idea how bad it could get.
In the aftermath of Moore’s campaign and (merciful) defeat, the minority of Evangelical Christians who found him horrifying are doing some public soul searching—well, except not really.
Many recognize only the brand problem and are, more than anything, simply scrambling to get away from the term evangelical itself.
People trust religious leaders to be honest and moral, and when that is gone little influence remains.
