President Trump vetoed a bill Tuesday aimed at ending U.S. involvement in Yemen.
The four-year civil war in Yemen has led to what the U.N. calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with millions in danger of starving.
Tens of thousands have died in the conflict between the coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi rebel forces, backed by Iran.
Neither tally would be enough to overturn the veto, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers.
Trump vetoed in March legislation that would have ended the national emergency he declared at the southern border.
