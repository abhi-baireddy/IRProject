OK, let’s assume that something deserving the name “U.S.-China trade deal” has been reached — even one dubbed “Phase One” or “preliminary.” Deep doubts would remain justified about whether it can possibly serve American interests.

China’s economy obviously has taken a much greater trade war hit than America’s — of course mainly because it’s so much more trade-dependent.
In short, this is no time for Trump to reach any deal with China — whatever phase it’s called.
