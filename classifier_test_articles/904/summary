SAN ANTONIO — Julián Castro, in a baseball cap and zip-up hoodie, sipped an iced tea and considered how he could win the Democratic presidential nomination.
“If everybody would just get out of the way,” he said on a recent afternoon, “I’d have a clear path.”He was only half-kidding.
Mr. Castro is in need of a breakthrough moment.
While he has many fans in his hometown, San Antonio, where he once served as mayor, he is not well known on the national stage.
And with the sudden rise of the former El Paso congressman Beto O’Rourke, Mr. Castro is not even the most well-known candidate in his own state.
