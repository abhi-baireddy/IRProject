But there was one thing about giving birth during the covid-19 pandemic that I didn’t anticipate: how I would become scared of, and also scared for, my health-care providers.
The ward was filled with women seeking to deliver before the hospital went over capacity with covid-19 cases, and they were short-staffed.
Covid-19 is forcing a change in the provider-patient relationship and creating a tension that must be navigated with empathy, by caregivers and patients alike.
Perhaps what is needed are wards or entire hospitals that can be reliably separated to care for patients with covid-19 and those without.
Patients and providers inhabit a new normal in which we worry about — and for — each other.
