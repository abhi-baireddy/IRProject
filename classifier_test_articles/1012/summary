Now, it’s members of the transgender community who are being punished for who they are by banning them from the Military.
I served in the United States Army for over thirteen years.
Only around one percent of people in the United States join the military, and we are at a time we can’t afford to lose more people just because of hate.
Leaders need to think about the aftermath of banning or kicking out transgender soldiers, because many had it in mind to make the military a twenty year career with no back up plan.
We need to get involved with Congress and demand a stop to this ban, because it will do more harm than good.
