Making “hurricanes with machines” may sound like something from a science fiction movie, but engineering storms through artificial weather modification are nothing new.
Government-funded programs such as the High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was created in the early 1990s and was an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
HAARP was capable of “weaponizing” the weather and has the ability of potentially triggering floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes.
Throughout the life of the program, it had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs.
