Fox, headed by Rupert Murdoch, is best known for providing right-leaning news and political talk shows, like Justice Jeanine and Hannity.
Progressive congresswomen from Rashida Tlaib or Ilhan Omar to Katie Porter and Kate Hill born the brunt of attacks, each in their own ways and for their own reasons.
The assaults on Ilhan Omar have been particularly dangerous and gross.
There isn’t a single persuadable voter in the electorate who might vote for Democrats if they abandon Ilhan Omar, but they will vote Republican if Democrats defend her.
The best way to counter Fox News’s obsession with AOC and her allies is to elect a lot more like her at all levels of government.
