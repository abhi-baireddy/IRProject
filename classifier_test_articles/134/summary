Mr Trump described the resolution as an "unnecessary" and "dangerous" attempt to weaken his constitutional powers.
It is only the second time Mr Trump has used his presidential veto since he took office in 2017.
Opposition in Congress to his policy on Yemen grew last year after Saudi agents killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
The House Speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was among those to condemn President Trump for the move.
