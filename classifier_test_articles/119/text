Pete Buttigieg has openly discussed his sexuality before and during his presidential campaign, but was confronted by a protestor for defending marriage equality at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa on Tuesday, per the AP.

Details: As Buttigieg talked about marriage equality, the protester stood up and shouted: “You betray your baptism!” before being removed from the town hall. Per the AP, Buttigieg — whose presidential run is historic as the first openly gay candidate in a same-sex marriage — took the interruption with a light-hearted approach, saying: “Coffee after church gets a little rowdy sometimes.”

““We’re so dug-in, in such passionate ways, and I respect that, too. That gentleman believes that what he is doing is in line with the will of the creator. I’d do it differently. We ought to be able to do it differently.

"There are a lot of positions, there’s a wide range, with fringes, in our politics. That’s part of how politics works, and you shouldn’t be in this if you aren’t prepared to deal with that."
