Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may not have Hillary Clinton to contend with in this Democratic nomination process, but he’s not about to let Clinton allies who are still active in the Democratic Party jump on the bandwagon of his success.
Over the weekend, Mediaite reports, Sanders’ campaign “fired off an angry letter to [the] liberal think tank” Center for American Progress, now run by a longtime Clinton fan, Neera Tanden.
It’s also not directly affiliated with Think Progress, CAP claims, which they consider an “editorially independent” outlet under the umbrella of the 501(c)(4) but not directly related to it.
Center for American Progress is a generous donor to both progressive and moderate Democratic campaigns as well as to left-leaning PACs and organizations.
But more likely, Bernie Sanders’ war with former Clinton allies is strategic.
