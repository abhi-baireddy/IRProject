Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) deleted tweets this week containing some of her publicly anti-Semitic comments after having apologized for her words but not her views.
In early February, Omar made a series of ill-advised tweets concerning Jewish Americans, the state of Israel, and the United States government.
In reply, Omar claimed elected officials acted for Israel out of financial interest.

Since the uproar, Omar has deleted tweets, but not publicly changed any of her views on Jews or the Jewish state.
