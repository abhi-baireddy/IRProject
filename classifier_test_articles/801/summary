The White House announced Tuesday that President Trump has chosen former Delta Air Lines exec Steve Dickson as the new head of the Federal Aviation Administration.
The nomination came as the FAA was facing sharp questions over its handling of a new type of Boeing jetliner that suffered two deadly crashes in less than five months.
Trump plans to nominate Dickson, who was in charge of flight operations at Delta, to the five-year term, the White House said.
The FAA was criticized for waiting days before grounding Boeing’s 737 Max 8 after an Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month.
After more than 40 other countries grounded the flights, including NATO members, the agency said it detected “clear similarities” between that flight and a fatal crash in Indonesia in October.
