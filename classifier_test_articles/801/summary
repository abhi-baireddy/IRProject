Sales made prior to Thanksgiving and Black Friday could erode “the spike that we have seen in sales dollars historically,” Bitar said.
The condensed shopping season this year accelerated early promotions and spending.
While store traffic still remains an important indicator, a lot of shopping during Thanksgiving and Black Friday now happens online.
Adobe Analytics, which measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers, estimates $7.5 billion in sales for Black Friday online, a growth of over 20.5% year-over-year.
ET on Thanksgiving Day, shoppers had spent $2.1 billion online, up 20.2% on a year ago.
