If you want to make a joke about Devin Nunes’ new lawsuit against Twitter (and some Twitter users) where else would you make those jokes, except on the social platform itself? The California Republican must have known when he filed this lawsuit that it would backfire and actually result in a lot more criticism of the Congressman. The Washington Post writes:

Nunes is suing @DevinCow, along with another parody account called @DevinNunesMom, Republican strategist Liz Mair and Twitter as an organization, alleging a concerted effort to defame him and work against his 2018 reelection campaign. He’s also accusing Twitter of unfairly targeting conservatives through a practice known as “shadow banning.” He’s asking for $250 million. What might be most notable about Nunes’s suit is that this is the first battle he chose. Nunes said on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show Monday night that this is “the first of many” lawsuits to come. Does he really think his most obvious and airtight case involved … @DevinCow and @DevinNunesMom?

Not surprising it looks like Nunes may not have had access to the cream of the crop when it comes to attorneys who would take this lawsuit.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit does have one big fan. And if you want to draw even more attention to the Twitter accounts in question, there is no better supporter than the President himself. Donald Trump and Devin Nunes always seem to have each other’s backs.

While the @DevinNunesMom account has been suspended, the @DevinCow account has gone from 1000 to 135,000 followers in just one day (and it’s still growing). The lawsuit also reportedly sparked countless other Nunes parody accounts.

Here’s some reaction from the Twittersphere.
