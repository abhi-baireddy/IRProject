Trump calls for new nuclear deal while bashing old one with misinformation It's unlikely that Iran, or the other world powers, would agree to negotiations.
Instead, Trump urged those countries that remain in the deal to pursue negotiations over a new Iran nuclear deal.
President Donald Trump leaves after speaking about the situation with Iran in the Grand Foyer of the White House in Washington, Jan. 8, 2020.
They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -- or JCPOA -- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place."
While Trump expressed optimism for a new negotiation with Iran and a new deal, the chances of that are also low.
