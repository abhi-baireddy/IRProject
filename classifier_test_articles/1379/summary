Two weeks earlier, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador had announced that Mexico’s war against narcotrafficking was over.
Amaya Ordorika, who advocates for sensible drug policy and the end of the drug war with the nonprofit group ReverdeSer Colectivo, says the new plan could be a step towards repairing some of the harm of the drug war.
Washington has invested up to $3 billion in Mexico’s drug war through the Mérida Initiative, a bilateral agreement made in 2007.
Concurrent with the increased funding to the drug war, though, homicides and other violent crimes have only increased.
The end of the drug war would mean the United States could choose to withhold aid, Ordorika says.
