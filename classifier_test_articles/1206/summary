Trump tried to hire a black friend for half a million dollars.
According to rapper and actor 50 Cent (real name: Curtis Jackson), Trump offered him $500,000 to appear at his poorly attended inauguration.
50 Cent told the story during an appearance Tuesday on CBS' "The Late Late Show," sitting next to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
