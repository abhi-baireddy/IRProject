As House Democrats vote Tuesday to stop President Trump’s emergency declaration on the southern border, congressional Republicans should ask themselves: Why is it that every other president is permitted by courts to exercise “executive discretion,” and yet Trump isn’t?
It’s every bit of a crisis today as it was when former President Barack Obama called it that in 2014, and the media happily played along.
Trump’s official declaration only means he’s using his last option to address the issue.
This is a choice about relinquishing authority to Democrats to set immigration policy even while a Republican president is in office.
Now Trump’s emergency declaration is, as everyone knew it would be, tangled up in court.
