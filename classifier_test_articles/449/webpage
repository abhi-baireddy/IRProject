				<p id="speakable-summary">As the U.S. and much of the world hunkers down to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, some virus-related conspiracy theories are having a heyday. Specifically, a conspiratorial false claim that 5G technology is linked to COVID-19 gained ground, accelerating from obscurity into the rattled mainstream by way of conspiracy theorists who&#8217;d been chattering about 5G conspiracies for years.</p>
<p>While there is scientific consensus around the basic medical realities of COVID-19, researchers are still filling in the gaps on a virus that no one knew existed five months ago. That relative dearth of information opens the way for ideas usually relegated to the internet&#8217;s fringes to slip into the broader conversation about the pandemic — a dangerous feature of an unprecedented global health crisis.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.yonder-ai.com/">Yonder</a>, an AI company that monitors online conversations including disinformation, conspiracies that would normally remain in fringe groups are traveling to the mainstream faster during the epidemic.</p>
<p>A report on coronavirus misinformation from the company notes &#8220;the mainstream is unusually accepting of conspiratorial thinking, rumors, alarm, or panic&#8221; during uncertain times — a phenomenon that explains the movement of misinformation that we&#8217;re seeing now.</p>
<p>While the company estimates that it would normally take six to eight months for a &#8220;fringe narrative&#8221; to make its way from the edges of the internet into the mainstream, that interval looks like three to 14 days in the midst of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the current infodemic, we&#8217;ve seen conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation spread across the internet at an unprecedented velocity,&#8221; Yonder Chief Innovation Officer Ryan Fox told TechCrunch. He believes that the trend represents the outsized influence of &#8220;small groups of hyper passionate individuals&#8221; in driving misinformation, like the 5G claims.</p>
<p>While 5G claims about the coronavirus are new, 5G conspiracies are not. &#8220;5G misinformation from online factions like QAnon or Anti-Vaxxers has existed for months, but is accelerating into the mainstream much more rapidly due to its association with COVID-19,&#8221; Fox said.</p>

<p>The seed of the false 5G coronavirus claim may have been planted in a late January print interview with a Belgian doctor who suggested that 5G technology poses health dangers and might be linked to the virus, according to reporting from <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory">Wired</a>. Not long after the interview, Dutch-speaking anti-5G conspiracy theorists picked up on the theory and it spread through Facebook pages and YouTube channels already trafficking in other 5G conspiracies. Somewhere along the way, people started <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884jkb/people-in-the-uk-are-burning-5g-phone-towers-because-conspiracy-theorists-claim-they-spread-coronavirus">burning down</a> mobile phone towers in the U.K., acts that government officials believe have a link to the viral misinformation, even though they apparently took down the wrong towers. &#8220;Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment,&#8221; The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims">reported</a>.</p>
<p>This week, the conspiracy went mainstream, getting traction among a pocket of credulous celebrities, including actors <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-explained">John Cusack and Woody Harrelson</a>, who amplified the false 5G claims to their large followings on Twitter and Instagram, respectively.</p>
<p>A quick Twitter search reveals plenty of variations on the conspiracy still circulating. &#8220;&#8230; Can’t everyone see that 5G was first tested in Wuhan. It’s not a coincidence!,&#8221; one Twitter user claims. &#8220;5<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-vw2c0b r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">G</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> was first installed in </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-vw2c0b r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Wuhan</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> and now other major cities. Coincidence?,</span>&#8221; another asks.</p>
<p>In the past, 5G misinformation has had plenty of help. As The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html">reported</a> last year, Russian state-linked media outlet RT America began airing segments raising alarms about 5G and health back in 2018. By last May, RT America had aired seven different programs focused on unsubstantiated claims around 5G, including a report that 5G towers could cause nosebleeds, learning disabilities and even cancer in children. It&#8217;s possible that the current popular 5G hoax could be<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/covid-19-link-to-5g-technology-fueled-by-coordinated-effort"> connected to disinformation campaigns</a> as well, though we likely won&#8217;t learn the specifics for some time.</p>
<p>In previous research on 5G-related conspiracies, social analytics company Graphika found that the <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-health-risks-concerns">majority</a> of the online conversation around 5G focused on its health effects. Accounts sharing those kinds of conspiracies overlapped with accounts pushing anti-vaccine, flat Earth and chemtrail misinformation.</p>
<p>While the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory has taken off, it&#8217;s far from the only pandemic-related misinformation making the rounds online lately. From the earliest moments of the crisis, fake cures and preventative treatments offered scammers an opportunity to cash in. And even after social media companies announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">aggressive</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/">policies</a> cracking down on potentially deadly health misinformation, scams and conspiracies can still surface in AI blindspots. On YouTube, some scammers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-youtube-ads-ban-ai-covid-19-misinformation-moderation-google-2020-4">avoiding target words</a> like &#8220;coronavirus&#8221; that alert automated systems in order to sell products like a powdered supplement that its seller falsely claims can ward off the virus. With their human moderators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis/">sent home</a>, YouTube and other social platforms are relying on AI now more than ever.</p>
<p>Social networks likely enabled the early spread of much of the COVID-19 misinformation floating around the internet, but they don&#8217;t account for all of it. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all banned Infowars founder and prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from their platforms back in 2018, but on his own site, Jones is peddling false claims that products he sells can be used to prevent or treat COVID-19.</p>
<p>The claims are so dangerous that the FDA even <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/free-speech-systems-llc-dba-infowarscom-605802-04092020">stepped in this week</a>, issuing a warning letter to Jones telling him to cease the sale of those products. One Infowars video cited by the FDA instructs viewers concerned about the coronavirus &#8220;to go to the Infowars store, pick up a little bit of silver that really acts its way to boost your immune system and fight off infection.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it becomes clear that the disruptions to everyday life necessitated by the novel coronavirus are likely to be with us <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/coronavirus-distancing-new-normal">for some time</a>, coronavirus conspiracies and scams are likely to stick around too. A vaccine will eventually inoculate human populations against the devastating virus, but if <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-anti-vaxxers-pushed-mom-not-give-her-son-tamiflu-n1131936">history</a> is any indication, even that is likely to be the fodder for online conspiracists.</p>

Card?&#8221; TechCrunch has obtained imagery that shows Google is developing its own physical and virtual debit cards. The Google card and associated checking account will allow users to buy things with a card, mobile phone or online. It connects to a Google app with new features that let users easily monitor purchases, check their balance or lock their account. The card will be co-branded with different bank partners, including CITI and Stanford Federal Credit Union.<\/p>\n<p>A source provided TechCrunch with the images seen here, as well as proof that they came from Google. Another source confirmed that Google has recently worked on a payments card that its team hopes will become the foundation of its Google Pay app &#8212; and help it rival Apple Pay and the Apple Card. Currently, Google Pay only allows online and peer-to-peer payments by connecting a traditionally issued payment card. A &#8220;Google Pay Card&#8221; would vastly expand the app&#8217;s use cases, and Google&#8217;s potential as a fintech giant.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976410\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1004\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png 1650w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=150,147 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=300,294 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=768,753 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=680,667 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=1536,1506 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Debit-Card.png?resize=64,64 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2>Google the financial services company?<\/h2>\n<p>By building a smart debit card, Google has the opportunity to unlock new streams of revenue and data. It could potentially charge interchange fees on purchases made with the card or other checking account fees, and then split them with its banking partners. Depending on its privacy decisions, Google could use transaction data on what people buy to improve ad campaign measurement or even targeting. Brands might be willing to buy more Google ads if the tech giant can prove they drive a sales lift.<\/p>\n<p>The long-term implications are even greater. While once the industry joke was that every app eventually becomes a messaging app, more recently it&#8217;s been that every tech company eventually becomes a financial services company. A smart debit card and checking accounts could pave the way for Google offering banking, stock brokerage, financial advice or robo-advising, accounting, insurance or lending.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1976450\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1976450\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1976450\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png\" alt=\"Young wealthy man pays card using mobile payment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=300,159 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=768,408 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=680,361 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=1536,816 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=2048,1088 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GettyImages-1066818018.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1976450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> jossnatu \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s vast access to data could allow it to more accurately manage risk than traditional financial institutions. Its deep connection to consumers via apps, ads, search and the Android operating system gives it ample ways to promote and integrate financial services. With the COVID-19 downturn taking shape, high-margin finance products could help Google develop efficient revenue opportunities and build its share price back up.<\/p>\n<p>When TechCrunch asked Google for confirmation, it did not dispute our findings or assertions. The company offered us a statement it provided reporters following a November story, wherein Google told The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601\">Wall Street Journal&#8217;s<\/a> Peter Rudegeair and Liz Hoffman it was experimenting in the checking account space. TechCrunch is the first to report Google&#8217;s debit card plans:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We\u2019re exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools, while keeping their money in an FDIC or NCUA-insured account. Our lead partners today are Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union, and we look forward to sharing more details in the coming months.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For now, Google&#8217;s strategy is to let partnered banks and credit unions provide the underlying financial infrastructure and navigate regulation while it builds smarter interfaces and user experiences. It&#8217;s forseeable that one day Google might cut out the banks and take all the spoils for itself. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/12\/03\/google-wallet-cards-arriving-now-but-consumer-benefits-remain-unclear\/\">Google launched a Wallet debit card<\/a> in 2013 as an extension of its old payment app Google Wallet, but shut the card down in 2016. Given Google&#8217;s penchant for renaming or shutting down then reviving products, building a new debit card feels on-brand.<\/p>\n<p>With people around the world suddenly more concerned about their finances amidst the coronavirus economic disaster, a debit card with more transparency and controls could be appealing.<\/p>\n<h2>First look at the Google Card<\/h2>\n<p>Traditional banking products can be clunky, often requiring phone communication with customer service or sifting through cluttered websites to address security issues. Google hopes to make financial management as intuitive as its email and mapping apps. The card and app designs shown here are not final, and it&#8217;s unclear when Google&#8217;s debit card may launch. But let&#8217;s take a look at what these internal Google materials reveal about its ambitions for its payment instrument.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976421\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"812\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png 770w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png?resize=142,150 142w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png?resize=284,300 284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png?resize=768,810 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png?resize=645,680 645w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Pay-Card.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Google debit card will come co-branded with the Google name and its partnered bank, though the exact name of the product is still unknown. In the designs, it&#8217;s a chip card on the Visa network, though Google could potentially support other networks like Mastercard. Users are able to add money or transfer funds out of their account from the connected Google app, which is likely to be Google Pay, and use a fingerprint and PIN for account security.<\/p>\n<p>Once connected to their bank or credit union account, users could pay for purchases in retail stores with a physical Google debit card, including with contactless payments, by just holding it up to a card reader. A virtual version of the card that lives on a user&#8217;s phone can also be used for Bluetooth mobile payments. Meanwhile, a virtual card number can be used for online or in-app payments.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976423\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"824\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png 824w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png?resize=150,124 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png?resize=300,247 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png?resize=768,633 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png?resize=680,560 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Virtual-Card.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Users are shown a list of recent transactions, with each including the merchant name, date and price. They can dig into each transaction to see the location on a map, get directions or call the store. If users don&#8217;t recognize a transaction, it&#8217;s easy to protect themselves with the card&#8217;s vast security options.<\/p>\n<p>If a customer suspects foul play because they lost their card, they can lock it and optionally order a replacement while still being able to pay with their phone or online, thanks to Google&#8217;s virtual card number system that&#8217;s different than the one on their physical card. If instead they suspect their virtual card number was stolen by a hacker, they can quickly reset it. And if they believe someone has gained unauthorized access to their account, they can lock it entirely to block all types of payments and transfers.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976427\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png 2470w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=300,183 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=768,470 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=680,416 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=1536,939 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=2048,1252 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Google-Card-Privacy-Security.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The settings reveal options for notifications and privacy controls to &#8220;decide what information you share,&#8221; though we don&#8217;t have imagery of what&#8217;s contained in those menus.

Apple launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/28\/how-apple-card-works\/\">Apple Card<\/a> in August, offering a slickly designed titanium Mastercard credit card backed by Goldman Sachs. It charges minimal customer fees, comes with a virtual card for use through Apple Pay and generates interest.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1976412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1976412\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1976412 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=768,590 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=1536,1180 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=2048,1573 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Apple-Card.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1976412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple Card<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Apple does collect interchange fees from merchants, though, which Google could similarly gather to earn revenue.

It seems whenever companies help move people&#8217;s money around, some of it inevitably &#8220;falls off the truck&#8221; and lands in their pockets. Financial services are typically low-overhead ways to generate revenue. That could be especially enticing, as Google has found many of its side hustle &#8220;other bets&#8221; to be unsustainable. It&#8217;s moved to prune some of these tertiary projects, such as its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/18\/alphabet-takes-the-wind-out-of-its-makani-energy-kites\/\">Makani wind energy kites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google may never find businesses as lucrative as its core in search and advertising, but it has the advantages to become a serious player in fintech. Its vast sums of cash, deep bench of engineering talent, experience building complex utilities, numerous consumer touch points and near-bottomless well of data could give it an edge over stodgier old banks and scrappier startups. And while Facebook slams into regulatory scrutiny and is forced to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/16\/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns\/\">scale back its Libra cryptocurrency<\/a>, Google&#8217;s more familiar approach via debit cards could pay off.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>For more of this author Josh Constine\u2019s product analysis, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/joshconstine\">join his newsletter<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you pay with a &#8220;Google Card?&#8221; TechCrunch has obtained imagery that shows Google is developing its own physical and virtual debit cards.

Earlier this week, Trump claimed that a president has &#8220;total authority&#8221; to reopen the national economy, a sentiment that his tweets Friday appeared to undermine.<\/p>\n<p>Trump&#8217;s calls to action in support of state-based protests would also appear to potentially contradict both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Facebook&#8217;s new rules specific to the pandemic, which in both cases explicitly forbid any COVID-19 content that could result in the real-world spread of the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last month, Facebook and Twitter both rolled out relatively aggressive new policies designed to protect users from content contradicting the guidance of health experts, particularly anything that could result in real-world harm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update: <\/strong><em>According to a Twitter spokesperson, the president&#8217;s tweets do not currently violate Twitter&#8217;s rules. Twitter does not consider the tweets as worded a &#8220;clear call to action&#8221; that could pose a health risk. Twitter also did not determine that the tweets were shared with harmful intentions.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Facebook did not provide answers to questions about the protests organized on its platform by the time of publication.<\/p>\n<p>In late March, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/18\/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy\/\">updated its safety policy<\/a> to prohibit any tweets that &#8220;could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19.&#8221; The stance banned tweets claiming social distancing doesn&#8217;t work as well as anything with a &#8220;call to action&#8221; that could promote risky behaviors, like encouraging people to go out to a local bar.<\/p>\n<p>On April 1, Twitter again <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/company\/2020\/covid-19.html#protecting\">broadened its definition<\/a> for the kind of harmful COVID-19 content it forbids, stating that it would &#8220;continue to prioritize removing content when it has a clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people\u2019s health or well-being.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook similarly<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/03\/combating-covid-19-misinformation\/\">\u00a0expanded its platform rules<\/a> to match the existential health threat posed by the coronavirus. In guidance on its policies for the pandemic, Facebook says that it &#8220;remove[s] COVID-19 related misinformation that could contribute to imminent physical harm.&#8221; As an example, the company noted that in March it began removing &#8220;claims that physical distancing doesn\u2019t help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Social media companies signaled early in the U.S. spread of the coronavirus that they would take health misinformation \u2014 and the safety of their users \u2014 more seriously than ever.

PEPP-PT COVID-19 contacts tracing standard push could be squaring up for a fight with Apple and Google"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A coalition of EU scientists and technologists that&#8217;s developing what&#8217;s billed as a &#8220;privacy-preserving&#8221; standard for Bluetooth-based proximity tracking, as a proxy for COVID-19 infection risk, wants <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Google to make changes to an API they&#8217;re developing for the same overarching purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) uncloaked on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/an-eu-coalition-of-techies-is-backing-a-privacy-preserving-standard-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing\/\">April 1<\/a>, calling for developers of contact tracing apps to get behind a standardized approach to processing smartphone users&#8217; data to coordinate digital interventions across borders and shrink the risk of overly intrusive location-tracking tools gaining momentum as a result of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>PEPP-PT said today it has seven governments signed up to apply its approach to national apps, with a claimed pipeline of a further 40 in discussions about joining.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We now have a lot of governments interacting,&#8221; said PEPP-PT&#8217;s Hans-Christian Boos, speaking during a webinar for journalists. &#8220;Some governments are publicly declaring that their local applications will be built on top of the principles of PEPP-PT and also the various protocols supplied inside this initiative.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know of seven countries that have already committed to do this &#8212; and we&#8217;re currently in conversation with 40 countries that are in various states of onboarding.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Boos said a list of the governments would be shared with journalists, though at the time of writing we haven&#8217;t seen it. But we&#8217;ve asked PEPP-PT&#8217;s PR firm for the info and will update this report when we get it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The pan-European approach has worked,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Governments have decided at a speed previously unknown. But with 40 more countries in the queue of onboarding we definitely have outgrown just the European focus &#8212; and to us this shows that privacy as a model and as a discussion point&#8230; is a statement and it is something that we can export because we&#8217;re credible on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paolo de Rosa, the CTO at the Ministry of Innovation Technology and Digital Transformation for the Italian government, was also on the webinar &#8212; and confirmed its national app will be built on top of PEPP-PT.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will have an app soon and obviously it will be based on this model,&#8221; he said, offering no further details.<\/p>\n<p>PEPP-PT&#8217;s core &#8220;privacy-preserving&#8221; claim rests on the use of system architectures that do not require location data to be collected. Rather devices that come near each other would share pseudonymized IDs &#8212; which could later be used to send notifications to an individual if the system calculates an infection risk has occurred. An infected individual&#8217;s contacts would be uploaded at the point of diagnosis &#8212; allowing notifications to be sent to other devices with which had come into contact.<\/p>\n<p>Boos, a spokesman for and coordinator of PEPP-PT, told TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/eu-privacy-experts-push-a-decentralized-approach-to-covid-19-contacts-tracing\/\">earlier this month<\/a>\u00a0the project will support both centralized and decentralized approaches. The former meaning IDs are uploaded to a trusted server, such as one controlled by a health authority; the latter meaning IDs are held locally on devices, where the infection risk is also calculated &#8212; a backend server is only in the loop to relay info to devices.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just such a decentralized contacts tracing system that Apple and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> are collaborating on supporting &#8212; fast-following PEPP-PT <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/10\/apple-and-google-are-launching-a-joint-covid-19-tracing-tool\/\">last week<\/a> by announcing a plan for cross-platform COVID-19 contacts tracing via a forthcoming API and then a system-wide (opt-in) for Bluetooth-based proximity tracking.<\/p>\n<p>That intervention, by the only two smartphone platforms that matter when the ambition is mainstream adoption, is a major development &#8212; putting momentum behind decentralized contacts tracing for responding digitally to the coronavirus crisis in the Western world, certainly at the platform level.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/doceo\/document\/TA-9-2020-0054_EN.pdf\">resolution<\/a> passed today the European parliament also called for a decentralized approach to COVID-19 proximity tracking.<\/p>\n<p>MEPs are pushing for the Commission and Member States to be &#8220;fully transparent on the functioning of contact tracing apps, so that people can verify both the underlying protocol for security and privacy and check the code itself to see whether the application functions as the authorities are claiming.&#8221; (The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/08\/call-for-common-eu-approach-to-apps-and-data-to-fight-covid-19-and-protect-citizens-rights\/\">Commission has previously signaled a preference for decentralization<\/a> too.)<\/p>\n<p>However, backers of PEPP-PT, which include at least seven governments (and the claim of many more), aren&#8217;t giving up on the option of a &#8220;privacy-preserving&#8221; centralized option &#8212; which some in their camp are dubbing &#8220;pseudo-decentralized&#8221; &#8212; with Boos claiming today that discussions are ongoing with Apple and Google about making changes to their approach.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, contacts tracing apps that don&#8217;t use a decentralized infrastructure won&#8217;t be able to carry out Bluetooth tracking in the background on Android or iOS &#8212; as the platforms limit how general apps can access Bluetooth. This means users of such apps would have to have the app open and active all the time for proximity tracking to function, with associated (negative) impacts on battery life and device usability.<\/p>\n<p>There are also (intentional) restrictions on how contacts tracing data could be centralized, as a result of the relay server model being deployed in the joint Apple-Google model.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We very much appreciate that Google and Apple are stepping up to making the operating system layer available &#8212; or putting what should be the OS actually there, which is the Bluetooth measurement and the handling of crypto and the background running of such tasks which have to keep running resiliently all the time &#8212; if you look at their protocols and if you look at whom they are provided by, the two dominant players in the mobile ecosystem, then I think that from a government perspective especially, or from lots of government perspectives, there are many open points to discuss,&#8221; said Boos today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;From a PEPP-PT perspective there are a few points to discuss because we want choice and implementing choice in terms of model &#8212; decentralized or centralized on top of their protocol creates actually the worst of both worlds &#8212; so there are many points to discuss. But contrary to the behavior that many of us who work with tech companies are used to Google and Apple are very open in these discussions and there&#8217;s no point in getting up in arms yet because these discussions are ongoing and it looks like agreement can be reached with them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t clear what specific changes PEPP-PT wants from Apple and Google &#8212; we asked for more detail during the webinar but didn&#8217;t get a response. But the group and its government backers may be hoping to dilute the tech giants&#8217; stance to make it easier to create centralized graphs of Bluetooth contacts to feed national coronavirus responses.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, Apple and Google&#8217;s API is designed to block contact matching on a server &#8212; though there might still be ways for governments (and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/moxie\/status\/1248707318646067202\">others<\/a>) to partially work around the restrictions and centralize some data.<\/p>\n<p>We reached out to Apple and Google with questions about the claimed discussions with PEPP-PT. At the time of writing, neither had responded.<\/p>\n<p>As well as Italy, the German and French governments are among those that have indicated they&#8217;re backing PEPP-PT for national apps &#8212; which suggests powerful EU Member States could be squaring up for a fight with the tech giants, along the lines of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/apple-vs-fbi\/\">Apple versus the FBI<\/a>, if pressure to tweak the API fails.<\/p>\n<p>Another key strand to this story is that PEPP-PT continues to face strident criticism from privacy and security experts in its own backyard &#8212; including after it removed a reference to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/eu-privacy-experts-push-a-decentralized-approach-to-covid-19-contacts-tracing\/\">a decentralized protocol for COVID-19 contacts tracing<\/a> that&#8217;s being developed by another European coalition, comprised of privacy and security experts, called DP-3T.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/decentralized-protocol-removed-from-eu-contact-tracing-website-with-no-notice\">Coindesk<\/a> reported on the silent edit to PEPP-PT&#8217;s website yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>Backers of DP-3T have also repeatedly queried why PEPP-PT hasn&#8217;t published code or protocols for review to-date &#8212; and even gone so far as to dub the effort a &#8220;trojan horse.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DP3T?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DP3T<\/a> entered as a candidate to so-called PEPP-PT in good faith, but it is now clear that powerful actors pushing centralised databases of Bluetooth contact tracing do not, and will not, act in good faith. <\/p>\n<p>PEPP-PT is a Trojan horse.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikarv\/status\/1250851295520600066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 16, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>ETH Z\u00fcrich&#8217;s Dr. Kenneth Paterson, who is both a part of the PEPP-PT effort and a designer of DP-3T, couldn&#8217;t shed any light on the exact changes the coalition is hoping to extract from &#8220;Gapple&#8221; when we asked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They\u2019ve still not said exactly how their system would work, so I can\u2019t say what they would need [in terms of changes to Apple and Google&#8217;s system],&#8221; he told us in an email exchange.<\/p>\n<p>Today Boos couched the removal of the reference to DP-3T on PEPP-PT&#8217;s website as a mistake &#8212; which he blamed on &#8220;bad communication.&#8221; He also claimed the coalition is still interested in including the former&#8217;s decentralized protocol within its bundle of standardized technologies. So the already sometimes fuzzy lines between the camps continue to be redrawn. (It&#8217;s also interesting to note that press emails to Boos are now being triaged by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heringschuppener.com\/en\/who-we-are\/\">Hering Schuppener<\/a>, a communications firm that sells publicity services, including crisis PR.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really sorry for that,&#8221; Boos said of the DP-3T excision. &#8220;Actually we just wanted to put the various options on the same level that are out there. There are still all these options and we very much appreciate the work that colleagues and others are doing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You know there is a hot discussion in the crypto community about this and we actually encourage this discussion because it&#8217;s always good to improve on protocols. What we must not lose sight of is&#8230; that we&#8217;re not talking about crypto here, we&#8217;re talking about pandemic management and as long as an underlying transport layer can ensure privacy that&#8217;s good enough because governments can choose whatever they want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Boos also said PEPP-PT would finally be publishing some technical documents this afternoon &#8212; opting to release information some three weeks after its public unveiling and on a Friday evening (a seven-page &#8216;high level overview&#8217; has since been put on their <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pepp-pt\/ntk-documentation\/blob\/master\/PEPP-PT_NTK_High_Level_Overview.pdf\">GitHub here<\/a> [this link has since been deleted &#8211; Ed.] &#8212; but still a far cry from code for review) &#8212; while making<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> a simultaneous plea for journalists to focus on the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; of fighting the coronavirus rather than keep obsessing over technical details.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>During today&#8217;s webinar some of the scientists backing PEPP-PT talked about how they&#8217;re testing the efficacy of Bluetooth as a proxy for tracking infection risk.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The algorithm that we&#8217;ve been working on looks at the cumulative amount of time that individuals spend in proximity with each other,&#8221; said Christophe Fraser, professor at the Nuffield Department of Medicine and Senior Group Leader in Pathogen Dynamics at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, offering a general primer on using Bluetooth proximity data for tracking viral transmission.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The aim is to predict the probability of transmission from the phone proximity data. So the ideal system reduces the requested quarantine to those who are the most at risk of being infected and doesn&#8217;t give the notification &#8212; even though some proximity event was recorded &#8212; to those people who&#8217;re not at risk of being infected.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously that&#8217;s going to be an imperfect process,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;But the key point is that in this innovative approach that we should be able to audit the extent to which that information and those notifications are correct &#8212; so we need to actually be seeing, of the people who have been sent the notification how many of them actually were infected. And of those people who were identified as contacts, how many weren&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Auditing can be done in many different ways for each system but that step is crucial.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Evaluating the effectiveness of the digital interventions will be vital, per Fraser &#8212; whose presentation could have been interpreted as making a case for public health authorities to have fuller access to contacts graphs. But it&#8217;s important to note that <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/DP-3T\/documents\">DP-3T&#8217;s decentralized protocol<\/a> makes clear provision for app users to opt-in to voluntarily share data with epidemiologists and research groups to enable them to reconstruct the interaction graph among infected and at risk users (aka to get access to a proximity graph).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important that if you&#8217;re going to do an intervention that is going to affect millions of people &#8212; in terms of these requests to [quarantine] &#8212; that that information be the best possible science or the best possible representation of the evidence at the point at which you give the notification,&#8221; added Fraser. &#8220;And therefore as we progress forwards that evidence &#8212; our understanding of the transmission of the virus &#8212; is going to improve. And in fact auditing of the app can allow that to improve, and therefore it seems essential that that information be fed back.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>None of the <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">PEPP-PT-aligned <\/span>apps that are currently being used for testing or reference are interfacing with national health authority systems, per Boos &#8212; though he cited a test in Italy that&#8217;s been plugged into a company&#8217;s health system to run tests.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have supplied the application builders with the backend, we have supplied them with sample code, we have supplied them with protocols, we have supplied them with the science of measurement, and so on and so forth. We have a working application that simply has no integration into a country&#8217;s health system &#8212; on Android and on iOS,&#8221; he noted.<\/p>\n<p>On its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pepp-pt.org\">website<\/a> PEPP-PT lists a number of corporate &#8220;members&#8221; as backing the effort &#8212; including the likes of Vodafone &#8212; alongside several research institutions including Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hhi.fraunhofer.de\/en.html\">Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute for telecoms<\/a> (HHI) which has been reported as leading the effort.<\/p>\n<p>The HHI&#8217;s executive director, Thomas Wiegand, was also on today&#8217;s call. Notably, his name initially appeared on the authorship list for the DP-3T&#8217;s white paper. However, on April 10 he was removed from the README and authorship list, per its GitHub document history. No explanation for the change was given.<\/p>\n<p>During today&#8217;s press conference Wiegand made an intervention that seems unlikely to endear him to the wider crypto and digital rights community &#8212; describing the debate around which cryptography system to use for COVID-19 contacts tracing as a &#8216;side show&#8217; and expressing concern that what he called Europe&#8217;s &#8220;open public discussion&#8221; might &#8220;destroy our ability to get ourselves as Europeans out of this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I just wanted to make everyone aware of the difficulty of this problem,&#8221; he also said. &#8220;Cryptography is only one of 12 building blocks in the system. So I really would like to have everybody go back and reconsider what problem we are in here.

She coined the term &#8220;unicorn&#8221; (in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/11\/02\/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club\/\">TechCrunch article<\/a>, no less) and has been named one of Forbes&#8217; 100 Most Powerful Women, The Top Women Investors on Midas and The Times&#8217; 100 Most Influential People.<\/p>\n<p>She has worked hands-on with companies such as Bloom Energy, Blue Nile, One Kings Lane, Rent the Runway, Shopkick and Tellme (acquired by Microsoft) during her time at KPCB, and has investments in StyleSeat, Textio, August Home, Brit+Co, Crunchbase, Dollar Shave Club and Drop via <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/cowboy-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"cowboy-ventures\">Cowboy Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.

At the law firm, he served as outside counsel to some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Square, Sonos, Spotify, Jet, Stripe and Wealthfront.<\/p>\n<p>Wang&#8217;s specialty is helping early-stage startups understand the metrics they need to hit to go from seed to Series A and beyond, and he likes to say one of his investment focuses is &#8220;Unsexy Tech,&#8221; with an interest in both consumer and enterprise tech.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited to talk to Lee and Wang about how they&#8217;re advising their portfolio companies during COVID-19, if there are new and innovative ways for early-stage startups to secure capital beyond the traditional VC route, and whether startups should hunker down or lean in during these uncertain times.<\/p>\n<p>We have plenty of questions of our own, and you&#8217;ll also be able to ask your own questions. Make sure you come prepared! But you&#8217;ll need to be an Extra Crunch member to <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=aileenleepost\">participate in the call<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be announcing more speakers very soon!

They wanted to talk about COVID-19. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of these emails over the last few weeks, as more and more companies are blasting their contacts, expressing concern, making commitments and vowing that we will get through this together.<\/p>\n<p>I used to run communications teams, so I get it; no one knows what to do these days, and all of us are looking for ways to help. But as comforting as it is to know my insurance company, food delivery service and apparel retailers are looking out for me, I find myself hoping that there&#8217;s more to the plan \u2014 that they are helping the people who actually need it (not me).<\/p>\n<p>As an investor and advisor to founders, I&#8217;ve spent the last couple of weeks as part strategist, part therapist. This crisis is unlike anything that has come before in our lifetimes, but there are things we can learn from other crises and from each other to navigate the uncertainty ahead. This is not a post about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/30\/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal\/\">layoffs <\/a>or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/10\/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-will-stress-test-startups\/\">expense planning<\/a>, although there are important things to say about both.

conspiracies like that bogus 5G claim are racing across the internet"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As the U.S. and much of the world hunkers down to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, some virus-related conspiracy theories are having a heyday. Specifically, a conspiratorial false claim that 5G technology is linked to COVID-19 gained ground, accelerating from obscurity into the rattled mainstream by way of conspiracy theorists who&#8217;d been chattering about 5G conspiracies for years.<\/p>\n<p>While there is scientific consensus around the basic medical realities of COVID-19, researchers are still filling in the gaps on a virus that no one knew existed five months ago. That relative dearth of information opens the way for ideas usually relegated to the internet&#8217;s fringes to slip into the broader conversation about the pandemic \u2014 a dangerous feature of an unprecedented global health crisis.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yonder-ai.com\/\">Yonder<\/a>, an AI company that monitors online conversations including disinformation, conspiracies that would normally remain in fringe groups are traveling to the mainstream faster during the epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>A report on coronavirus misinformation from the company notes &#8220;the mainstream is unusually accepting of conspiratorial thinking, rumors, alarm, or panic&#8221; during uncertain times \u2014 a phenomenon that explains the movement of misinformation that we&#8217;re seeing now.<\/p>\n<p>While the company estimates that it would normally take six to eight months for a &#8220;fringe narrative&#8221; to make its way from the edges of the internet into the mainstream, that interval looks like three to 14 days in the midst of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the current infodemic, we&#8217;ve seen conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation spread across the internet at an unprecedented velocity,&#8221; Yonder Chief Innovation Officer Ryan Fox told TechCrunch. He believes that the trend represents the outsized influence of &#8220;small groups of hyper passionate individuals&#8221; in driving misinformation, like the 5G claims.<\/p>\n<p>While 5G claims about the coronavirus are new, 5G conspiracies are not. &#8220;5G misinformation from online factions like QAnon or Anti-Vaxxers has existed for months, but is accelerating into the mainstream much more rapidly due to its association with COVID-19,&#8221; Fox said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nYRqoW0D2y\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/03\/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis\/\">The pandemic is already reshaping tech&#8217;s misinformation crisis<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;The pandemic is already reshaping tech&#8217;s misinformation crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/03\/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis\/embed\/#?secret=nYRqoW0D2y\" data-secret=\"nYRqoW0D2y\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The seed of the false 5G coronavirus claim may have been planted in a late January print interview with a Belgian doctor who suggested that 5G technology poses health dangers and might be linked to the virus, according to reporting from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired<\/a>. Not long after the interview, Dutch-speaking anti-5G conspiracy theorists picked up on the theory and it spread through Facebook pages and YouTube channels already trafficking in other 5G conspiracies. Somewhere along the way, people started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/884jkb\/people-in-the-uk-are-burning-5g-phone-towers-because-conspiracy-theorists-claim-they-spread-coronavirus\">burning down<\/a> mobile phone towers in the U.K., acts that government officials believe have a link to the viral misinformation, even though they apparently took down the wrong towers. &#8220;Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment,&#8221; The Guardian <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2020\/apr\/06\/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">reported<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the conspiracy went mainstream, getting traction among a pocket of credulous celebrities, including actors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-explained\">John Cusack and Woody Harrelson<\/a>, who amplified the false 5G claims to their large followings on Twitter and Instagram, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>A quick Twitter search reveals plenty of variations on the conspiracy still circulating. &#8220;&#8230; Can\u2019t everyone see that 5G was first tested in Wuhan. It\u2019s not a coincidence!,&#8221; one Twitter user claims. &#8220;5<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-vw2c0b r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">G<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\"> was first installed in <\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-vw2c0b r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">Wuhan<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\"> and now other major cities. Coincidence?,<\/span>&#8221; another asks.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, 5G misinformation has had plenty of help. As The New York Times <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/05\/12\/science\/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html\">reported<\/a> last year, Russian state-linked media outlet RT America began airing segments raising alarms about 5G and health back in 2018. By last May, RT America had aired seven different programs focused on unsubstantiated claims around 5G, including a report that 5G towers could cause nosebleeds, learning disabilities and even cancer in children. It&#8217;s possible that the current popular 5G hoax could be<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-04-09\/covid-19-link-to-5g-technology-fueled-by-coordinated-effort\"> connected to disinformation campaigns<\/a> as well, though we likely won&#8217;t learn the specifics for some time.<\/p>\n<p>In previous research on 5G-related conspiracies, social analytics company Graphika found that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/5g-health-risks-concerns\">majority<\/a> of the online conversation around 5G focused on its health effects. Accounts sharing those kinds of conspiracies overlapped with accounts pushing anti-vaccine, flat Earth and chemtrail misinformation.<\/p>\n<p>While the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory has taken off, it&#8217;s far from the only pandemic-related misinformation making the rounds online lately. From the earliest moments of the crisis, fake cures and preventative treatments offered scammers an opportunity to cash in. And even after social media companies announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/18\/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy\/\">aggressive<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/18\/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg\/\">policies<\/a> cracking down on potentially deadly health misinformation, scams and conspiracies can still surface in AI blindspots. On YouTube, some scammers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/coronavirus-youtube-ads-ban-ai-covid-19-misinformation-moderation-google-2020-4\">avoiding target words<\/a> like &#8220;coronavirus&#8221; that alert automated systems in order to sell products like a powdered supplement that its seller falsely claims can ward off the virus. With their human moderators <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/03\/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis\/\">sent home<\/a>, YouTube and other social platforms are relying on AI now more than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Social networks likely enabled the early spread of much of the COVID-19 misinformation floating around the internet, but they don&#8217;t account for all of it. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all banned Infowars founder and prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from their platforms back in 2018, but on his own site, Jones is peddling false claims that products he sells can be used to prevent or treat COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>The claims are so dangerous that the FDA even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations\/warning-letters\/free-speech-systems-llc-dba-infowarscom-605802-04092020\">stepped in this week<\/a>, issuing a warning letter to Jones telling him to cease the sale of those products. One Infowars video cited by the FDA instructs viewers concerned about the coronavirus &#8220;to go to the Infowars store, pick up a little bit of silver that really acts its way to boost your immune system and fight off infection.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As it becomes clear that the disruptions to everyday life necessitated by the novel coronavirus are likely to be with us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/danvergano\/coronavirus-distancing-new-normal\">for some time<\/a>, coronavirus conspiracies and scams are likely to stick around too.
