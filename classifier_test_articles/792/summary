Sen. Kamala Harris says she supports making sex work legal across the country — echoing recent calls for legalization from New York state lawmakers.
And I have no regrets about that.”Harris’ call to decriminalize sex work came as New York state Sens.
Jessica Ramos, Julia Salazar, Brad Hoylman and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried said they’re working to introduce a bill to do just that in the Empire State.
“Decriminalization is critical to protecting the rights and safety of people who trade sex, no matter where they are on the spectrum of choice, circumstance, and coercion,” Hoylman tweeted Monday.
The lawmakers are working with a new coalition called DecrimNY, which aims to “decriminalize, decarcerate and destigmatize the sex trade in New York City and state,” according to its website.
