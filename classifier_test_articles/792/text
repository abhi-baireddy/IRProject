Sen. Kamala Harris says she supports making sex work legal across the country — echoing recent calls for legalization from New York state lawmakers.

The 2020 presidential hopeful was asked by The Root in an interview published Tuesday whether she thinks “sex work ought to be decriminalized.” To which she responded: “I think so, I do.”

“There is an ecosystem around that that includes crimes that harm people, and for those issues I do not believe that anybody who hurts another human being or profits off their exploitation should be free of criminal prosecution,” she was quoted as saying.

“But when you’re talking about consenting adults, yes [it should be legal]. We shouldn’t consider that you can criminalize consensual behavior, as long as no one is being harmed.”

The former California attorney general was blasted by some sex workers for her recent support of an anti-sex-trafficking law that resulted in the shutdown of personal ad sites like Backpage, where many sex workers used to peddle their wares and screen Johns.

“Backpage was providing advertisements for the sale of children. Of minors,” Harris said. “And so I called for them to be shut down. And I have no regrets about that.”

Harris’ call to decriminalize sex work came as New York state Sens. Jessica Ramos, Julia Salazar, Brad Hoylman and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried said they’re working to introduce a bill to do just that in the Empire State.

“Decriminalization is critical to protecting the rights and safety of people who trade sex, no matter where they are on the spectrum of choice, circumstance, and coercion,” Hoylman tweeted Monday.

The lawmakers are working with a new coalition called DecrimNY, which aims to “decriminalize, decarcerate and destigmatize the sex trade in New York City and state,” according to its website.
