Carter Page, the former Trump campaign aide who was surveilled by the FBI, slapped the Democratic National Committee with a lawsuit, and said that he was just beginning.
Page filed the lawsuit on Thursday at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois' Eastern Division.
Defenders of the surveillance say that the warrants were obtained legally, even if they did not result in evidence of wrongdoing.
Page's attorney John Pierce said in a statement that the lawsuit would help prevent any future FISA abuses.
The lawsuit seeks "compensatory, special and punitive damages in appropriate amounts to be established at trial," without establishing a financial amount they are seeking.
