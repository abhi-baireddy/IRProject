Rep. Mark Meadows (Getty/Chip Somodevilla)“Don’t buy the spin” by Democrats claiming incriminating information about President Donald Trump was redacted from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia report by Attorney General William Barr, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) warned Tuesday.
Tweeting in anticipation of the redacted report’s Thursday release, Rep. Meadows reminded Americans that Mueller and his team helped determine what would be redacted:“Important for this week: Democrats will predictably try to seize on redactions within the Mueller report and accuse Bill Bar of hiding something.
Remember the Special Counsel and his team are directly HELPING with the redaction process.
And, in fact, the Special Counsel and his staff are helping us select the information in the report that falls into those four categories.
“But, again, the report, I'll be in a position, as I said, within a week to release the report.
