US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet Taliban officials in Qatar on Monday on his way back from a one-day trip to Afghanistan as part of efforts to salvage a historic deal signed with the armed group in February.
Pompeo will hold the highest-level talks ever between the United States and the Taliban, the US State Department said.
"Secretary Pompeo is going to meet with Taliban officials in Doha including Mullah Baradar, Taliban's chief negotiator, to press the Taliban to continue to comply with the agreement signed last month," said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.
Earlier, Pompeo met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his longtime rival Abdullah Abdullah, who conducted a parallel inauguration after contesting the presidential election result.
'Neither of the two budged'A diplomat in Kabul briefed on the meetings and two other Afghan officials said they were inconclusive.
