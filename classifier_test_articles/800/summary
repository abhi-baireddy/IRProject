President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has been disbarred, The Post has learned.
The decision, which follows his felony conviction for lying under oath, was announced in documents filed Tuesday by Manhattan’s Appellate Division, First Department and the Attorney Grievance Committee.
Cohen, who Tuesday began his marathon three days of testimony on Capitol Hill against Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“[Cohen] served on several matters as an attorney to President Trump, when the latter was CEO of the Trump Organization.
Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to begin serving out his three-year sentence.
