Same with Late Night Shows...... â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2019As the weekly target of Saturday Night Live's "humor," President Trump's disgruntlement with the show is understandable.
The poll found that 39 percent of the respondents feel that SNL is now "too political."
To be sure, the president isn't off limits when it comes to cracking jokes on television.
I am old enough to remember when humor was the primary objective on Saturday Night Live.
What will be entertaining is seeing their reactions should President Trump be re-elected.
