The United States currently has nearly 30,000 soldiers in South Korea, a decades-long deterrence to potential North Korean attack, and conducts regular joint exercises with the South Korean military as precaution against such an attack.
Coincidentally or not, Trump's own impulses toward South Korea have mirrored those North Korean demands.
While Trump's negotiation team walked out of South Korean talks to give one of our closest military allies "time to reconsider" their situation, South Korean officials appear to have done exactly that.
Soon after the suspension of talks, South Korea signed a new defense agreement with China, agreeing to establish stronger military communications to boost "cooperation" between them.
Trump has been threatening to sharply reduce the U.S. presence in South Korea unless the nation agrees to his demands; South Korea appears to be taking that threat seriously, and preparing for that possibility.
