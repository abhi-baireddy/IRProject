WASHINGTON — Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has a new job: a more than $100,000-a-year post with a gold-mining firm that’s pursuing project approvals involving the federal agency that Zinke left fewer than four months ago.
Zinke told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his work for Nevada-based U.S. Gold Corp., which focuses on mining exploration and development, would not constitute lobbying.
“We’re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward” on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone.
Karr said one of the mining projects is on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which is under the Interior Department.
But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at U.S. Gold Corp.Brown reported from Billings, Montana.
