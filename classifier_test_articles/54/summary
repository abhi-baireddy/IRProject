America’s conservatives should be those least amazed by our left’s calls for wealth confiscation.
After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done.
However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally, such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new “progressivism.” In one sense America’s left is right in its calls: The only shocking part is their explicit nature.
Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them instead silently.
The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must.
