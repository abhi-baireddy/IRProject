(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has tapped high-powered consultants to develop a science-based plan for the safe economic reopening of the region that can thwart pressure from President Donald Trump to move more rapidly, state government sources told Reuters.

Governors from seven East Coast states formed a coalition on Monday, led by New York, to develop a joint reopening plan.
The goal is to “Trump-proof” the plan, said an adviser to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.
Experts and governors have said there would need to be guarantees of ramped-up coronavirus testing before people could return to work safely.
