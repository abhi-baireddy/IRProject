“There has been a lot of misquoting of me and WikiLeaks publications.” Called a villain by some.
“That villain Julian Assange.” “He should be extradited to face justice here.” “I’m pleased to see him arrested.” And a hero by others.

Julian Assange is a hero.” And the same leak made Assange a pariah to certain Democrats.
