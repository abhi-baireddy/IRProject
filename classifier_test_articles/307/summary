One is not surprised to hear them howling for revenge against the “traitor” who revealed American war crimes to the world.
Thus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain?
King never threatened American security the way Assange did.” “Dr.
King submitted to arrest, but Assange fled to the security of an embassy.” “King loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.”The assumption disguised by these rather scholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evil system – American institutional racism – while Julian only attacked .
Julian Assange is no saint, and neither was Martin Luther King.
