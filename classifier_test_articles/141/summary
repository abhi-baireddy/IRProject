Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar claimed on Twitter Sunday that 40 percent of people in the United States have less than $400 in their bank accounts.
The 40 percent number seems to be pulled from the Federal Reserveâ€™s Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S.
It did not directly address whether respondents had $400 in their bank account.
