Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) slammed this move, decrying the patronizing of black Americans that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) having Lynne Patton as his guest at the hearing represented.
She asserted:‘Having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, being a black person, I can only imagine what is being said in private.
“To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies [racist statements] is insulting,” she says.
Although not in the hearing itself, Patton explicitly claimed recently that President Trump is not a racist.
Cohen had explicitly called Trump a racist in his opening statement and countered Meadows by asserting that there are zero black “executives” at the Trump Organization.
