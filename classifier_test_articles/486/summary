President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in Washington, D.C., January 23, 2019.
(Kevin Lamarque/REUTERS)The whistleblower who submitted a complaint on possible abuses of power by President Trump originally reported the matter to the CIA general counsel, according to a report from the New York Times.
The CIA lawyer, Courtney Simmons Elwood, then shared the report with the White House and the Department of Justice, following standard procedure with regard to complaints of this type.
However, during this time, the whistleblower learned that his concerns had been passed on to the White House.
The whistleblower complaint was released Thursday in redacted form.
