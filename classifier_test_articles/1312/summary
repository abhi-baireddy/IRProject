The hearing in Virginia House of Delegates v Bethune-Hill was bracing but, given its context and timing, rather belated.
The Supreme Court first addressed the matter in 2017, when it blessed one of the districts and sent the other 11 back to the district court for another look.
Virginia Republicans are clinging to a 51-49 edge in the statehouse; the 2011 map could help them keep it.
All this led Justice Samuel Alito to suggest asking the Virginia Supreme Court to clarify who, exactly, speaks for the Commonwealth.
The hearing did not get much clearer when it turned to the heart of the issue: whether the 2011 map violated the constitution.
