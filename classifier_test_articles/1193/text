As the 2020 Presidential campaign heats up, Democratic candidates are offering stances on a form of reparations to lessen the generational impact of slavery.

Fox News commentator Katie Pavlich is not here for that.

The Fox News host raised eyebrows everywhere when she lamented that the United States doesn't get proper credit for ending slavery.

“They keep blaming America for the sin of slavery, but the truth is, throughout human history, slavery has existed. America came along as the first country to end it within 150 years. And we get no credit for that.”

Watch below:

Host Lisa "Kennedy" Montgomery reminded Pavlich that the abolition of slavery sparked the Civil War before Pavlich continued:

"My point is that We were the country that decided to end it and we're still dealing with the issue but if you want to start a problem and inflame racial tension even more, start blaming people who have nothing to do with slavery for the sin of slavery. That is not fair, that's not the American way, and we shouldn't be doing it."

The backlash was swift.

Many were quick to point out one of the more glaring falsehoods in Pavlich's words.

The United States was far from the first country to abolish slavery.

Some also pointed out the ways in which the prison system in the United States rumbles with echoes of slavery.

Yikes.
