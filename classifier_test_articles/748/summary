ETLeaders of the United Methodist Church have rejected the One Church Plan, a measure that would have eased restrictions on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages, with delegates voting against it at a special session of the church's General Conference.
"If the One Church Plan passes, I'm certain you will not stop trying to make me fit your idea of a loving person."
Nicklas called it "a false narrative" that the One Church Plan would end the crisis or allow free choice.
"The One Church Plan ... reflects reality, the reality that we're trying to reach," Hernandez said.
