Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have announced a military ceasefire in Idlib, after a meeting in Moscow that lasted six hours.
More:"At 00.01 tonight, as in, from midnight, the ceasefire will be put in place," Erdogan told reporters on Thursday in the Russian capital.
Since last December, more than 300 civilians, including at least 100 children, have been killed in Idlib.
On Thursday, Putin offered his condolences to Erdogan over Turkish losses in a Syrian air attack but noted there were also deaths among Syrian forces.
For Turkey, the buffer zone close to their border is the most crucial: they don't want Syrian forces to go further north.
