The good news is that the European Union are sending some very negative messages on the extension of Article 50.
Article 50, the Lisbon Treaty, governs the date of departure for Britain from the European Union.
And the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, just a couple of hours ago made it clear that everyone should prepare for a no-deal Brexit on March 29.
The ideal scenario for Britain really at the end of next week, March 29, is for Britain to crash out of the EU under a no-deal Brexit.
And it’s significant that in the run-up to Brexit, British unemployment has fallen to a 44-year low.
