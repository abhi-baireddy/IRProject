The Trump administration on Wednesday opened the door for lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution.
Pompeo's decision gives Americans the legal right to sue companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties Cuba nationalised after Fidel Castro took power.
It allows lawsuits by Cubans who became United States citizens years after their properties were taken.
"European companies that are operating in Cuba will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans," she said.
Every US president since Bill Clinton has suspended the key clause to avoid those trade clashes and a potential mass of lawsuits that would prevent any future settlement with Cuba over nationalised properties.
