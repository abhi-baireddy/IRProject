A federal judge in New York dropped a few more breadcrumbs Tuesday around special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, unsealing nearly 900 pages of court documents surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump.
These are the affidavits and search warrants which gave officers the legal authority to search Cohen’s homes and offices in 2018.
That period included the first few months of Trump’s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign.
Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016.
While these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization.
