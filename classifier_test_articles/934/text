Retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters trashed President Donald Trump during a TV appearance Tuesday night, calling him a "draft dodger," "physical coward," and "disgraceful."

Peters was on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" and was asked about Trump's most recent disparaging remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, who died last August after a battle with brain cancer. The comments have resulted in a firestorm of pushback and defense of McCain from all sides.

"John McCain was, and in our hearts remains, the man Trump could never be. And Trump knows it. It's a classic case of male fears of an inadequacy," Peters said. "It goes along perfectly with his lifelong obsession with having a woman on his arm to look like teenage boys' fantasies. He wants to show us all how tough he is. But he's not tough. He's a draft dodger and he appears to be a fiscal coward with a big mouth."

Peters continued later during the interview, "Look, Trump is just shameful. He is obscene. He is disgraceful. Pick your adjective."

He added that Trump "never did anything for this country" and alleged that he "was elected apparently with the help of a hostile power."

Peters concluded his remarks on the Trump-McCain feud by saying Trump's "jealousy" toward the late senator, war hero, and POW could result in the United States getting into an unnecessary war.

"If there is a quality, an emotion, that will ruin lives and start wars, it is jealousy. And Trump appears to me to be consumed by it."
