Retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters trashed President Donald Trump during a TV appearance Tuesday night, calling him a "draft dodger," "physical coward," and "disgraceful."
"John McCain was, and in our hearts remains, the man Trump could never be.
He's a draft dodger and he appears to be a fiscal coward with a big mouth."
Peters continued later during the interview, "Look, Trump is just shameful.
Peters concluded his remarks on the Trump-McCain feud by saying Trump's "jealousy" toward the late senator, war hero, and POW could result in the United States getting into an unnecessary war.
