Democrats must put this issue front and center,” he said in a petition to pressure the DNC to hold the debate.
Inslee’s petition follows a similar one from Youth Climate Strike that had neared its goal of 30,000 signatures as of Tuesday night.
The DNC has not released details about its debates beyond the schedule, declining thus far to make commitments about topics or structure.
“While Republicans refuse to even acknowledge that climate change is real, Democrats are eager to put forward their solutions to combat climate change, and we will absolutely have these discussions during the 2020 primary process,” the DNC said in a statement to The Hill when asked about Inslee’s petition.
