Joe Biden signaled on Wednesday that he won’t be tacking to the middle as the socialist candidate, Bernie Sanders, exited the race for the Democrat nomination for president.
What I liked about Bernie was that he said what he believed, no matter who was in the room.
Bernie suspended his campaign today, but while you can suspend a campaign, you can’t suspend a movement.
Jill and I can’t wait to work with him and Jane on building a more progressive future.
Bernie Sanders is OUT!
