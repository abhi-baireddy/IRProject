As a libertarian at a socialist conference, I found plenty to object to and, on occasion, snicker at.
Speakers come from different caucuses of the DSA, including a libertarian socialist faction represented today by John Michael Col√≥n.
One thing that quickly becomes clear is that DSA socialists are a factional bunch, and new splinter movements are perpetually rising up to challenge the old guard.
For both libertarians and socialists, most of society's problems can be traced back to a single root cause.
Many of the major policy divides between libertarians and socialists are real and powerful.
