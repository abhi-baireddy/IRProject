On Tuesday, an interview with former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann provided insight into how the Christian evangelicals see Trump, the reasons for the support became clear.
The three-times-married, three-time cheater with porn stars and Playboy bunnies whose name is synonymous with greed as “biblical” and “godly.”‘[Trump] is highly biblical, and I would say to your listeners, we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime.
How does President Trump fulfill prophecy?
The “Deep State” wants Islamic jihad; Trump bashes a Muslim congresswoman and promised to ban Muslims from the country.
The “Deep State” wants godly gender roles to disappear; Trump banned trans soldiers from the military.
