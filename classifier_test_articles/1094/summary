After a complaint five years ago, the TSA pledged to improve oversight and training for its workers on hair pat-downs.
The TSA would not say if it had ever found a weapon in a passengerâ€™s hair.
Most black women and other women of color we heard from described the hair pat-downs as intrusive and disrespectful.
Natural black hair has been deemed unhygienic, unprofessional and radical, and it has been policed for centuries.
Conner, the ACLU lawyer, said black airport screeners seem just as likely to conduct hair pat-downs as white screeners.
