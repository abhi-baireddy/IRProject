WASHINGTON â€” The House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday to terminate President Donald Trump's national-emergency declaration, which allows him to reprogram federal funds for the construction of additional physical barriers along the US-Mexico border.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged his full support for the emergency declaration in advance of Trump's decision earlier in February.
That's a national emergency," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference.
While the White House has reiterated that they do not believe they are creating a new precedent with the emergency declaration, Democrats are not in agreement.
