Trump vetoes resolution to end US involvement in Yemen Trump said it was a "dangerous attempt" to weaken his constitutional authoritiesPresident Donald Trump has vetoed a resolution to stop U.S. military assistance to the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in Yemen.
In issuing the veto, Trump said, "This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities."
The House approved the resolution on April 4, and the Senate passed the measure on March 13.
Congress does not have the two-thirds majority in the House or Senate to override Trump's veto.
The Trump administration argued that the assistance did not constitute active engagement in the hostilities, which is why Trump called the resolution "unnecessary."
