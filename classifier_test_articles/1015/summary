According to ABC News, the ‘blocked numbers’ Donald J Trump Jr called about his meeting with the Russian FSB asset Natalia Veselnitskaya include Howard Lorber.
Howard Lorber donated to Trump Victory; Howard Lorber was instrumental in Trump Tower Moscow.
Again, this sounds much like Trump Tower Moscow, started by Howard Lorber, about which Michael Cohen pled guilty about lying to Congress?
Alex Oronov, father in law of Howard Lorber employee Bryan Cohen, lived here at some time before his untimely death.
Howard Lorber is first and foremost Trump Sr’s friend, but his dad described Lorber only in terms of knowing Junior.
