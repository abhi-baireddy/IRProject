The numbers wildly exceeded all expectations, including estimates by U.S. intelligence. The most striking sight at the prison entrance was a mound of human hair lying on the raw concrete floor. Clumps of it—some brown, some graying, most of it greasy or matted—had been shaved off the heads and faces of fighters before they were taken to group cells. “Lice,” one of the guards told me.\n\nThe prison at Dashisha, in eastern Deir Ezzor province, had been an oil-storage facility. In just four days, the compound of modest brick and stucco buildings had been filled with fifteen hundred fighters from countries on four continents, including France, Libya, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq, and the United States, the warden told me.&nbsp;Average-sized rooms had been fitted with metal doors; each cell had a small barred window that I had to stand on my tiptoes to peer through. Each one was crammed, wall to wall, with dozens of men squatting on the floor. The *ISIS*{: .small} fighters wore new T-shirts, in army green, and whatever trousers they had on when they were captured.\n\nAfter five years of war with the Islamic State, the biggest problem for the winners is coping with the losers. The aftermath has produced one of the world’s most perplexing postwar challenges: there are tens of thousands of captured *ISIS*{: .small} members whom no nation wants to repatriate, and the local militia holding them has neither the resources nor the personnel to keep them indefinitely. More than five thousand *ISIS*{: .small} fighters surrendered in the final month of fighting alone. Thousands more were captured earlier in the conflict. They’re dispersed among the new pop-up prisons in northeast Syria. A few hundred of the most severely wounded are in a small hospital, with the foreign fighters crowded in its basement for security. The hospital stench was overwhelming, even through a mask. “Sepsis,” a medic told me. Between December and March, another sixty-three thousand family members of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters—wives enveloped in black niqabs that cover their faces, and bedraggled young children—also poured out of Baghouz, the last *ISIS*{: .small} redoubt in Syria. They’re held separately, most in tents, at a dusty, malodorous camp in al-Hawl that already held ten thousand. The prisons, the hospital, and the camp are all bursting.\n\n“There is nothing else in the world that compares to this unprecedented humanitarian and security situation, which is legally complicated and politically fraught,” a senior State Department official told me. So far, the local Syrian Democratic Forces militia (S.D.F.), the U.S.-led coalition of more than seventy countries, and several international relief agencies have been improvising—total ad-hockery, in the words of a senior U.S. military commander involved in Syria.\n\nJust sorting out the fighters’ real names and nationalities has been messy. Many use noms de guerre. Few have identity papers or passports. Some don’t want to reveal their identities—or their roles with *ISIS*{: .small}. I interviewed three of the prison’s foreign detainees: a middle-aged misfit from Chicago, who was lured to Syria by *ISIS*{: .small} propaganda; a Moroccan who, as an “emir of morality,” acknowledged witnessing at least ten stonings of women accused of adultery and the burning of some forty Yazidi women who were put in a cage, covered with fuel, and set on fire; and a lanky Turk with a prosthetic leg, which was his souvenir from a U.S. air strike. The Turk, Farouk Asser, insisted that he once worked at a pizza parlor in Istanbul and, after joining *ISIS*{: .small}, merely worked as a cook and at a local police station. Every few sentences, the warden muttered, “He’s a liar. He’s a liar.” Asser, according to the warden, was one of the early *ISIS*{: .small} recruiters who helped foreign fighters cross the border from Turkey into Syria.\n\nThe pop-up prisons are combustible politically and vulnerable physically, a dozen U.S. diplomats and military officials told me. *ISIS*{: .small} has its roots in an earlier prison culture—notably in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two infamous prisons in Iraq that were run by the United States between 2003 and 2011. Its founding “caliph,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was&nbsp;[held](http://www.soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-from-bucca-to-kobani-the-hybrid-ideology-of-the-islamic-state/)&nbsp;at Camp Bucca for nine months, in 2004. He and other future *ISIS*{: .small} leaders created an embryonic network there.\n\nThe movement grew rapidly after Baghdadi [pronounced](http://www.understandingwar.org/report/al-qaeda-iraq-resurgent), in 2012,&nbsp;that&nbsp;its [first priority](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/sep/15/500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq/)&nbsp;should be “releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.” Over the next year, Al Qaeda in Iraq attacked eight prisons. In July, 2013, more than five hundred inmates—including top Al Qaeda leaders&nbsp;[sentenced](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/sep/15/500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq/)&nbsp;to death—were freed in final simultaneous&nbsp;[attacks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda/al-qaeda-says-it-freed-500-inmates-in-iraq-jail-break-idUSBRE96M0C720130723)&nbsp;on two prisons, including Abu Ghraib. Many inmates escaped into Syria, where Al Qaeda in Iraq evolved into the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The prison raids—the so-called breaking-the-walls campaign—provided the first evidence that Baghdadi’s men were “a professional military force capable of planning, training, resourcing and executing synchronized and complex attacks,” as the Institute for the Study of War reported. By 2014, *ISIS*{: .small} had enough men to blitz across Syria and Iraq, and captured territory the size of Britain. Despite its recent loss of terrain in both Syria and Iraq, U.S. military and S.D.F. officials told me, *ISIS*{: .small} underground cells still have those basic capabilities. Prison breaks, they added, are almost certain to be one way that the group tries to rebuild.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5cb4df8c546f8f3881e5c611]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe first prisoner I interviewed at Dashisha was Lirim Sulejmani, the American from Chicago. He had surrendered two weeks earlier. He was balding and thin; he told me that he was forty-three. His arms were awkwardly handcuffed behind him with thin plastic bands. He seemed detached, and both physically and psychologically defeated. We sat on the floor of the prison’s makeshift office, which had no furniture. His wife and three children were probably at the al-Hawl camp, he said, but he wasn’t sure. He was sucked into *ISIS*{: .small} by its utopian promises. “I wanted to make hegira,” he told me. “I wanted to live under Sharia,” or Islamic law. Hegira, traditionally used to describe the Prophet Muhammad’s&nbsp;[migration](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hijrah-Islam)&nbsp;from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution, had become an *ISIS*{: .small} buzzword—and&nbsp;a [recruiting tool](http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Hijra-before-ISIS.php). The pull is as powerful as the idea of jihad. After Baghdadi declared the Islamic State, in 2014, he appealed to Muslims worldwide to make hegira, to re-create a country that ruled as in the Prophet’s time, fourteen centuries ago.\n\nUp to three hundred Americans attempted to join or succeeded in joining jihadist movements in Syria and Iraq, according to a&nbsp;2014 [report](https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/TravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf)&nbsp;by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. Dozens were arrested before they left the United States.&nbsp;[More than a hundred](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hagel-100-americans-have-joined-isis)&nbsp;ended up fighting with *ISIS*{: .small}, according to Chuck Hagel, who was then the Defense Secretary. A&nbsp;[few](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/02/05/583407221/americans-in-isis-some-300-tried-to-join-12-have-returned-to-u-s)&nbsp;rose to leadership positions. The Americans tended to fall into&nbsp;[three categories](https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/TravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf): the early pioneers and ideologues who brought skills with them; the “networked travelers” who had personal connections with others in *ISIS*{: .small}; and the loners, lured by propaganda, who made their own way to the Islamic State. When *ISIS*{: .small} lost its last piece of territory, on March 23rd, fewer than two dozen Americans—fighters and family members—were found among the tens of thousands, U.S. officials told me. Sulejmani’s family accounted for five of them.&nbsp;Many other Americans are presumed to have died, possibly in U.S. air strikes.\n\nSulejmani seemed to fit the loner category. He reminded me of misfits I’ve interviewed in war zones well beyond the Middle East, including unemployed Brits who became mercenaries in Angola and American Vietnam veterans who signed up to fight in the Rhodesian civil war. Sulejmani told a woeful life story. He was born in Kosovo but fled, with his mother and siblings, during Serbia’s&nbsp;[war](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html)&nbsp;there, two decades ago. He ended up in Northbrook, a Chicago suburb. He had limited training; a series of jobs didn’t seem to last long. He married a woman of Polish descent. One of their daughters died young. He later looked for work in Canada, where his wife had contacts. *ISIS*{: .small} lured him more than three years ago, with promises of an engineering job and housing—and a community where he would fit in. His family made their way to Syria through Turkey. He was dispatched briefly to Iraq, for military and religious training. He learned to operate an AK-47 automatic rifle but claimed he never fought, even though he stayed with *ISIS*{: .small} as it retreated from Raqqa, the Islamic State capital, to towns and villages and, finally, a farming hamlet on the Euphrates River. In the end, U.S. officials told me, the *ISIS*{: .small} loyalists in Baghouz were the most hardcore.\n\n“I shot about twenty bullets when I was doing the training in Mosul. And I shot one bullet in a house, by accident, in the ceiling. That’s as much fighting as I did,” Sulejmani insisted. “I carried the gun since the first day when I came to Dar al-Islamiyyah [House of Islam] until I left Baghouz. Towards the end it was rusted, but my goal wasn’t to come fight. It was making&nbsp;hegira. I was pushed a certain way, which I went. I liked to give it a try. It just didn’t work.” He shrugged.\n\nAmong the *ISIS*{: .small} fighters, the truth is often ephemeral. Many of them lie either to their captors or to themselves, a senior U.S. commander involved in Syria told me. Sulejmani recounted having a hard time fitting in, refusing to go to the front lines because of back problems, scrounging to feed his family, and spending time with a group of Albanians who joined *ISIS*{: .small}.\n\nI asked if he still supported Baghdadi, who appeared only once in public, to declare the Islamic State, in 2014. Since then, the self-appointed caliph has issued only a handful of audio messages. The last one was in August, when he&nbsp;[admitted](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/middleeast/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-recording/index.html)&nbsp;that *ISIS*{: .small} was losing ground. “Right now, to be honest with you, and you don’t have to write this down, for me he’s been dead for over two years,” Sulejmani said. “I did not hear from him. Do you know if he’s alive?” When I said I didn’t, he mused, “It’s been a disappointment. It’s been a betrayal of, the way I see it, for people that were called to make hegira.” U.S. and S.D.F. officials believe that Baghdadi may be in the desert region along the Iraq-Syria border.\n\nIf given the chance to live in another caliphate, I asked Sulejmani, would he do it again? “I would,” he said. “For me, at this point, everything is religious. This world, sooner or later, will end, like it ends for everybody. For me, it’s important what comes after. I had a mother—she passed away. Father, passed away. Had a daughter—she passed away. We all die. My belief is that we’re put in this world to worship Allah. So, *Inshallah* [God willing], there will be Jinah, or paradise, after it.” So, I asked, why hadn’t he become a martyr, or *shahid*, in the language of jihadists? “I like life,” he said. “I did not come to die here. I came to live under Sharia. I mean, it was open enrollment.”\n\nAfter the mass surrender of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters and families, I asked, will there be enough people who believe that creating a new caliphate is still worth it?\n\n“I believe so,” he replied.\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe camp for the dregs of *ISIS*{: .small} in al-Hawl was one of the dreariest places I’ve seen over forty years in the Middle East. On the morning I visited, it was chaotic and cacophonous. Litter was everywhere. The whole area stank. Trucks were still hauling people in, even though a U.N. agency had&nbsp;[declared](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Al-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf)&nbsp;the camp “extremely above capacity.” More than seventy-three thousand people were living in an area of less than four square kilometres.\n\nThey were divided into two groups, held behind high chain-link fences that were topped with barbed wire. Iraqis and Syrians, who accounted for more than eighty per cent, were on one side. I went into the “annex,” on the other side, which held more than ten thousand foreigners from dozens of countries. Most were the family members of male *ISIS*{: .small} fighters. Women who had arrived recently were huddled with dirty children next to their possessions in little bundles on the ground. There weren’t enough places to put them. Rahila Osman, a small Uighur woman with two children, came up to ask if I was with an N.G.O. “We’ve been here three nights out in the cold—no blankets, no tent,” she said. She had moved to the Islamic State from China’s western Xinjiang Province, three years ago. Her husband had been killed in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition in Hajin, late last year. Like every other woman I saw, her face was completely covered by a black veil. I asked if she still believed in the caliphate. “I do,” she said. “I want to keep my niqab.”\n\nThe foreign women included both victims and perpetrators. Women were among the earliest targets of *ISIS*{: .small}, for slavery and sex trafficking. Many women who ended up in al-Hawl had experienced gender-based violence, according to the [U.N. Population Fund](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Al-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf)*.*{: .small}&nbsp;A “high number” of adolescent girls were already mothers, or pregnant; some had been child brides. Many women had children by two or three men, because their husbands were killed fighting for the Islamic State, so they wed again, voluntarily or involuntarily, to survive, S.D.F. and U.S. officials told me.\n\nYet thousands of women in al-Hawl were also “suspected foreign fighters,” the U.N. reported. Women played&nbsp;[valuable roles](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/opinion/islamic-state-female-fighters.html)&nbsp;in *ISIS*{: .small}, ranging from suicide bombers to spies, morality police, and assassins. They were among “the most brutal enforcers,” according to a report by the&nbsp;[International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism](https://www.icsve.org/the-operational-ranks-and-roles-of-female-isis-operatives-from-assassins-and-morality-police-to-spies-and-suicide-bombers/). *ISIS*{: .small} had all-female units. The al-Khansa Battalion was made up largely of foreign women from Europe; the majority of them spoke French. The Aumahat al-Moaminin Battalion was led by Iraqi women. The most lethal unit was the special-operations battalion named after the Prophet Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. Mariam Nasser, a twenty-three-year-old from the Maldives, had two children by two husbands. The first husband was killed and the second was captured. She acknowledged that she had military training. “Every man carried a gun,” she told me. “Every woman, too.”\n\nAmong the people I met, destitution did not deter their loyalty. Salimah Athilayabah, a twenty-two-year-old Chechen from Russia, lived in one of the camp’s few cinderblock facilities covered with a bright-blue tarp roof. It held dozens of women and children, many of them crying. The shelters had no furniture, only mats on the ground; several of them were shared. Athilayabah told me that she had joined *ISIS*{: .small} four years ago. “We and everyone like me came to assist God,” she told me. Her husband was killed two years ago, in a coalition air strike. “Every day, we saw death and killing and had fear from the air strikes,” she said. She had finally fled Baghouz with her children, two months earlier. “Still,” she said, “there’s a caliphate in our hearts.”\n\nInternational agencies are scrambling to provide shelter and food for the *ISIS*{: .small} families. Without a longer-term plan, however, U.S. officials fear that the camp, like the prisons in Iraq, will become an ecosystem that perpetuates *ISIS*{: .small} ideology—and just breeds another generation.&nbsp;[Sixty-five per cent](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-humanitarian-response-al-hol-camp-situation-report-no-1)&nbsp;of al-Hawl’s residents—some forty-eight thousand—are under the age of eighteen. Almost a quarter of them are under the age of five.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5cb50da73adeca2db6bf280e]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn their final days, the Islamic State’s fighters and families surrendered to the S.D.F. The militia of Kurds and Arabs, which is backed by the U.S.-led coalition, has absorbed ninety per cent of the costs of converting, staffing, and protecting the makeshift prisons and providing for the prisoners, General Mazloum Kobani Abdi told me. But it is not a state, and it has neither the resources nor the institutions to cope long-term with the aftermath of the Islamic State. The coalition that pressed the S.D.F. to fight *ISIS*{: .small} has provided little financial or logistical help now that it has succeeded. “We are cutting the costs from the salaries of our soldiers,” Mazloum said. The situation is not sustainable.\n\nTo deal with the thousands of Syrians in *ISIS*{: .small}, Mazloum launched a makeshift rehabilitation program. The pilot project was in al-Karamah, a town near Raqqa and a bastion for the kind of ultra-conservative Salafis who joined *ISIS*{: .small}. I saw many men on its streets wearing short thobes, with hems above their ankles, a telltale sign of devout Muslims who emulate practices from the Prophet Muhammad’s time. “This region is agricultural and tribal and very traditional,” [Mohammed al-Zeeb](https://www.hawarnews.com/en/haber/sheikh-of-clan-daesh-ideas-danger-to-our-regions-states-must-restore-their-citizens-h8212.html), a sheikh in the Afadla tribe, one of [the largest](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyNote39-Raqqa.pdf) around Raqqa, told me. He heads the local rehabilitation program. “Most of our people were with *ISIS*{: .small}, frankly.” Some four hundred men from al-Karamah joined the jihadi movement.\n\nThe promise of rehabilitation was a key building block in beating *ISIS*{: .small}. Mazloum’s original militia was Kurdish. To take the fight into Syria’s Arab heartland, he had to mobilize tribal support and thousands of Arab troops. The quid pro quo was Mazloum’s vow to return the Syrians in *ISIS*{: .small}—if they had not engaged in major felonies—to their communities. “I met with all the tribes before any campaign for liberation,” Mazloum explained. “I asked them to pull out their people in the tribes from *ISIS*{: .small}. And we promised them that anyone who is returning from *ISIS*{: .small}, we will give him a credit for his life and will not punish him or treat him badly. Secondly, because we are liberating Raqqa or tribal land, the tribes should give a lot of people to join the S.D.F. This is one reason for our success. We recruited about three thousand people from Raqqa.” For the last brutal months of the war, tribes in Deir Ezzor recruited about ten thousand Arab fighters to join Mazloum’s force.\n\nSince 2017, when al-Karamah was liberated, a hundred former members of *ISIS*{: .small} have gone through rehabilitation. (Another hundred or so died fighting for the Islamic State; many were suicide bombers, the sheikh said.) The survivors were held in a rehab center instead of a prison, most for at least a year. They went through retraining on Islam, but treatment and socialization were just as important. The sheikh showed me a video, on his cell phone, of a graduation ceremony a few days earlier for thirty-eight men. Most were young. All were dressed in sweatsuits. Their heads were shaved.\n\n“These prisoners will go back to their families and go back to help with the rebuilding of this county,” a tribal elder told the former jihadis. “They will not ruin this country because they have become different. They were imprisoned, but not imprisoned like arrested or humiliated. We raised them and embraced them, the tribal men and leaders, to bring them back to the correct path.” Each of the graduates made his way down a receiving line, shaking hands with each elder.\n\nHamoud Ahmad Khalf, thirty-six, was released from the program in September. He fit a common local profile. As a younger man, he had to serve in the Syrian Army. He defected after Daraa, where the Arab Uprising began, in 2011, when the government ordered troops to turn on fellow-Syrians. He went back to al-Karamah and worked for the municipality. When *ISIS*{: .small} seized the area, in 2014, he was told to pledge *bayat*, or allegiance, or lose his job. Because of his military training, he told me, he was recruited for the *ISIS*{: .small} police. Like many Syrians, he claimed, he had a low-profile job taking community complaints. “It was the foreigners in *ISIS*{: .small} who had all the power,” he said. He was injured in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition, and still had shrapnel in his knee; he relied on crutches to walk.\n\nAyman Hussein Essa, a strapping, muscular twenty-five-year-old who could have been a fullback, had graduated from the program five days earlier. He had been in rehabilitation—he called it jail—for a year and a half. He claimed to have repented. “We have paid the price,” he told me, as we sat on the floor of the sheikh’s modest office, lit by a single light bulb. “We were in jail, so I guarantee we will never go back to *ISIS*{: .small}, no matter what happens.” Essa left school in the fifth grade. The sheikh said the former *ISIS*{: .small} supporter could neither read nor write. “I don’t even have a phone,” Essa told me.\n\nBoth Essa and Khalf were unemployed. “All of those who have been released,” Essa said, “are still waiting for a job opportunity—or any opportunity.” The field for recruitment by a revived version of *ISIS*{: .small} or another movement may still be ripe.\n\nRehabilitation hasn’t worked for everyone who went through it. The S.D.F. released a thousand captured Syrians who collaborated with *ISIS*{: .small}. But dozens simply turned around and went back to *ISIS*{: .small}. “We just start step one,” the sheikh told me. “The first step needs to lead to a thousand steps to correct them.” Salar Malla, Mazloum’s aide-de-camp, was more sanguine. “We have two battles to fight—one military and one mentality,” he told me. “We are only winning one of them.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn mid-February, as *ISIS*{: .small} fighters started surrendering in droves, President Trump&nbsp;[tweeted](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/17/politics/donald-trump-isis-fighters-europe-intl/index.html)&nbsp;a demand to European allies, notably Britain, France, and Germany, to take back more than eight hundred European fighters captured in Syria. “The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,” he wrote. “Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory\\!”\n\nCitizens of more than eighty nations have joined *ISIS*{: .small}, but few of their governments have&nbsp;[stepped up](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-humanitarian-response-al-hol-camp-situation-report-no-1)&nbsp;to take them back. “The United States will continue to repatriate and, when appropriate, prosecute its citizens, as we have done in the past,” a State Department official told me. Kazakhstan, Macedonia, and Morocco announced repatriations of some of their citizens. Iraq has pledged to eventually take back its citizens, although at least [thirty-one thousand](https://www.france24.com/en/20190411-syria-kurds-say-deal-made-31000-displaced-iraqis-go-home?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ebb%2004.12.19&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) are in Syria. [Twenty thousand *ISIS*{: .small} suspects](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/05/iraq-flawed-prosecution-isis-suspects)&nbsp;were already detained during a parallel military campaign there. Iraq has also been widely criticized for summary justice of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters and supporters. Last year, the *Times* reported on the&nbsp;[trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-trials.html)&nbsp;of a forty-two-year-old Turkish housewife who had travelled to the Islamic State with her husband. It lasted ten minutes; she was sentenced to death by hanging. In the course of the next two hours, thirteen other women were sentenced to die.\n\nMost other countries are reluctant. The German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas,&nbsp;[said](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/18/695831550/european-leaders-reluctant-to-meet-trumps-demands-to-take-back-captive-isis-figh)&nbsp;that the Germans in *ISIS*{: .small} could be repatriated only if it was certain that they could be tried. Gathering sufficient evidence to detain, try, or imprison any of the *ISIS*{: .small} fighters is an enormous challenge—unless, as one Western official told me, they were depicted in social-media videos actually beheading people. Britain&nbsp;[stripped](https://www.justsecurity.org/63164/citizenship-stripping-isis-members-uk-united-kingdom-bangladesh-britain-experience-shamima-begum/)&nbsp;citizenship from some *ISIS*{: .small} members rather than take them back. Other countries aren’t ready to take them in. “We may not be in a position, as each and every one of them comes back to Canada, that we’re at that stage where we can arrest them,” Gilles Michaud, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,&nbsp;[said](https://globalnews.ca/news/5004932/rcmp-preparing-for-return-isis/), in February, in an interview with Global News. France could have a problem repatriating the wives of fighters. Under French law, the women could accuse the government of abducting them from Syria against their will; a judge could be compelled to free them, a French official told me. Some countries, notably Libya and Yemen, have their own wars; there’s no reliable government to take, much less try, their citizens. They also have their own *ISIS*{: .small} branches. Other *ISIS*{: .small} followers, such as the Uighurs from China and the Chechens from Russia, are persecuted minorities at home—and don’t want to return to their homeland, even if they were offered repatriation.\n\nSome governments are even reluctant to lock them up at home, for fear that *ISIS*{: .small} ideology would&nbsp;[infect](https://ctc.usma.edu/the-danger-of-prison-radicalization-in-the-west/)&nbsp;others in their jails. Richard Reid converted to Islam in a British prison. In 2001, he tried to ignite an explosive hidden in his sneaker on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami. The so-called&nbsp;[shoe bomber](https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/25/us/richard-reid-fast-facts/index.html)&nbsp;is now in a maximum-security prison in Colorado, where he is prohibited from praying with other inmates.\n\nAs governments balked at repatriation, the S.D.F.&nbsp;[appealed](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/03/25/us-backed-kurdish-fighters-want-international-tribunal-for-isis-detainees/)&nbsp;last month for the creation of an international tribunal “for justice to take its course.” So far, there’s been little interest in that option, either. A week before the S.D.F. ousted *ISIS*{: .small} fighters from Syrian territory, Mazloum was thinking more about the unintended consequences of the war. “All of those people spent five years of their life serving in the *ISIS*{: .small} caliphate,” he told me, at his forward operating base, near the Iraqi border. “All of these people still believe in the *ISIS*{: .small} ideology. We are forced to solve this problem with the countries that they belong to. If we don’t, it’s going to be dangerous for all of our futures.”\n\n","articleSection":"dispatch","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Robin

collapse of the Islamic State’s caliphate</a>, I visited one of the new “pop-up prisons” that had been hastily converted to hold thousands of surrendering <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters in Syria. The numbers wildly exceeded all expectations, including estimates by U.S. intelligence. The most striking sight at the prison entrance was a mound of human hair lying on the raw concrete floor. Clumps of it—some brown, some graying, most of it greasy or matted—had been shaved off the heads and faces of fighters before they were taken to group cells. “Lice,” one of the guards told me.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>The prison at Dashisha, in eastern Deir Ezzor province, had been an oil-storage facility. In just four days, the compound of modest brick and stucco buildings had been filled with fifteen hundred fighters from countries on four continents, including France, Libya, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq, and the United States, the warden told me. Average-sized rooms had been fitted with metal doors; each cell had a small barred window that I had to stand on my tiptoes to peer through. Each one was crammed, wall to wall, with dozens of men squatting on the floor. The <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters wore new T-shirts, in army green, and whatever trousers they had on when they were captured.</p><p>After five years of war with the Islamic State, the biggest problem for the winners is coping with the losers. The aftermath has produced one of the world’s most perplexing postwar challenges: there are tens of thousands of captured <em class="small">ISIS</em> members whom no nation wants to repatriate, and the local militia holding them has neither the resources nor the personnel to keep them indefinitely. More than five thousand <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters surrendered in the final month of fighting alone. Thousands more were captured earlier in the conflict. They’re dispersed among the new pop-up prisons in northeast Syria. A few hundred of the most severely wounded are in a small hospital, with the foreign fighters crowded in its basement for security. The hospital stench was overwhelming, even through a mask. “Sepsis,” a medic told me. Between December and March, another sixty-three thousand family members of <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters—wives enveloped in black niqabs that cover their faces, and bedraggled young children—also poured out of Baghouz, the last <em class="small">ISIS</em> redoubt in Syria. They’re held separately, most in tents, at a dusty, malodorous camp in al-Hawl that already held ten thousand. The prisons, the hospital, and the camp are all bursting.</p><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>“There is nothing else in the world that compares to this unprecedented humanitarian and security situation, which is legally complicated and politically fraught,” a senior State Department official told me. So far, the local Syrian Democratic Forces militia (S.D.F.), the U.S.-led coalition of more than seventy countries, and several international relief agencies have been improvising—total ad-hockery, in the words of a senior U.S. military commander involved in Syria.</p><p>Just sorting out the fighters’ real names and nationalities has been messy. Many use noms de guerre. Few have identity papers or passports. Some don’t want to reveal their identities—or their roles with <em class="small">ISIS</em>. I interviewed three of the prison’s foreign detainees: a middle-aged misfit from Chicago, who was lured to Syria by <em class="small">ISIS</em> propaganda; a Moroccan who, as an “emir of morality,” acknowledged witnessing at least ten stonings of women accused of adultery and the burning of some forty Yazidi women who were put in a cage, covered with fuel, and set on fire; and a lanky Turk with a prosthetic leg, which was his souvenir from a U.S. air strike. The Turk, Farouk Asser, insisted that he once worked at a pizza parlor in Istanbul and, after joining <em class="small">ISIS</em>, merely worked as a cook and at a local police station. Every few sentences, the warden muttered, “He’s a liar.

He reminded me of misfits I’ve interviewed in war zones well beyond the Middle East, including unemployed Brits who became mercenaries in Angola and American Vietnam veterans who signed up to fight in the Rhodesian civil war. Sulejmani told a woeful life story. He was born in Kosovo but fled, with his mother and siblings, during Serbia’s <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html&quot;}" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">war</a> there, two decades ago. He ended up in Northbrook, a Chicago suburb. He had limited training; a series of jobs didn’t seem to last long. He married a woman of Polish descent. One of their daughters died young. He later looked for work in Canada, where his wife had contacts. <em class="small">ISIS</em> lured him more than three years ago, with promises of an engineering job and housing—and a community where he would fit in. His family made their way to Syria through Turkey. He was dispatched briefly to Iraq, for military and religious training. He learned to operate an AK-47 automatic rifle but claimed he never fought, even though he stayed with <em class="small">ISIS</em> as it retreated from Raqqa, the Islamic State capital, to towns and villages and, finally, a farming hamlet on the Euphrates River. In the end, U.S. officials told me, the <em class="small">ISIS</em> loyalists in Baghouz were the most hardcore.</p><p>“I shot about twenty bullets when I was doing the training in Mosul. And I shot one bullet in a house, by accident, in the ceiling. That’s as much fighting as I did,” Sulejmani insisted. “I carried the gun since the first day when I came to Dar al-Islamiyyah [House of Islam] until I left Baghouz. Towards the end it was rusted, but my goal wasn’t to come fight. It was making hegira. I was pushed a certain way, which I went. I liked to give it a try. It just didn’t work.” He shrugged.</p><p>Among the <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters, the truth is often ephemeral. Many of them lie either to their captors or to themselves, a senior U.S. commander involved in Syria told me. Sulejmani recounted having a hard time fitting in, refusing to go to the front lines because of back problems, scrounging to feed his family, and spending time with a group of Albanians who joined <em class="small">ISIS</em>.</p><p>I asked if he still supported Baghdadi, who appeared only once in public, to declare the Islamic State, in 2014. Since then, the self-appointed caliph has issued only a handful of audio messages. The last one was in August, when he <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/middleeast/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-recording/index.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/middleeast/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-recording/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">admitted</a> that <em class="small">ISIS</em> was losing ground. “Right now, to be honest with you, and you don’t have to write this down, for me he’s been dead for over two years,” Sulejmani said. “I did not hear from him. Do you know if he’s alive?” When I said I didn’t, he mused, “It’s been a disappointment. It’s been a betrayal of, the way I see it, for people that were called to make hegira.” U.S. and S.D.F. officials believe that Baghdadi may be in the desert region along the Iraq-Syria border.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>If given the chance to live in another caliphate, I asked Sulejmani, would he do it again? “I would,” he said. “For me, at this point, everything is religious. This world, sooner or later, will end, like it ends for everybody. For me, it’s important what comes after. I had a mother—she passed away. Father, passed away. Had a daughter—she passed away. We all die. My belief is that we’re put in this world to worship Allah. So, <em>Inshallah</em> [God willing], there will be Jinah, or paradise, after it.” So, I asked, why hadn’t he become a martyr, or <em>shahid</em>, in the language of jihadists? “I like life,” he said. “I did not come to die here. I came to live under Sharia. I mean, it was open enrollment.”</p><p>After the mass surrender of <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters and families, I asked, will there be enough people who believe that creating a new caliphate is still worth it?</p><p>“I believe so,” he replied.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">The camp for the dregs of <em class="small">ISIS</em> in al-Hawl was one of the dreariest places I’ve seen over forty years in the Middle East.

Iraqis and Syrians, who accounted for more than eighty per cent, were on one side. I went into the “annex,” on the other side, which held more than ten thousand foreigners from dozens of countries. Most were the family members of male <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters. Women who had arrived recently were huddled with dirty children next to their possessions in little bundles on the ground. There weren’t enough places to put them. Rahila Osman, a small Uighur woman with two children, came up to ask if I was with an N.G.O. “We’ve been here three nights out in the cold—no blankets, no tent,” she said. She had moved to the Islamic State from China’s western Xinjiang Province, three years ago. Her husband had been killed in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition in Hajin, late last year. Like every other woman I saw, her face was completely covered by a black veil. I asked if she still believed in the caliphate. “I do,” she said. “I want to keep my niqab.”</p><p>The foreign women included both victims and perpetrators. Women were among the earliest targets of <em class="small">ISIS</em>, for slavery and sex trafficking. Many women who ended up in al-Hawl had experienced gender-based violence, according to the <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Al-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf&quot;}" href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Al-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">U.N.

The al-Khansa Battalion was made up largely of foreign women from Europe; the majority of them spoke French. The Aumahat al-Moaminin Battalion was led by Iraqi women. The most lethal unit was the special-operations battalion named after the Prophet Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. Mariam Nasser, a twenty-three-year-old from the Maldives, had two children by two husbands. The first husband was killed and the second was captured. She acknowledged that she had military training. “Every man carried a gun,” she told me. “Every woman, too.”</p><p>Among the people I met, destitution did not deter their loyalty. Salimah Athilayabah, a twenty-two-year-old Chechen from Russia, lived in one of the camp’s few cinderblock facilities covered with a bright-blue tarp roof. It held dozens of women and children, many of them crying. The shelters had no furniture, only mats on the ground; several of them were shared. Athilayabah told me that she had joined <em class="small">ISIS</em> four years ago. “We and everyone like me came to assist God,” she told me. Her husband was killed two years ago, in a coalition air strike. “Every day, we saw death and killing and had fear from the air strikes,” she said. She had finally fled Baghouz with her children, two months earlier. “Still,” she said, “there’s a caliphate in our hearts.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>International agencies are scrambling to provide shelter and food for the <em class="small">ISIS</em> families.

The quid pro quo was Mazloum’s vow to return the Syrians in <em class="small">ISIS</em>—if they had not engaged in major felonies—to their communities. “I met with all the tribes before any campaign for liberation,” Mazloum explained. “I asked them to pull out their people in the tribes from <em class="small">ISIS</em>. And we promised them that anyone who is returning from <em class="small">ISIS</em>, we will give him a credit for his life and will not punish him or treat him badly. Secondly, because we are liberating Raqqa or tribal land, the tribes should give a lot of people to join the S.D.F. This is one reason for our success. We recruited about three thousand people from Raqqa.” For the last brutal months of the war, tribes in Deir Ezzor recruited about ten thousand Arab fighters to join Mazloum’s force.</p><p>Since 2017, when al-Karamah was liberated, a hundred former members of <em class="small">ISIS</em> have gone through rehabilitation. (Another hundred or so died fighting for the Islamic State; many were suicide bombers, the sheikh said.) The survivors were held in a rehab center instead of a prison, most for at least a year. They went through retraining on Islam, but treatment and socialization were just as important. The sheikh showed me a video, on his cell phone, of a graduation ceremony a few days earlier for thirty-eight men. Most were young. All were dressed in sweatsuits. Their heads were shaved.</p><p>“These prisoners will go back to their families and go back to help with the rebuilding of this county,” a tribal elder told the former jihadis. “They will not ruin this country because they have become different. They were imprisoned, but not imprisoned like arrested or humiliated. We raised them and embraced them, the tribal men and leaders, to bring them back to the correct path.” Each of the graduates made his way down a receiving line, shaking hands with each elder.</p><p>Hamoud Ahmad Khalf, thirty-six, was released from the program in September. He fit a common local profile. As a younger man, he had to serve in the Syrian Army. He defected after Daraa, where the Arab Uprising began, in 2011, when the government ordered troops to turn on fellow-Syrians. He went back to al-Karamah and worked for the municipality. When <em class="small">ISIS</em> seized the area, in 2014, he was told to pledge <em>bayat</em>, or allegiance, or lose his job. Because of his military training, he told me, he was recruited for the <em class="small">ISIS</em> police. Like many Syrians, he claimed, he had a low-profile job taking community complaints. “It was the foreigners in <em class="small">ISIS</em> who had all the power,” he said. He was injured in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition, and still had shrapnel in his knee; he relied on crutches to walk.</p><p>Ayman Hussein Essa, a strapping, muscular twenty-five-year-old who could have been a fullback, had graduated from the program five days earlier. He had been in rehabilitation—he called it jail—for a year and a half. He claimed to have repented. “We have paid the price,” he told me, as we sat on the floor of the sheikh’s modest office, lit by a single light bulb. “We were in jail, so I guarantee we will never go back to <em class="small">ISIS</em>, no matter what happens.” Essa left school in the fifth grade. The sheikh said the former <em class="small">ISIS</em> supporter could neither read nor write. “I don’t even have a phone,” Essa told me.</p><p>Both Essa and Khalf were unemployed. “All of those who have been released,” Essa said, “are still waiting for a job opportunity—or any opportunity.” The field for recruitment by a revived version of <em class="small">ISIS</em> or another movement may still be ripe.</p><p>Rehabilitation hasn’t worked for everyone who went through it. The S.D.F. released a thousand captured Syrians who collaborated with <em class="small">ISIS</em>. But dozens simply turned around and went back to <em class="small">ISIS</em>. “We just start step one,” the sheikh told me. “The first step needs to lead to a thousand steps to correct them.” Salar Malla, Mazloum’s aide-de-camp, was more sanguine. “We have two battles to fight—one military and one mentality,” he told me. “We are only winning one of them.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-4 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In mid-February, as <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters started surrendering in droves, President Trump <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/17/politics/donald-trump-isis-fighters-europe-intl/index.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/17/politics/donald-trump-isis-fighters-europe-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a demand to European allies, notably Britain, France, and Germany, to take back more than eight hundred European fighters captured in Syria. “The Caliphate is ready to fall.

The German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/02/18/695831550/european-leaders-reluctant-to-meet-trumps-demands-to-take-back-captive-isis-figh&quot;}" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/18/695831550/european-leaders-reluctant-to-meet-trumps-demands-to-take-back-captive-isis-figh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a> that the Germans in <em class="small">ISIS</em> could be repatriated only if it was certain that they could be tried. Gathering sufficient evidence to detain, try, or imprison any of the <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters is an enormous challenge—unless, as one Western official told me, they were depicted in social-media videos actually beheading people. Britain <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/63164/citizenship-stripping-isis-members-uk-united-kingdom-bangladesh-britain-experience-shamima-begum/&quot;}" href="https://www.justsecurity.org/63164/citizenship-stripping-isis-members-uk-united-kingdom-bangladesh-britain-experience-shamima-begum/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">stripped</a> citizenship from some <em class="small">ISIS</em> members rather than take them back. Other countries aren’t ready to take them in. “We may not be in a position, as each and every one of them comes back to Canada, that we’re at that stage where we can arrest them,” Gilles Michaud, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/5004932/rcmp-preparing-for-return-isis/&quot;}" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/5004932/rcmp-preparing-for-return-isis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a>, in February, in an interview with Global News. France could have a problem repatriating the wives of fighters. Under French law, the women could accuse the government of abducting them from Syria against their will; a judge could be compelled to free them, a French official told me. Some countries, notably Libya and Yemen, have their own wars; there’s no reliable government to take, much less try, their citizens. They also have their own <em class="small">ISIS</em> branches. Other <em class="small">ISIS</em> followers, such as the Uighurs from China and the Chechens from Russia, are persecuted minorities at home—and don’t want to return to their homeland, even if they were offered repatriation.</p><p>Some governments are even reluctant to lock them up at home, for fear that <em class="small">ISIS</em> ideology would <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ctc.usma.edu/the-danger-of-prison-radicalization-in-the-west/&quot;}" href="https://ctc.usma.edu/the-danger-of-prison-radicalization-in-the-west/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">infect</a> others in their jails.

A week before the S.D.F. ousted <em class="small">ISIS</em> fighters from Syrian territory, Mazloum was thinking more about the unintended consequences of the war. “All of those people spent five years of their life serving in the <em class="small">ISIS</em> caliphate,” he told me, at his forward operating base, near the Iraqi border. “All of these people still believe in the <em class="small">ISIS</em> ideology.

The numbers wildly exceeded all expectations, including estimates by U.S. intelligence. The most striking sight at the prison entrance was a mound of human hair lying on the raw concrete floor. Clumps of it—some brown, some graying, most of it greasy or matted—had been shaved off the heads and faces of fighters before they were taken to group cells. “Lice,” one of the guards told me.\n\nThe prison at Dashisha, in eastern Deir Ezzor province, had been an oil-storage facility. In just four days, the compound of modest brick and stucco buildings had been filled with fifteen hundred fighters from countries on four continents, including France, Libya, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq, and the United States, the warden told me.&nbsp;Average-sized rooms had been fitted with metal doors; each cell had a small barred window that I had to stand on my tiptoes to peer through. Each one was crammed, wall to wall, with dozens of men squatting on the floor. The *ISIS*{: .small} fighters wore new T-shirts, in army green, and whatever trousers they had on when they were captured.\n\nAfter five years of war with the Islamic State, the biggest problem for the winners is coping with the losers. The aftermath has produced one of the world’s most perplexing postwar challenges: there are tens of thousands of captured *ISIS*{: .small} members whom no nation wants to repatriate, and the local militia holding them has neither the resources nor the personnel to keep them indefinitely. More than five thousand *ISIS*{: .small} fighters surrendered in the final month of fighting alone. Thousands more were captured earlier in the conflict. They’re dispersed among the new pop-up prisons in northeast Syria. A few hundred of the most severely wounded are in a small hospital, with the foreign fighters crowded in its basement for security. The hospital stench was overwhelming, even through a mask. “Sepsis,” a medic told me. Between December and March, another sixty-three thousand family members of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters—wives enveloped in black niqabs that cover their faces, and bedraggled young children—also poured out of Baghouz, the last *ISIS*{: .small} redoubt in Syria. They’re held separately, most in tents, at a dusty, malodorous camp in al-Hawl that already held ten thousand. The prisons, the hospital, and the camp are all bursting.\n\n“There is nothing else in the world that compares to this unprecedented humanitarian and security situation, which is legally complicated and politically fraught,” a senior State Department official told me. So far, the local Syrian Democratic Forces militia (S.D.F.), the U.S.-led coalition of more than seventy countries, and several international relief agencies have been improvising—total ad-hockery, in the words of a senior U.S. military commander involved in Syria.\n\nJust sorting out the fighters’ real names and nationalities has been messy. Many use noms de guerre. Few have identity papers or passports. Some don’t want to reveal their identities—or their roles with *ISIS*{: .small}. I interviewed three of the prison’s foreign detainees: a middle-aged misfit from Chicago, who was lured to Syria by *ISIS*{: .small} propaganda; a Moroccan who, as an “emir of morality,” acknowledged witnessing at least ten stonings of women accused of adultery and the burning of some forty Yazidi women who were put in a cage, covered with fuel, and set on fire; and a lanky Turk with a prosthetic leg, which was his souvenir from a U.S. air strike. The Turk, Farouk Asser, insisted that he once worked at a pizza parlor in Istanbul and, after joining *ISIS*{: .small}, merely worked as a cook and at a local police station. Every few sentences, the warden muttered, “He’s a liar. He’s a liar.” Asser, according to the warden, was one of the early *ISIS*{: .small} recruiters who helped foreign fighters cross the border from Turkey into Syria.\n\nThe pop-up prisons are combustible politically and vulnerable physically, a dozen U.S. diplomats and military officials told me. *ISIS*{: .small} has its roots in an earlier prison culture—notably in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two infamous prisons in Iraq that were run by the United States between 2003 and 2011. Its founding “caliph,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was&nbsp;[held](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.soufangroup.com\u002Ftsg-intelbrief-from-bucca-to-kobani-the-hybrid-ideology-of-the-islamic-state\u002F)&nbsp;at Camp Bucca for nine months, in 2004. He and other future *ISIS*{: .small} leaders created an embryonic network there.\n\nThe movement grew rapidly after Baghdadi [pronounced](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.understandingwar.org\u002Freport\u002Fal-qaeda-iraq-resurgent), in 2012,&nbsp;that&nbsp;its [first priority](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.prisonlegalnews.org\u002Fnews\u002F2013\u002Fsep\u002F15\u002F500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq\u002F)&nbsp;should be “releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.” Over the next year, Al Qaeda in Iraq attacked eight prisons. In July, 2013, more than five hundred inmates—including top Al Qaeda leaders&nbsp;[sentenced](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.prisonlegalnews.org\u002Fnews\u002F2013\u002Fsep\u002F15\u002F500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq\u002F)&nbsp;to death—were freed in final simultaneous&nbsp;[attacks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Farticle\u002Fus-iraq-violence-alqaeda\u002Fal-qaeda-says-it-freed-500-inmates-in-iraq-jail-break-idUSBRE96M0C720130723)&nbsp;on two prisons, including Abu Ghraib. Many inmates escaped into Syria, where Al Qaeda in Iraq evolved into the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The prison raids—the so-called breaking-the-walls campaign—provided the first evidence that Baghdadi’s men were “a professional military force capable of planning, training, resourcing and executing synchronized and complex attacks,” as the Institute for the Study of War reported. By 2014, *ISIS*{: .small} had enough men to blitz across Syria and Iraq, and captured territory the size of Britain. Despite its recent loss of terrain in both Syria and Iraq, U.S. military and S.D.F. officials told me, *ISIS*{: .small} underground cells still have those basic capabilities. Prison breaks, they added, are almost certain to be one way that the group tries to rebuild.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4df8c546f8f3881e5c611]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe first prisoner I interviewed at Dashisha was Lirim Sulejmani, the American from Chicago. He had surrendered two weeks earlier. He was balding and thin; he told me that he was forty-three. His arms were awkwardly handcuffed behind him with thin plastic bands. He seemed detached, and both physically and psychologically defeated. We sat on the floor of the prison’s makeshift office, which had no furniture. His wife and three children were probably at the al-Hawl camp, he said, but he wasn’t sure. He was sucked into *ISIS*{: .small} by its utopian promises. “I wanted to make hegira,” he told me. “I wanted to live under Sharia,” or Islamic law. Hegira, traditionally used to describe the Prophet Muhammad’s&nbsp;[migration](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.britannica.com\u002Fevent\u002FHijrah-Islam)&nbsp;from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution, had become an *ISIS*{: .small} buzzword—and&nbsp;a [recruiting tool](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.themontrealreview.com\u002F2009\u002FHijra-before-ISIS.php). The pull is as powerful as the idea of jihad. After Baghdadi declared the Islamic State, in 2014, he appealed to Muslims worldwide to make hegira, to re-create a country that ruled as in the Prophet’s time, fourteen centuries ago.\n\nUp to three hundred Americans attempted to join or succeeded in joining jihadist movements in Syria and Iraq, according to a&nbsp;2014 [report](https:\u002F\u002Fextremism.gwu.edu\u002Fsites\u002Fg\u002Ffiles\u002Fzaxdzs2191\u002Ff\u002FTravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf)&nbsp;by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. Dozens were arrested before they left the United States.&nbsp;[More than a hundred](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thedailybeast.com\u002Fhagel-100-americans-have-joined-isis)&nbsp;ended up fighting with *ISIS*{: .small}, according to Chuck Hagel, who was then the Defense Secretary. A&nbsp;[few](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fsections\u002Fparallels\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F05\u002F583407221\u002Famericans-in-isis-some-300-tried-to-join-12-have-returned-to-u-s)&nbsp;rose to leadership positions. The Americans tended to fall into&nbsp;[three categories](https:\u002F\u002Fextremism.gwu.edu\u002Fsites\u002Fg\u002Ffiles\u002Fzaxdzs2191\u002Ff\u002FTravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf): the early pioneers and ideologues who brought skills with them; the “networked travelers” who had personal connections with others in *ISIS*{: .small}; and the loners, lured by propaganda, who made their own way to the Islamic State. When *ISIS*{: .small} lost its last piece of territory, on March 23rd, fewer than two dozen Americans—fighters and family members—were found among the tens of thousands, U.S. officials told me. Sulejmani’s family accounted for five of them.&nbsp;Many other Americans are presumed to have died, possibly in U.S. air strikes.\n\nSulejmani seemed to fit the loner category. He reminded me of misfits I’ve interviewed in war zones well beyond the Middle East, including unemployed Brits who became mercenaries in Angola and American Vietnam veterans who signed up to fight in the Rhodesian civil war. Sulejmani told a woeful life story. He was born in Kosovo but fled, with his mother and siblings, during Serbia’s&nbsp;[war](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pbs.org\u002Fwgbh\u002Fpages\u002Ffrontline\u002Fshows\u002Fkosovo\u002Fetc\u002Fcron.html)&nbsp;there, two decades ago. He ended up in Northbrook, a Chicago suburb. He had limited training; a series of jobs didn’t seem to last long. He married a woman of Polish descent. One of their daughters died young. He later looked for work in Canada, where his wife had contacts. *ISIS*{: .small} lured him more than three years ago, with promises of an engineering job and housing—and a community where he would fit in. His family made their way to Syria through Turkey. He was dispatched briefly to Iraq, for military and religious training. He learned to operate an AK-47 automatic rifle but claimed he never fought, even though he stayed with *ISIS*{: .small} as it retreated from Raqqa, the Islamic State capital, to towns and villages and, finally, a farming hamlet on the Euphrates River. In the end, U.S. officials told me, the *ISIS*{: .small} loyalists in Baghouz were the most hardcore.\n\n“I shot about twenty bullets when I was doing the training in Mosul. And I shot one bullet in a house, by accident, in the ceiling. That’s as much fighting as I did,” Sulejmani insisted. “I carried the gun since the first day when I came to Dar al-Islamiyyah [House of Islam] until I left Baghouz. Towards the end it was rusted, but my goal wasn’t to come fight. It was making&nbsp;hegira. I was pushed a certain way, which I went. I liked to give it a try. It just didn’t work.” He shrugged.\n\nAmong the *ISIS*{: .small} fighters, the truth is often ephemeral. Many of them lie either to their captors or to themselves, a senior U.S. commander involved in Syria told me. Sulejmani recounted having a hard time fitting in, refusing to go to the front lines because of back problems, scrounging to feed his family, and spending time with a group of Albanians who joined *ISIS*{: .small}.\n\nI asked if he still supported Baghdadi, who appeared only once in public, to declare the Islamic State, in 2014. Since then, the self-appointed caliph has issued only a handful of audio messages. The last one was in August, when he&nbsp;[admitted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2018\u002F08\u002F22\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fisis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-recording\u002Findex.html)&nbsp;that *ISIS*{: .small} was losing ground. “Right now, to be honest with you, and you don’t have to write this down, for me he’s been dead for over two years,” Sulejmani said. “I did not hear from him. Do you know if he’s alive?” When I said I didn’t, he mused, “It’s been a disappointment. It’s been a betrayal of, the way I see it, for people that were called to make hegira.” U.S. and S.D.F. officials believe that Baghdadi may be in the desert region along the Iraq-Syria border.\n\nIf given the chance to live in another caliphate, I asked Sulejmani, would he do it again? “I would,” he said. “For me, at this point, everything is religious. This world, sooner or later, will end, like it ends for everybody. For me, it’s important what comes after. I had a mother—she passed away. Father, passed away. Had a daughter—she passed away. We all die. My belief is that we’re put in this world to worship Allah. So, *Inshallah* [God willing], there will be Jinah, or paradise, after it.” So, I asked, why hadn’t he become a martyr, or *shahid*, in the language of jihadists? “I like life,” he said. “I did not come to die here. I came to live under Sharia. I mean, it was open enrollment.”\n\nAfter the mass surrender of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters and families, I asked, will there be enough people who believe that creating a new caliphate is still worth it?\n\n“I believe so,” he replied.\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe camp for the dregs of *ISIS*{: .small} in al-Hawl was one of the dreariest places I’ve seen over forty years in the Middle East. On the morning I visited, it was chaotic and cacophonous. Litter was everywhere. The whole area stank. Trucks were still hauling people in, even though a U.N. agency had&nbsp;[declared](https:\u002F\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Fsites\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Ffiles\u002Fresources\u002FAl-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf)&nbsp;the camp “extremely above capacity.” More than seventy-three thousand people were living in an area of less than four square kilometres.\n\nThey were divided into two groups, held behind high chain-link fences that were topped with barbed wire. Iraqis and Syrians, who accounted for more than eighty per cent, were on one side. I went into the “annex,” on the other side, which held more than ten thousand foreigners from dozens of countries. Most were the family members of male *ISIS*{: .small} fighters. Women who had arrived recently were huddled with dirty children next to their possessions in little bundles on the ground. There weren’t enough places to put them. Rahila Osman, a small Uighur woman with two children, came up to ask if I was with an N.G.O. “We’ve been here three nights out in the cold—no blankets, no tent,” she said. She had moved to the Islamic State from China’s western Xinjiang Province, three years ago. Her husband had been killed in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition in Hajin, late last year. Like every other woman I saw, her face was completely covered by a black veil. I asked if she still believed in the caliphate. “I do,” she said. “I want to keep my niqab.”\n\nThe foreign women included both victims and perpetrators. Women were among the earliest targets of *ISIS*{: .small}, for slavery and sex trafficking. Many women who ended up in al-Hawl had experienced gender-based violence, according to the [U.N. Population Fund](https:\u002F\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Fsites\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Ffiles\u002Fresources\u002FAl-Hol%20Camp%20Situation%20Report-%20Update%204%2C%2001%20April%202019%20-%20%5BUNFPA%2C%20Syria%5D.pdf)*.*{: .small}&nbsp;A “high number” of adolescent girls were already mothers, or pregnant; some had been child brides. Many women had children by two or three men, because their husbands were killed fighting for the Islamic State, so they wed again, voluntarily or involuntarily, to survive, S.D.F. and U.S. officials told me.\n\nYet thousands of women in al-Hawl were also “suspected foreign fighters,” the U.N. reported. Women played&nbsp;[valuable roles](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002F20\u002Fopinion\u002Fislamic-state-female-fighters.html)&nbsp;in *ISIS*{: .small}, ranging from suicide bombers to spies, morality police, and assassins. They were among “the most brutal enforcers,” according to a report by the&nbsp;[International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.icsve.org\u002Fthe-operational-ranks-and-roles-of-female-isis-operatives-from-assassins-and-morality-police-to-spies-and-suicide-bombers\u002F). *ISIS*{: .small} had all-female units. The al-Khansa Battalion was made up largely of foreign women from Europe; the majority of them spoke French. The Aumahat al-Moaminin Battalion was led by Iraqi women. The most lethal unit was the special-operations battalion named after the Prophet Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. Mariam Nasser, a twenty-three-year-old from the Maldives, had two children by two husbands. The first husband was killed and the second was captured. She acknowledged that she had military training. “Every man carried a gun,” she told me. “Every woman, too.”\n\nAmong the people I met, destitution did not deter their loyalty. Salimah Athilayabah, a twenty-two-year-old Chechen from Russia, lived in one of the camp’s few cinderblock facilities covered with a bright-blue tarp roof. It held dozens of women and children, many of them crying. The shelters had no furniture, only mats on the ground; several of them were shared. Athilayabah told me that she had joined *ISIS*{: .small} four years ago. “We and everyone like me came to assist God,” she told me. Her husband was killed two years ago, in a coalition air strike. “Every day, we saw death and killing and had fear from the air strikes,” she said. She had finally fled Baghouz with her children, two months earlier. “Still,” she said, “there’s a caliphate in our hearts.”\n\nInternational agencies are scrambling to provide shelter and food for the *ISIS*{: .small} families. Without a longer-term plan, however, U.S. officials fear that the camp, like the prisons in Iraq, will become an ecosystem that perpetuates *ISIS*{: .small} ideology—and just breeds another generation.&nbsp;[Sixty-five per cent](https:\u002F\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Freport\u002Fsyrian-arab-republic\u002Fsyria-humanitarian-response-al-hol-camp-situation-report-no-1)&nbsp;of al-Hawl’s residents—some forty-eight thousand—are under the age of eighteen. Almost a quarter of them are under the age of five.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5cb50da73adeca2db6bf280e]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn their final days, the Islamic State’s fighters and families surrendered to the S.D.F. The militia of Kurds and Arabs, which is backed by the U.S.-led coalition, has absorbed ninety per cent of the costs of converting, staffing, and protecting the makeshift prisons and providing for the prisoners, General Mazloum Kobani Abdi told me. But it is not a state, and it has neither the resources nor the institutions to cope long-term with the aftermath of the Islamic State. The coalition that pressed the S.D.F. to fight *ISIS*{: .small} has provided little financial or logistical help now that it has succeeded. “We are cutting the costs from the salaries of our soldiers,” Mazloum said. The situation is not sustainable.\n\nTo deal with the thousands of Syrians in *ISIS*{: .small}, Mazloum launched a makeshift rehabilitation program. The pilot project was in al-Karamah, a town near Raqqa and a bastion for the kind of ultra-conservative Salafis who joined *ISIS*{: .small}. I saw many men on its streets wearing short thobes, with hems above their ankles, a telltale sign of devout Muslims who emulate practices from the Prophet Muhammad’s time. “This region is agricultural and tribal and very traditional,” [Mohammed al-Zeeb](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.hawarnews.com\u002Fen\u002Fhaber\u002Fsheikh-of-clan-daesh-ideas-danger-to-our-regions-states-must-restore-their-citizens-h8212.html), a sheikh in the Afadla tribe, one of [the largest](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtoninstitute.org\u002Fuploads\u002FDocuments\u002Fpubs\u002FPolicyNote39-Raqqa.pdf) around Raqqa, told me. He heads the local rehabilitation program. “Most of our people were with *ISIS*{: .small}, frankly.” Some four hundred men from al-Karamah joined the jihadi movement.\n\nThe promise of rehabilitation was a key building block in beating *ISIS*{: .small}. Mazloum’s original militia was Kurdish. To take the fight into Syria’s Arab heartland, he had to mobilize tribal support and thousands of Arab troops. The quid pro quo was Mazloum’s vow to return the Syrians in *ISIS*{: .small}—if they had not engaged in major felonies—to their communities. “I met with all the tribes before any campaign for liberation,” Mazloum explained. “I asked them to pull out their people in the tribes from *ISIS*{: .small}. And we promised them that anyone who is returning from *ISIS*{: .small}, we will give him a credit for his life and will not punish him or treat him badly. Secondly, because we are liberating Raqqa or tribal land, the tribes should give a lot of people to join the S.D.F. This is one reason for our success. We recruited about three thousand people from Raqqa.” For the last brutal months of the war, tribes in Deir Ezzor recruited about ten thousand Arab fighters to join Mazloum’s force.\n\nSince 2017, when al-Karamah was liberated, a hundred former members of *ISIS*{: .small} have gone through rehabilitation. (Another hundred or so died fighting for the Islamic State; many were suicide bombers, the sheikh said.) The survivors were held in a rehab center instead of a prison, most for at least a year. They went through retraining on Islam, but treatment and socialization were just as important. The sheikh showed me a video, on his cell phone, of a graduation ceremony a few days earlier for thirty-eight men. Most were young. All were dressed in sweatsuits. Their heads were shaved.\n\n“These prisoners will go back to their families and go back to help with the rebuilding of this county,” a tribal elder told the former jihadis. “They will not ruin this country because they have become different. They were imprisoned, but not imprisoned like arrested or humiliated. We raised them and embraced them, the tribal men and leaders, to bring them back to the correct path.” Each of the graduates made his way down a receiving line, shaking hands with each elder.\n\nHamoud Ahmad Khalf, thirty-six, was released from the program in September. He fit a common local profile. As a younger man, he had to serve in the Syrian Army. He defected after Daraa, where the Arab Uprising began, in 2011, when the government ordered troops to turn on fellow-Syrians. He went back to al-Karamah and worked for the municipality. When *ISIS*{: .small} seized the area, in 2014, he was told to pledge *bayat*, or allegiance, or lose his job. Because of his military training, he told me, he was recruited for the *ISIS*{: .small} police. Like many Syrians, he claimed, he had a low-profile job taking community complaints. “It was the foreigners in *ISIS*{: .small} who had all the power,” he said. He was injured in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition, and still had shrapnel in his knee; he relied on crutches to walk.\n\nAyman Hussein Essa, a strapping, muscular twenty-five-year-old who could have been a fullback, had graduated from the program five days earlier. He had been in rehabilitation—he called it jail—for a year and a half. He claimed to have repented. “We have paid the price,” he told me, as we sat on the floor of the sheikh’s modest office, lit by a single light bulb. “We were in jail, so I guarantee we will never go back to *ISIS*{: .small}, no matter what happens.” Essa left school in the fifth grade. The sheikh said the former *ISIS*{: .small} supporter could neither read nor write. “I don’t even have a phone,” Essa told me.\n\nBoth Essa and Khalf were unemployed. “All of those who have been released,” Essa said, “are still waiting for a job opportunity—or any opportunity.” The field for recruitment by a revived version of *ISIS*{: .small} or another movement may still be ripe.\n\nRehabilitation hasn’t worked for everyone who went through it. The S.D.F. released a thousand captured Syrians who collaborated with *ISIS*{: .small}. But dozens simply turned around and went back to *ISIS*{: .small}. “We just start step one,” the sheikh told me. “The first step needs to lead to a thousand steps to correct them.” Salar Malla, Mazloum’s aide-de-camp, was more sanguine. “We have two battles to fight—one military and one mentality,” he told me. “We are only winning one of them.”\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn mid-February, as *ISIS*{: .small} fighters started surrendering in droves, President Trump&nbsp;[tweeted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002F17\u002Fpolitics\u002Fdonald-trump-isis-fighters-europe-intl\u002Findex.html)&nbsp;a demand to European allies, notably Britain, France, and Germany, to take back more than eight hundred European fighters captured in Syria. “The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,” he wrote. “Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory\\!”\n\nCitizens of more than eighty nations have joined *ISIS*{: .small}, but few of their governments have&nbsp;[stepped up](https:\u002F\u002Freliefweb.int\u002Freport\u002Fsyrian-arab-republic\u002Fsyria-humanitarian-response-al-hol-camp-situation-report-no-1)&nbsp;to take them back. “The United States will continue to repatriate and, when appropriate, prosecute its citizens, as we have done in the past,” a State Department official told me. Kazakhstan, Macedonia, and Morocco announced repatriations of some of their citizens. Iraq has pledged to eventually take back its citizens, although at least [thirty-one thousand](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.france24.com\u002Fen\u002F20190411-syria-kurds-say-deal-made-31000-displaced-iraqis-go-home?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ebb%2004.12.19&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) are in Syria.

Iraq has also been widely criticized for summary justice of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters and supporters. Last year, the *Times* reported on the&nbsp;[trial](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F04\u002F17\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Firaq-isis-trials.html)&nbsp;of a forty-two-year-old Turkish housewife who had travelled to the Islamic State with her husband. It lasted ten minutes; she was sentenced to death by hanging. In the course of the next two hours, thirteen other women were sentenced to die.\n\nMost other countries are reluctant. The German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas,&nbsp;[said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2019\u002F02\u002F18\u002F695831550\u002Feuropean-leaders-reluctant-to-meet-trumps-demands-to-take-back-captive-isis-figh)&nbsp;that the Germans in *ISIS*{: .small} could be repatriated only if it was certain that they could be tried. Gathering sufficient evidence to detain, try, or imprison any of the *ISIS*{: .small} fighters is an enormous challenge—unless, as one Western official told me, they were depicted in social-media videos actually beheading people. Britain&nbsp;[stripped](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.justsecurity.org\u002F63164\u002Fcitizenship-stripping-isis-members-uk-united-kingdom-bangladesh-britain-experience-shamima-begum\u002F)&nbsp;citizenship from some *ISIS*{: .small} members rather than take them back. Other countries aren’t ready to take them in. “We may not be in a position, as each and every one of them comes back to Canada, that we’re at that stage where we can arrest them,” Gilles Michaud, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,&nbsp;[said](https:\u002F\u002Fglobalnews.ca\u002Fnews\u002F5004932\u002Frcmp-preparing-for-return-isis\u002F), in February, in an interview with Global News. France could have a problem repatriating the wives of fighters. Under French law, the women could accuse the government of abducting them from Syria against their will; a judge could be compelled to free them, a French official told me. Some countries, notably Libya and Yemen, have their own wars; there’s no reliable government to take, much less try, their citizens. They also have their own *ISIS*{: .small} branches. Other *ISIS*{: .small} followers, such as the Uighurs from China and the Chechens from Russia, are persecuted minorities at home—and don’t want to return to their homeland, even if they were offered repatriation.\n\nSome governments are even reluctant to lock them up at home, for fear that *ISIS*{: .small} ideology would&nbsp;[infect](https:\u002F\u002Fctc.usma.edu\u002Fthe-danger-of-prison-radicalization-in-the-west\u002F)&nbsp;others in their jails. Richard Reid converted to Islam in a British prison. In 2001, he tried to ignite an explosive hidden in his sneaker on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami. The so-called&nbsp;[shoe bomber](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2013\u002F03\u002F25\u002Fus\u002Frichard-reid-fast-facts\u002Findex.html)&nbsp;is now in a maximum-security prison in Colorado, where he is prohibited from praying with other inmates.\n\nAs governments balked at repatriation, the S.D.F.&nbsp;[appealed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.militarytimes.com\u002Fflashpoints\u002F2019\u002F03\u002F25\u002Fus-backed-kurdish-fighters-want-international-tribunal-for-isis-detainees\u002F)&nbsp;last month for the creation of an international tribunal “for justice to take its course.” So far, there’s been little interest in that option, either. A week before the S.D.F. ousted *ISIS*{: .small} fighters from Syrian territory, Mazloum was thinking more about the unintended consequences of the war. “All of those people spent five years of their life serving in the *ISIS*{: .small} caliphate,” he told me, at his forward operating base, near the Iraqi border. “All of these people still believe in the *ISIS*{: .small} ideology. We are forced to solve this problem with the countries that they belong to. If we don’t, it’s going to be dangerous for all of our futures.”\n\n","articleSection":"dispatch","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Robin Wright","sameAs":"https:\u002F\u002Fthe-new-yorker.com\u002Fcontributor\u002Frobin-wright\u002F"}],"dateModified":"2019-04-19T15:38:09.149","datePublished":"2019-04-16T05:00:00.000","headline":"The Dangerous Dregs of ISIS","image":["https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F2:1\u002Fw_2560,h_1280,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F2:2\u002Fw_1701,h_1701,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F16:9\u002Fw_2560,h_1439,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F4:3\u002Fw_2267,h_1700,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1701,h_1701,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg"],"keywords":["dispatch","syria","islamic state","isis"],"thumbnailUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1701,h_1701,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdispatch\u002Fthe-dangerous-dregs-of-isis","isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"The New Yorker"},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"hasPart":[{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":"False","cssSelector":".paywall"}],"alternativeHeadline":"Robin Wright reports on the aftermath of the collapse of ISIS in Syria and speaks with surrendered Islamic State fighters in makeshift camps.","description":"Robin Wright reports on the aftermath of the collapse of ISIS in Syria and speaks with surrendered Islamic State fighters in makeshift camps.","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdispatch\u002Fthe-dangerous-dregs-of-isis"},"publisher":{"@context":"https:\u002F\u002Fschema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"The New Yorker","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fstatic\u002Ftny\u002Fassets\u002Flogo-seo.png","width":"500px","height":"117px"},"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com"}},"head.contentID":"5caf836f9cf262302c4a0e77","head.pageType":"article","head.photos":{"image-16-9":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F16:9\u002Fw_1000,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg","image-1-1":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5cb4d8faaaf4e60f45f6a863\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1000,c_limit\u002FWright-ISIS_01.jpg"},"linkBannerData":{"hed":"","dek":"","image":{},"links":[],"tracking":""},"navigation":{"aboutText":"The writers you love.

Its caliphate, daringly declared from the pulpit of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, in Iraq, in 2014, had been the size of Britain, ruled eight million people, lured recruits from eighty countries, and threatened to redraw the map of the Middle East. It ended, in the Syrian farming hamlet of Baghouz, as little more than a junk yard about the [size](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2019\u002F03\u002F23\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fisis-syria-caliphate.html) of Central Park, filled with burnt-out vehicles and dilapidated tents. Tens of thousands of *ISIS*{:.small} loyalists, both fighters and their families, opted to surrender—and face life in crammed prisons and dreary detention camps—rather than become martyrs in *ISIS*{:.small}’s promised paradise.\n\nThe dangers are far from over. *ISIS*{:.small} has sleeper agents. “There are thousands,” General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the reclusive politician turned commander who led the campaign against *ISIS*{:.small} in Syria, told me, when I travelled through the former caliphate last month.

More than a dozen American diplomats and military officials involved in Syria told me the same thing. The campaign was distinct from the counterpart operation in neighboring Iraq, where the United States coördinated with a friendly government, retrained its conventional Army, provided sophisticated weaponry, established a headquarters for a coalition of seventy-four countries, and had legal status granted by parliament.\n\n[The campaign in Syria](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F11\u002F06\u002Fdark-victory-in-raqqa) liberated roughly the same amount of territory. But it relied on an unlikely partnership between élite U.S. Special Forces teams and a scrappy local militia led by Mazloum, a middle-aged Kurdish rebel whose face has been weathered by years of conflict and five stints in Syrian prisons. They all operated in defiance of the Syrian government and its Russian, Iranian, and Hezbollah allies deployed nearby. Their mission was shrouded in secrecy. American troops wore no identifying insignias, ranks, or names on their uniforms. The Syrian fighters knew only the first names of the Americans, including the commander. Yet they established an unusual level of trust. The U.S.-led international coalition provided air cover, but it depended on the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to protect their troops on the ground.\n\nTogether, they [seized](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.defense.gov\u002Fexplore\u002Fstory\u002FArticle\u002F1718356\u002F5-things-to-know-about-the-fight-against-isis-in-syria\u002F) twenty thousand square miles in northern Syria, a dusty region of crops, pastures, and oil fields that reminded me of Oklahoma. When I drove around Raqqa, the former *ISIS*{:.small} capital, little girls with ponytails and pastel backpacks were headed to school—after years of being banned from education or even from leaving home. Women, their faces uncovered, strolled to the street markets rising amid the rubble, much of it created by U.S. air strikes. Small groups of men sat curbside, sipping their morning tea and smoking, another practice that was banned under *ISIS*{:.small}. At several shops, workers were pounding twisted construction rods—giant metal tumbleweeds pulled from bombed-out buildings—to flatten them, for use in reconstruction. Spring lambs, small and pristine white, nibbled along the roadsides. \n\nIn Washington and other Western capitals, the territorial defeat of *ISIS*{:.small}, which for years was considered the greatest threat to global security, will almost certainly be studied as a model for future counterterrorism operations. “The S.D.F. is the best unconventional partner force we’ve ever had, anywhere,” Brett McGurk, the former lead coördinator of the campaign against *ISIS*{:.small}, who is now a fellow at Stanford, told me. “The S.D.F. in effect conquered one-third of Syria, once the heart of the *ISIS*{:.small} caliphate, with very low costs for the United States.” Mazloum, who is on Turkey’s most-wanted list, evolved into one of the most important U.S. allies in the Middle East.\n\nThe collaboration—which deepened over [three phases](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.inherentresolve.mil\u002Fcampaign\u002F)—is an epic with twists, tragedies, and, ultimately, betrayal at an enormous cost to America’s allies in Syria. Eleven thousand Kurdish fighters have died since 2014. The Americans have lost eight. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5ca505b727523f08d4ed329a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe alliance was seeded in August, 2014, a month after *ISIS*{:.small} [declared](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2014\u002F07\u002F06\u002Fworld\u002Fasia\u002Firaq-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-sermon-video.html) its caliphate and a week after a lightning *ISIS*{:.small} offensive began in Iraq.

However much Obama wanted to avoid another Middle East war, the United States had just taken on *ISIS*{:.small}. The question was what to do next.\n\nThe crisis on Mount Sinjar eased after Kurdish fighters—including Mazloum’s militia—created an escape route for the Yazidis into Syria. Pentagon officials took note. The United States had struggled to identify or create a credible rebel force in Syria. Mazloum had a standing militia that proved it could fight, even with only vintage weapons. Between 2011 and 2013, without foreign support, it had pushed Syrian government forces out of northern Kurdish towns during the Arab Spring and fought off an Al Qaeda franchise that moved on Kurdish turf. A senior U.S. military official looked for an introduction. The United States was not the only country interested in the Kurdish general, U.S. officials told me. On the morning of August 18th, Mazloum met Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force, the most élite unit in the Revolutionary Guard. The Iranians had rushed in—faster than the Americans did—to help the Iraqis hold off the *ISIS*{:.small} juggernaut. Hours after meeting the Iranian commander, Mazloum rendezvoused with the American official in Suleimaniya, a Kurdish city in northern Iraq.\n\nMazloum came with complications, however. His original militia was the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G.; it was Kurdish. Its political arm sought autonomy in Syria. Many of its members, including Mazloum, had trained with a militant Turkish movement—the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K.—which was waging an insurgency to win autonomy in Turkey. The P.K.K. was on the U.S. and Turkish lists of terrorist organizations. Its leader, Abdullah Öcalan, had lived in the Kurdish region of Syria for two decades before he was imprisoned, in 1999, in Turkey. Öcalan was a personal friend of Mazloum’s; they were once photographed swimming together in the Euphrates River. “For a period of time, I served in P.K.K. ranks,” Mazloum told me. “Öcalan was working here, and the people here had loyalty to him. But the Y.P.G. is not a terrorist organization. Always the Turks like to paint everything in Syria like it’s the P.K.K., but this is not true.” Yet Mazloum has relatives who are still with the P.K.K. Huge posters of Öcalan adorned every Y.P.G. and S.D.F. base I visited. \n\nThe American overture to Mazloum had both conditions and limits, senior U.S. officials told me. The U.S.-backed coalition could provide strategic advice but no major arms, because of the Y.P.G.’s history. If the Kurds took territory from *ISIS*{:.small}, they had to include other ethnic or religious groups, notably Arabs and Christians, in setting up governance and security. The Kurdish militia had to accept that its region would remain part of Syria—and not try to break away into an independent Kurdish state. And they had to vow not to attack Turkish interests. If any of those terms were violated, the U.S. would walk away. Mazloum opted for an alliance with the Americans. “At the time, *ISIS*{:.small} was getting stronger every day,” he told me. “We were at capacity just stemming the tide and protecting our area. The United States intervening in this fight changed the balance of power between us and *ISIS*{:.small}.”\n\nThe makeshift alliance was tested a few weeks later, when *ISIS*{:.small} invaded Kobani, a strategic town built as a whistle stop on the Berlin-Baghdad railway. Kobani is Mazloum’s home town. He incorporated it into the nom de guerre by which he is known. (His real [name](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.al-monitor.com\u002Fpulse\u002Foriginals\u002F2019\u002F03\u002Fsyria-kurdish-mazlum-kobane-damascus-talks-assad-russia.html) is Ferhat Abdi Şahin.) *ISIS*{:.small} seized [sixty per cent](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.airforcemag.com\u002FMagazineArchive\u002FPages\u002F2018\u002FOctober%202018\u002FThe-Siege-of-Kobani.aspx) of the city, forcing most of its forty thousand residents to flee across the border to Turkey. In October, 2014, I [watched](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2014\u002F12\u002F08\u002Fvortex) from a nearby hill in Turkey as *ISIS*{:.small} pounded Kobani with thundering artillery. *ISIS*{:.small}’s black-and-white flag billowed on the horizon.\n\nKobani proved to be a turning point for Washington. The Obama Administration expanded its intervention, from Iraq into Syria, with [air strikes](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2014\u002F09\u002F23\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fus-and-allies-hit-isis-targets-in-syria.html) on *ISIS*{:.small} forces in Kobani. Among the targets was Mazloum’s home. *ISIS*{:.small} had seized it as an operations center. Mazloum approved the U.S. decision to destroy it, a senior U.S. official told me. The marriage of American air power and a tough local militia on the ground—dubbed the “[hammer and anvil](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.foreignaffairs.com\u002Farticles\u002Firaq\u002F2015-01-02\u002Fhammer-and-anvil)” strategy—succeeded. After a gruelling five-month battle, *ISIS*{:.small} experienced its [first defeat](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fvictory-kobani). In January, 2015, Mazloum’s militia hoisted its yellow banner atop Kobani’s highest hill; fighters, both male and female, danced by firelight amid the city’s bombed-out ruins. Kobani, where more than [thirteen hundred Kurds](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F11\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fsyria-kobani-ruins.html) perished, still ranks as the longest, deadliest, and most vicious battle with the Islamic State. It later became a base used by U.S. Special Forces and a small team of U.S. diplomats. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe partnership deepened in the second phase. In April, 2015, the U.S. approached Mazloum about leading the war against *ISIS*{:.small} beyond Syria’s Kurdish regions. The Obama Administration was on the verge of abandoning a separate Pentagon program to train fifteen thousand Syrians in Turkey and Jordan. Five hundred million dollars had been allocated for the program; ultimately, fifty million dollars were spent, and it produced only a handful of trained soldiers. “I wasn’t happy with the early efforts,” Secretary of Defense Ash Carter [admitted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2015\u002F10\u002F10\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fpentagon-program-islamic-state-syria.html?module=inline) at a news conference in Washington at the time. “So we have devised a number of different approaches.” They relied heavily on Mazloum’s militia.\n\nThe Kurdish general was initially hesitant about fighting in Syria’s Arab heartland, U.S. officials told me. Kurds and Arabs have a troubled history. Thousands of Sunnis from conservative local Arab tribes had joined *ISIS*{:.small}. To liberate those areas, Mazloum told his U.S. counterparts, he needed to recruit Arab tribal sheikhs to support him and form an Arab wing of his militia. A purely Kurdish militia wouldn’t be welcome, he warned. In turn, Mazloum wanted the U.S. to train the Arab fighters and provide them with weapons that he did not have—and that his own fighters could not receive because of the Y.P.G.’s controversial status. The U.S. agreed. The Y.P.G. merged with new Arab, Turkmen, and Assyrian wings into the new Syrian Democratic Forces. In October, 2015, the first U.S. team was deployed in Syria to train and advise them.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5ca505b6f676bc232b55cae2]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn a grinding campaign that often involved house-to-house fighting and claimed the lives of thousands of S.D.F. members, the group slowly seized territory—Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, al-Shaddadi, and Manbij—that cut off land routes for foreign fighters and supplies coming through Turkey. Thousands of U.S. and coalition air strikes demolished *ISIS*{:.small} offices, barracks, convoys, checkpoints, and arms depots. They picked off *ISIS*{:.small} leaders, including [Abu Muhammad al-Adnani](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fabu-muhammad-al-adnani-the-voice-of-isis-is-dead), the social-media mastermind of *ISIS*{:.small}, and [Jihadi John](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2016\u002F01\u002F20\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fisis-magazine-confirms-jihadi-john-was-killed.html), the executioner with a British accent who beheaded, on video, the Americans journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, three Western aid workers, and two Japanese reporters. The Obama Administration also quietly deployed hundreds of additional U.S. Special Forces to Syria. Mazloum, who had kept a low profile after multiple assassination attempts against him, began hosting top Pentagon brass and congressional delegations, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who travelled to liberated corners of Syria.\n\nAs S.D.F. capabilities expanded, the U.S. asked Mazloum to take on the biggest challenge yet: liberating Raqqa, the *ISIS*{:.small} capital, a city with a quarter of a million residents. Implicit in the U.S. request was an awareness that the fighting was likely to be long, intense, and costly in human life. A senior U.S. official who worked with Mazloum remembered the conversation. “Whatever we laid out to him, what we wanted the campaign to be, he looked at me and said, ‘I trust your judgment. We would probably, for other reasons, do this a little bit differently. I understand your logic, and I agree.’&nbsp;” Mazloum noted, however, that he would need more sophisticated arms for urban warfare. This time, he said, the Kurdish Y.P.G. fighters in the S.D.F. would have to receive U.S. arms, as well.\n\nDuring the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump had repeatedly blasted the Obama Administration for not doing enough to defeat *ISIS*{:.small}. He vowed to do more—much more. “I would bomb the shit out of them,” he [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2017\u002F04\u002F13\u002Fpolitics\u002Fmoab-trump-afghanistan\u002Findex.html) at one rally. “I’d just bomb those suckers.

More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F. fighters—Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians—were killed in Raqqa.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5ca505b630f72b6134fd07da]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe joint campaign faced sporadic challenges—menacing warnings from the Syrian government, the deployment of Russian mercenaries nearby, and constant criticism from Turkey. In November, 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan [called](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fworld\u002Fnational-security\u002Ftrump-tells-turkish-president-us-will-stop-arming-kurds-in-syria\u002F2017\u002F11\u002F24\u002F61548936-d148-11e7-a1a3-0d1e45a6de3d_story.html?utm_term=.05901574f558) Trump, who was in Florida, preparing for a round of golf with Tiger Woods, to complain about U.S. arms flowing to Kurds in the S.D.F., which Erdoğan considered a terrorist group. Surprising his aides, Trump [promised](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fworld\u002Fnational-security\u002Ftrump-tells-turkish-president-us-will-stop-arming-kurds-in-syria\u002F2017\u002F11\u002F24\u002F61548936-d148-11e7-a1a3-0d1e45a6de3d_story.html?utm_term=.ce482f43fd2d) to stop the shipments. Former U.S. officials familiar with the call told me that the President did not fully grasp the details, players, or regional politics of his own decision to arm the Kurds—or that it was the decision that enabled the Kurdish-led S.D.F. to liberate Raqqa. U.S. officials had to convince Trump that the weapons were essential because the war with *ISIS*{:.small} was not over, a former Pentagon official told me The U.S. arms shipments to the Kurds continued.\n\nThe campaign against *ISIS*{:.small} was nearly derailed again when Turkish-backed fighters [invaded](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fnews\u002Fworld-middle-east-42704542) Afrin, one of three Kurdish cantons in northern Syria, in January, 2018. The offensive followed news that the U.S. planned to create a border force of several thousand—half from the S.D.F. and half new recruits—to better secure the Syrian borders with Turkey and Iraq. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters had passed through Turkish territory to join the caliphate. The U.S.-backed border force was designed to deal with a problem that Erdoğan had not addressed. Erdoğan countered that the U.S. was “creating a terror army” and vowed to “suffocate” it. \n\nThe Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F. troops away from the front line with *ISIS*{:.small}, to defend Afrin—this time without U.S. air power to support them. Washington disapproved of Ankara’s offensive, but Turkey was a *NATO*{:.small} ally. The S.D.F. was no match for Turkey’s tanks, artillery, and warplanes. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated. Relations soured with the United States; the offensive against *ISIS*{:.small} stalled. U.S. intelligence predicted that Mazloum might even end the partnership. “We’re on the two-yard line,” a senior U.S. Special Forces commander [told](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nbcnews.com\u002Fnews\u002Fworld\u002Fwhite-house-chaos-jeopardizes-war-isis-u-s-commanders-warn-n859966) NBC News. “We could literally fall into the end zone. We’re that close to total victory, to wiping out the *ISIS*{:.small} caliphate in Syria. We’re that close, and now it’s coming apart.”\n\nThe S.D.F. was also scrambling to administer and secure the region—roughly a third of Syria—that it had liberated. Towns were war-ravaged. Basic services were destroyed. Many residents had fled. In Arab areas, the S.D.F. turned to tribal sheikhs to help form new city councils. “The S.D.F. did not just clear territory. They held it,” McGurk, the former lead coördinator of the campaign, told me. “They recruited locals to govern and established a permissive security environment. That’s what allowed us to be in Syria with a very light U.S. footprint.”\n\nMazloum’s militia, which included a large female force, returned to the *ISIS*{:.small} battlefront last fall. The final hurdle was to clear Deir Ezzor province, which is home to Syria’s most valuable oil fields. In December, the S.D.F. captured Hajin and began mapping out the next two months of operations with U.S. Special Forces. Their focus was on eliminating the stubborn Islamic State pockets near the Iraqi border and stabilizing liberated areas to prevent an *ISIS*{:.small} resurgence. “We have obviously learned a lot of lessons in the past, so we know that once the physical space is defeated we can’t just pick up and leave,” McGurk [told](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.state.gov\u002Fr\u002Fpa\u002Fprs\u002Fdpb\u002F2018\u002F12\u002F288024.htm) reporters on December 11th. “We’re prepared to make sure that we do all we can to ensure this is enduring.” U.S. goals, he added, “will take some time.”\n\nSix days later, Mazloum was summoned by General Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. operations in the Middle East, for a video conference. The timing, at midnight in Syria, was unexpected. So was the message. “I was the first one to hear the words,” Salar Malla, Mazloum’s aide-de-camp and translator, told me. “Before you translate anything, you have to absorb it. I spoke the words, but I didn’t believe them.”\n\nGeneral Votel informed Mazloum that he had received a letter from the White House two hours earlier, ordering the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. Votel did not know the details, he told Mazloum, but he had wanted the Kurd to hear it from him rather than from the media. “It was a surprise,” Mazloum told me, at his forward operating base. “We didn’t believe that in the middle of the battle, when we’re fighting against *ISIS*{:.small}, when we’re fighting against all the others, that our partners would abandon us. To be honest, the painful point for us was that America is a great country. How could a great country behave like that and abandon its allies in the middle of the fight? And, from that time on, how are people going to trust in the Americans or partner with them in any fight in the future?”\n\nTrump had made the [decision](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fthe-shrinking-us-footprint-in-the-middle-east) unilaterally, U.S. officials told me. There had been no interagency review, no conferring with military brass, no discussions with the dozens of other countries in the U.S.-led coalition. Many were as surprised as Mazloum was. The pivot had been another telephone conversation with President Erdoğan. The Turkish leader asked why the U.S. needed two thousand troops in Syria if the caliphate was collapsing. Two days later, Trump [tweeted](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FrealDonaldTrump\u002Fstatus\u002F1075397797929775105), “We have defeated *ISIS*{:.small} in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” The problem was that *ISIS*{:.small} had not yet collapsed. It still had tens of thousands of fighters, families, and fans in pockets of the Euphrates River Valley.\n\nIn Washington, the backlash to Trump’s abrupt decision was immediate. Defense Secretary James Mattis pleaded with the President to change his mind; when he didn’t, [Mattis resigned](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fjames-mattis-is-out-what-comes-next). So did McGurk. Even Trump’s Republican allies expressed outrage. Lindsey Graham [called](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2018\u002F12\u002F19\u002Fpolitics\u002Flindsey-graham-trump-syria-withdrawal-stain-honor\u002Findex.html) the decision a “stain on the honor of the United States.” A bipartisan group of senators appealed to the White House. “If you decide to follow through with your decision to pull our troops out of Syria, any remnants of *ISIS*{:.small} in Syria will surely renew and embolden their efforts in the region,” they wrote. \n\nIn a rare public statement, Mazloum also appealed to Trump, asking him to keep at least half of the two thousand troops in place until all of the Islamic State’s territory was liberated. “We would like to have air cover, air support and a force on the ground to coordinate with us,” Kobani [told](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Farticle\u002Fus-mideast-crisis-syria-usa\u002Fu-s-backed-syrian-forces-call-for-1500-coalition-troops-to-stay-idUSKCN1Q71DU) reporters travelling with an American military delegation. “American forces must remain beside us.” Trump had once pledged to protect the S.D.F., Mazloum said. “I want him to live up to his word.” In a separate conversation, he admitted to me, “We’re worried about being alone again.” \n\nMazloum did not waver, however. “Immediately, we started thinking of the phase after the American presence in Syria, and how we’re going to distribute our forces and depend on our own capacity to preserve those gains,” he told me. “At the end of the day, this is an internal American decision, and we cannot intervene in it. So we started thinking about how we’re going to be able to fight and do policy without them.” \n\nA senior U.S. official who had worked closely with Mazloum reflected, “Never once did he not live up to exactly what he said he was going to do.” The S.D.F. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The final front line was Baghouz, the farming hamlet near the Iraqi border. It was a long slog, with repeated pauses to allow civilians, including the families of *ISIS*{:.small} fighters, to leave. “We don’t want the images from our last battle to be bloody,” Mazloum told me. “We’re not *ISIS*{:.small}.”\n\nWhen Baghouz finally fell, on March 23rd, Mazloum hosted a small liberation ceremony at his base. “It was a great day that we celebrated with all our friends and allies,” he messaged me on WhatsApp. “We are proud about what we did, that victory is not just for Kurds. It is for all humanity.” Mazloum invited his American counterparts to attend. In front of the stars and stripes, a band of young Syrians dressed in red-and-gold uniforms played the American national anthem.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8481ab3335f580f17b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8481ab3335f580f17b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"ISIS","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"isis"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"ISIS","parent":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"isis"},{"id":"5c2e1ca72396212cbb9fc9d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ca72396212cbb9fc9d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Islamic

Wearing fatigues, a beaded head scarf, and turquoise socks, Felat sat cross-legged on the floor, eating a homemade meal that her mother had sent in a plastic container from Qamishli, four hours away, in the northeast of the country. In the kitchen, two young female fighters washed dishes and glanced surreptitiously at Felat with bright-eyed adoration. At forty years old, she affects a passive, stoic expression that transforms startlingly into one of unguarded felicity when she is amused—something that, while we spoke, happened often. She had reason to be in good spirits. Her forces had recently completed an encirclement of Raqqa, and victory appeared to be imminent.\n\nThe Raqqa offensive, which concluded in mid-October, marks the culmination of a dramatic rise both for Felat and for the Kurdish political movement to which she belongs. For decades, the Syrian state—officially, the Syrian Arab Republic—was hostile to Kurds. Tens of thousands were stripped of citizenship or dispossessed of land; cultural and political gatherings were banned; schools were forbidden to teach the Kurdish language.\n\nQamishli, Felat’s home town, has long been a center of Kurdish political activity. In 2004, during a soccer match, Arab fans of a visiting team threw stones at Kurds, causing a stampede; a riot ensued, during which Kurds toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the father and predecessor of [Syria’s current President, Bashar.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2016\u002F04\u002F18\u002Fbashar-al-assads-war-crimes-exposed) Government security forces subsequently killed more than thirty Kurds. Amid the crackdown, a new Kurdish opposition group, the Democratic Union Party, organized and recruited clandestinely.\n\nIn 2011, when anti-government protests began spreading throughout Syria, Felat was studying Arabic literature at Hasakah University. The daughter of a poor farmer, she’d begun her studies late, “for economic reasons,” she told me. Along with several dozen other students, Felat left the university and returned to Qamishli. Within a week, Felat, who’d harbored ambitions of attending Syria’s national military academy and becoming an Army officer, had joined the Democratic Union Party’s militia, the Y.P.G. After a day of training, she was issued a Kalashnikov.\n\nFelat expected to fight the regime. But, as the anti-government demonstrations evolved into an armed rebellion and insurrections broke out in major cities, Assad withdrew nearly all the troops he had stationed in the predominantly Kurdish north. The Democratic Union Party allowed the regime to maintain control of an airport and of administrative offices in downtown Qamishli. Arab opposition groups decried the arrangement as part of a tacit alliance between Assad and the Kurds. Islamist rebels began launching attacks in northern Syria, and the Y.P.G. went to war against them. “Many Kurdish families brought their daughters to join,” Felat told me. “Many women signed up.” She described her female compatriots as “women who had joined to protect other women” from extremists and their sexist ideologies.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dc102ef73a95cdc875]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nBy mid-2014, *ISIS*{: .small} had become the largest Islamist rebel group in Syria. It seized Raqqa, a mostly Arab city that lies some forty miles south of the Kurdish region, and declared it the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate. *ISIS*{: .small} then pushed into Kurdish territory, and by October thousands of militants—armed with tanks, mortars, machine guns, and suicide vehicles—had reached Kobanî, a city on the Turkish border. Although the United States bombarded *ISIS*{: .small} from the air, the militants quickly captured several key neighborhoods, and raised their flag on a hill visible from Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s President, announced, “Kobanî is about to fall,” and *ISIS*{: .small} vowed that its members would celebrate the coming holy week of Eid al-Adha by praying in Kobanî’s mosques.\n\nThe Y.P.G. fought back, deploying small, lightly armed units throughout Kobanî’s streets. Felat was put in charge of eleven other women. Some, like her, were former students; some were professionals; some were wives and mothers. Apart from their rifles, they had one machine gun and one rocket-propelled-grenade launcher. “There were people who didn’t even have a Kalashnikov,” Felat told me. “They had to share.” When I asked her where she was when *ISIS*{: .small} declared that it would conquer the city before Eid al-Adha, she answered, “I was fighting on Mishtanour Hill.” The battle is famous among Syrian Kurds, partly for the heroic action of another female fighter, twenty-year-old Arin Mirkan. At the time, Felat and Mirkan were on the same side of the hill. *ISIS*{: .small} militants were closing in on them with tanks commandeered from Assad’s forces. Mirkan, Felat recalled, “put a lot of grenades on her chest and snuck under a tank and exploded herself.”\n\nMishtanour Hill fell to *ISIS*{: .small}, but Kobanî didn’t. The U.S. intensified its bombing, and air-dropped weapons and medical supplies; Iraqi Kurdish soldiers, along with some moderate Arab rebels, reinforced the Y.P.G. By late January, 2015, *ISIS*{: .small} had been pushed back. The Y.P.G. capitalized on its momentum and reclaimed swaths of the countryside.\n\nFelat was assigned to command forty-five fighters, and then three hundred. When I pressed her for the accomplishments that had occasioned her promotions, she reluctantly allowed, “I was good at strategy.” By chance, it was the week before Eid al-Adha, and I could not help marvelling at how swiftly the besieged had become besiegers. I asked Felat whether any of the women whom she’d fought with in Kobanî were still with her.\n\nShe shook her head. “Five were killed,” she said. “Two were wounded. The others went back to their families.” Felat did not mention having been injured herself, but I later met a fighter who recalled sharing a hospital room with her while they were both recovering from shrapnel wounds.\n\nThe Y.P.G. presents itself as the antithesis of *ISIS*{: .small}. Not only does it aggressively recruit women into its ranks; it promotes democracy and religious pluralism. Like many of her comrades, Felat has decided never to leave the Y.P.G., or marry, or have children. Her younger brother, Mezul, who joined the Y.P.G. after she did, was killed by a roadside bomb in 2013\\. Felat, who identifies as a nonpracticing Muslim, said that she has sworn on Mezul’s blood to devote her life to the Y.P.G. Although the battle for Raqqa is over, she, like most Syrians, foresees more fighting to come.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nTwo thousand *ISIS*{: .small} militants and hundreds of Kurds died in the battle of Kobanî. It took months to extricate the bodies from the wreckage. Locals say that the town’s feral cats, rummaging among the corpses, began to go bald; birds lost their feathers. Today, white placards stand amid rubble and outside damaged buildings, marking places where Kurdish fighters were killed, and listing their names in black and red paint. Many of the names belong to women. On a street downtown, two waist-high Plexiglas boxes are installed in the middle of a sidewalk that has been carefully rebuilt around them. Inside the boxes, debris and broken asphalt are preserved. At first, it’s hard to tell what else the boxes contain. Then you notice the remains of two female fighters who were killed there: tufts of dust-caked hair still rooted to gray, desiccated flaps of scalp.\n\nA few blocks away, at a local institution known as the Commission for the Martyrs, the high walls of an expansive gallery are covered with hundreds of framed portraits of slain Kobanî natives. When I visited recently, the pictures ended midway across one wall. Scaffolding had been erected, and dozens of new frames were stacked on the floor. A volunteer told me that the memorial was a work in progress; organized chronologically, it hadn’t yet caught up to 2017\\. At a far end of the gallery, faded portraits, from the nineties, showed local residents who had died in Turkey while fighting with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K. Pointing at one image—a pale girl with cropped hair and a determined stare—the volunteer said, “My sister. She left before I knew her.”\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dcd0c4bb5a016cdcfd]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThe Democratic Union Party and the Y.P.G. grew out of the P.K.K. Though it is a matter of dispute precisely how involved the P.K.K. remains in their activities, the organizations share the same objectives and beliefs. In the seventies, a Turkish university dropout, Abdullah Öcalan, founded the P.K.K. as a Marxist-Leninist movement committed to the creation of an independent Kurdish state. The group launched an insurgency that mainly targeted Turkish security personnel but also murdered Turkish civilians and Kurdish adversaries.\n\nIn 1997, the United States added the P.K.K. to its list of foreign terrorist organizations, and two years later the Central Intelligence Agency helped Turkish agents capture Öcalan. Placed in solitary confinement on a prison island off Istanbul, he did what many people would do: he read. He became fascinated by an obscure American political theorist—a Communist turned libertarian socialist named Murray Bookchin. The œuvre of Bookchin, who died in 2006, is vast and dense (a typical title is [“The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism”](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FPhilosophy-Social-Ecology-Dialectical-Naturalism\u002Fdp\u002F0921689683)). Öcalan was particularly influenced by Bookchin’s advocacy of “libertarian municipalism”: the proposition that citizens, instead of attempting to change, overthrow, or secede from oppressive capitalist governments, should build confederations of “popular assemblies” that can function as a parallel system within existing states. In 2004, one of Öcalan’s German translators wrote to Bookchin—then eighty-three and bedridden, with osteoarthritis, in Vermont—to inform him that Öcalan was determined to “implement your ideas.” Bookchin confessed to the translator that he wasn’t really familiar with Öcalan. “Thanks to our parochial press, Americans are barely informed about Kurdish affairs,” he wrote.\n\nÖcalan, who remains imprisoned, has published many pamphlets. In 2011, he released “[Democratic Confederalism](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FDemocratic-Confederalism-Abdullah-Ocalan\u002Fdp\u002F3942961172),” in which he repudiates the pursuit of an independent Kurdish state, on the ground that nation-states are inherently repressive, sexist, and complicit in the depravities of “the worldwide capitalist system.” He also discusses the peril of Middle Eastern nations’ being defined by religion or ethnicity. As an alternative, Öcalan suggests creating decentralized networks of community councils, where all “cultural identities can express themselves in local meetings.”\n\nThe P.K.K. had always included female guerrillas; the longer Öcalan remained in prison, however, the more preoccupied with feminism he became. In a 2013 manifesto, “[Liberating Life](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.co.uk\u002FLiberating-Life-Womans-Revolution\u002Fdp\u002F3941012827),” he writes that “the 5,000-year-old history of civilization is essentially the history of the enslavement of women,” and argues that no genuine political emancipation can happen without first achieving gender equality.\n\nThe P.K.K. adapted to Öcalan’s evolving ideas with surprising facility. But over the years many of its members, seeking refuge from the Turkish authorities, decamped to Iraq’s remote Qandil Mountains, where there was little society to revolutionize. Öcalan’s vision seemed destined to remain the utopian fancy of—as Bookchin called himself—“an old radical.” But then the Democratic Union Party came into possession of most of northern Syria.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAt a rally in Kobanî this summer, hundreds of residents congregated at a traffic circle, around a thirty-foot-tall statue of a Kurdish female fighter with enormous white wings. Made from iron and fibreglass, the statue towered over two tanks that *ISIS*{: .small} had used in its failed assault on the town. Now onlookers straddled the tanks’ cannons. A Y.P.G. soldier poured black oil from a plastic water bottle onto handmade torches, and distributed them to people. Traditional Kurdish songs blared through an industrial sound system installed in the bed of a pickup truck. Children and teen-agers danced.\n\nIt was August 14th, the eve of the thirty-third anniversary of the P.K.K.’s first attacks against the Turkish government. The conflict has left some forty thousand people dead, mainly Kurds. At some point, the music stopped, and a woman climbed into the truck, wielding a megaphone. “No life without our leader!” she shouted.\n\n“Long live Apo!” everyone cried, using a nickname for Öcalan.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F59f396dc73270d136eb40860]||||||\n+++\n\nIn Kurdish parts of Syria, Öcalan is hard to escape. His image appears on billboards, flags, walls, phones, pins, posters, and patches; usually he is depicted with a warm smile beneath a paintbrush mustache. He tends to look avuncular and professorial, and is rarely shown with a weapon. In January, 2014, the Democratic Union Party promulgated a charter based on Öcalan’s concept of democratic confederalism. Meant to lay the groundwork for “a society free from authoritarianism, militarism, centralism and the intervention of religious authority in public affairs,” the charter established three autonomous cantons in Rojava, as the Kurdish region in northern Syria is known. Each canton would be composed of councils overseen by a general assembly. The charter recognized the equal status of religions, languages, and minority groups—Arabs, Syriacs, Chechens, Armenians, and Yazidis. It also mandated that women comprise at least forty per cent of every governing body, institution, and committee. In an echo of Bookchin’s extensive writings on social ecology, protecting the environment was deemed a “sacred” duty.\n\nAfter the [Y.P.G.’s victory in Kobanî](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fvictory-kobani), it continued liberating towns from *ISIS*{: .small}, and increasingly collaborated with Arab fighters and Christian militias. The global anti-*ISIS*{: .small} coalition, led by the U.S., offered limited air support. The battlefield successes of the Y.P.G. contrasted starkly with the generally hapless efforts of American proxies elsewhere in Syria. By mid-2015, a five-hundred-million-dollar Pentagon program intended to train and equip more than five thousand anti-*ISIS*{: .small} fighters had produced only about a hundred of them; according to the Pentagon, most had been killed, abducted, or relieved of their weapons by Islamists. A C.I.A. initiative, which eventually cost more than a billion dollars, sponsored anti-government rebels. In 2015, when Russia intervened in Syria, on behalf of Assad, it effectively neutralized these units with air strikes.\n\nAlthough the Y.P.G. was prevailing militarily, the Obama Administration remained leery of it. Turkey, a *nato*{: .small} member that allows the U.S. to conduct air strikes over Syria from one of its military bases, [does not distinguish between the Y.P.G. and the P.K.K.,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fkobani-means-turkeys-kurds) which it considers an existential threat. At this year’s Aspen Security Forum, General Raymond Thomas, the head of the U.S. Special Operations Command, recounted telling Y.P.G. leaders, in late 2015, that if they wanted meaningful American support they had to change their “brand.” Thomas went on, “With about a day’s notice, they declared that they were the Syrian Democratic Forces. It was a stroke of brilliance to put ‘democracy’ in there.” Soon after the S.D.F. was conceived, a U.S. aircraft parachuted a hundred pallets of weaponry to its Arab contingents, and Obama dispatched Special Operations Forces to train and advise them.\n\nThe Trump Administration has doubled down on the strategy. In May, Trump approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds in the S.D.F. directly, and deployed several hundred marines and Army rangers to support them. Around this time, Turkish jets bombed sites in Rojava, reportedly killing twenty Y.P.G. members. The attack prompted U.S. troops, in marked vehicles, to join Kurdish fighters patrolling the Syrian-Turkish border. “This needs to stop,” Erdoğan declared, adding that the presence of American flags in a “terrorist” convoy had “seriously saddened us.”\n\nThe S.D.F., however, was the only rebel force capable of removing *ISIS*{: .small} from its capital. And though Raqqa does not have a large Kurdish population, Kurdish fighters were prepared to help capture it. Rojda Felat told me, “There were a lot of discussions. But all of them were about what our role would be, not whether we would play a role.”\n\nThe U.S. has not only ignored Turkey’s objections; it has bolstered the Kurds diplomatically. In Aspen, General Thomas explained, “They wanted a seat at the table, and because they had been branded as P.K.K. they could never get to the table.” According to Thomas, U.S. diplomats have pushed for the S.D.F.’s involvement in national peace talks that could determine the future of the country.\n\nAnd yet none of the Kurdish fighters I met described the Raqqa campaign as a political quid pro quo. For them, it was a necessary phase in an ambitious, lifelong revolution.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne afternoon this summer, near a front line in West Raqqa, I sat in a requisitioned residence with Ali Sher, a thirty-three-year-old Kurdish commander with a handlebar mustache and the traditional Y.P.G. uniform: camouflage Hammer pants and a colorful head scarf tied back pirate-style. Before the war, Sher sold clothes in a market in Kobanî. He joined the Y.P.G. when *ISIS*{: .small} attacked the city; after the battle, he made the same blood oath as Rojda Felat. “I have nothing else,” he told me. “I don’t have a wife. I don’t have children. I don’t even have a car.”\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396ddd0c4bb5a016cdcfe]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nWhen I asked Sher what he was doing in Raqqa, he said, “Don’t think we are fighting only for Rojava. We’re not soldiers—we’re revolutionaries.”\n\nTwo young women walked into the room, and Sher greeted them enthusiastically. One was a P.K.K. fighter from Turkey. (“Leave me alone,” she said when I tried to interview her.) The other had been Sher’s first commander in Kobanî. “During the training, he was very tired,” she said with a laugh. Her nom de guerre was Çîçek 23\\. In Kurdish, _çîçek_ means “flower.” Twenty-three comes from the name of a gun that she used on Mishtanour Hill. She told me that she, too, had devoted herself to the Y.P.G.\n\n“Think about this society,” Sher said. “If you’re married here, what can you give your children? Clothes? Food? Even slaves have clothes and food. When you are resisting oppression and injustice, you are fighting for more than just your own small family. You are fighting for your big family—society.”\n\nThe frontiers of the society for which Sher and Çîçek 23 are fighting have expanded considerably since they defended Kobanî. On March 17, 2016, the Democratic Union Party announced the creation of a “democratic federation” in Rojava, with the S.D.F. serving as its military. A draft constitution was soon put forward. It largely preserved the canton structure, and included a mechanism for incorporating other parts of Syria into its federal system.\n\nSher and Çîçek 23 shared the expectation that once *ISIS*{: .small} had been expelled from Raqqa the area’s citizens would vote to join the new federation. They hoped that Raqqa residents, having endured the Draconian rule of *ISIS*{: .small}, would be open to the diametrically contrary values championed by Öcalan, from secularism to gender equality. “When we liberate areas from *ISIS*{: .small}, we start a revolution in the mentality of the people,” Sher said. “This is the most important part.”\n\nThe assertion might have sounded quixotic, if not for some men who were sitting in the room with us. They were Yazidis from Shingal, a town in Iraqi Kurdistan. *ISIS*{: .small} harbors a special disdain for Yazidis, who are not Muslim, and after its militants in Iraq seized Mosul, in 2014, they attacked Shingal. Thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered; thousands of women and girls were abducted and forced into sexual slavery. Those who escaped made for a mountain range that looms over the town and extends into Rojava. P.K.K. and Y.P.G. fighters opened a corridor from the mountains into Syria. Sick and elderly Yazidis were evacuated. Able-bodied men and women were brought to training camps, formed into an armed militia, and sent back to fight *ISIS*{: .small}.\n\nA short and stocky twenty-seven-year-old Yazidi named Zardesht, who’d been trained and armed in Rojava, said of the Syrian and Turkish Kurds, “They saved us. They gave their blood to prevent our extermination.”\n\nZardesht and more than a thousand other Yazidis fought alongside the P.K.K. and the Y.P.G. on the outskirts of Shingal until November, 2015, when Iraqi Kurdish forces and a heavy U.S. bombing campaign helped them take back the town. Countless P.K.K. and Y.P.G. flags were raised across Shingal. “We started to trust in their ideology, because we thought that these beliefs would help us to protect our people,” Zardesht told me. “Now we are trying to apply the same council system in Shingal as the Kurds have in Rojava.” When the Raqqa offensive began, Zardesht and about forty other Yazidi militia members—half of them women—volunteered to take part.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dc4bf5dc2d3697c911]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n“We are ready to sacrifice our lives for the ideas of Abdullah Öcalan,” Zardesht said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAlthough most of the commanders in Raqqa were Kurds, most of the troops were Arabs. A few days after speaking with Ali Sher in West Raqqa, my translator and I followed two pickup trucks, crowded with about twenty Arab fighters, through the southern fringes of the city. (Arab units of the S.D.F. are entirely male.) As the trucks traversed a ravaged dirt road along the wide and calm Euphrates River, through overgrown orchards and sunflower gardens, the fighters cried out, “We are from Raqqa!” Turning north into ruined residential neighborhoods, we passed gutted husks of cars and buses, levelled buildings, and a depot littered with the twisted remnants of blown-up construction equipment.\n\nInside the city, the devastation was apocalyptic. Block after block of tall apartment towers had been obliterated. Every building seemed to have been struck by ordnance: either destroyed entirely, scorched black by fire, or in a state of mid-collapse, with slabs of concrete hanging precariously from exposed rebar and twisted I-beams. Bulldozers had plowed a path through heaps of cinder blocks, felled power poles, and other detritus. Up ahead, missiles hit: a whistle, then a crash, then a dark plume. Smoke and dust roiled over rooftops.\n\nA melee broke out as soon as we stopped. It was unclear who was in charge. Amid arguments about which teams should go where, some fighters were herded inside a building while others piled into a Humvee, which then sped off toward an abandoned children’s hospital that they were meant to capture. I joined a group of fighters gathered on the ground floor of the building. Most of them were from Tabqa, a city about twenty miles to the west. They had joined the S.D.F. when it liberated Tabqa, in May. After seventeen days of training from U.S. soldiers, they told me, they had been given Kalashnikovs and sent to the front. Some of them looked extremely young. One boy, Joresh Akool, must have been about fourteen. (He hesitated when I asked his age, then said that he was seventeen.) Smoking a cigarette and wearing a ski vest, despite it being well over a hundred degrees, Akool told me that he was the only member of his family left in Syria—everyone else had fled to Turkey. “My mother keeps telling me to come,” he said. “She says if I come she’ll find a wife for me.” The men around him laughed.\n\nSeveral of the Arab fighters wore patches featuring the face of Abdullah Öcalan. When I asked them what they thought about his ideas, however, they seemed indifferent. Many of them had battled the regime at the beginning of the war. Akool told me that one of his brothers had been killed in Aleppo while fighting Assad’s forces. “That was a long time ago,” he said. It wasn’t, really—about three years—but I knew what he meant. It was before *ISIS*{: .small} created its caliphate, before Russian and U.S. involvement, and before the S.D.F.\n\nDespite the Arab fighters’ lack of interest in the Kurdish social revolution, they said that they planned to remain in the S.D.F., even after the Raqqa offensive, as long as it continued to oppose *ISIS*{: .small}. “Wherever there is *ISIS*{: .small} in the world, I will fight them,” one of them said. “I’ll go to _America_ to fight them.” He wanted revenge for the indignities that *ISIS*{: .small} had made him suffer, and for his friends and relatives who had been killed. He said, “When *ISIS*{: .small} came to Tabqa, they arrested us and gave us Islamic instruction in the prison. They collected all the children and forced them to do military and Koranic training.”\n\nWe hadn’t been talking long when the Humvee returned with several men looking stunned and battered. Upon entering the children’s hospital, they’d triggered a mine. “We thought it was safe,” one of them said, explaining that a coalition jet had hit the hospital with an air strike, which should have detonated any improvised explosive devices that *ISIS*{: .small} had planted inside. A report came over someone’s radio: two men were dead, several wounded. The injuries included lost limbs.\n\nThe vast majority of S.D.F. fighters who were killed in Raqqa were Arabs, and most of them were killed by blasts. Firefights were rare. While I was there, at least, very few *ISIS*{: .small} militants seemed to be defending the city. The leadership was thought to have escaped south, to the province of Deir Ezzor. The problem now was the confounding proliferation of mines that *ISIS*{: .small} had left behind—and the S.D.F.’s inability to deal with them.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396e14bf5dc2d3697c913]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nIn [Mosul, where *ISIS*{: .small} had recently been defeated](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F02\u002F06\u002Fthe-desperate-battle-to-destroy-isis), the Iraqi Army had relied on an extensive fleet of American tanks and mine-resistant armored personnel carriers. But the U.S., in an effort to appease Turkey, has strictly limited its supply of matériel to the S.D.F. The five thousand troops fighting in Raqqa had access to only fifteen Humvees. Ali Sher’s men and another unit—two hundred and fifty fighters, in total—shared one of the Humvees, and shortly after I met them it was disabled for a few days by a grenade dropped by an *ISIS*{: .small} drone.\n\nAnother afternoon, on a street in East Raqqa, where the S.D.F. had pushed into the city’s old quarter, breaching a huge mud-mortar wall from the eighth century, I watched an armored bulldozer return from clearing some rubble nearby. Snipers had pierced the bulldozer in three places, and it leaked a black trail of oil in the dirt. The driver was a fifty-seven-year-old Arab from Hasakah—the city where Rojda Felat had attended college. Before joining the S.D.F., he’d worked on construction projects. Now his main responsibility was excavating mines with the bulldozer’s blade, often exploding them in the process. One blast had shattered a window in the cab.\n\nFront-line units carried sacks full of jury-rigged bombs: softball-size amalgams of homemade explosives, packaged in plastic wrap and spiked with six-inch fuses. At least one bomb was thrown into every building that the fighters planned to enter, in order to set off any mines inside. This precautionary measure, however, insured the destruction of whatever structures had managed to evade aerial bombardment—and it wasn’t even foolproof. Before the Arab fighters from Tabqa had entered the children’s hospital, they had deployed ten such bombs.\n\nFour days after the incident at the hospital, I visited the surrounding area. The Humvee I was in stopped next to a Toyota pickup truck with Iraqi plates and a Russian machine gun mounted in the bed; it had been compressed beneath a building pancaked by an air strike. Next door, in a second-floor bedroom of a once luxurious home, I met three mine-removal technicians—the first I’d seen in Raqqa.\n\nThey were preparing to sweep the hospital for a third time. “The first time we went in, we found about twenty mines,” one of them, a bearded Arab in gold-rimmed sunglasses, told me. They had no formal training: their primary qualification for the job appeared to be their willingness to do it. The man with the sunglasses was coiling rope tied to a grappling hook. Whenever they found an I.E.D., he explained, he placed or tossed the hook near its triggering device, paid out the rope, and pulled. Their other tool was a plastic mirror that had been Scotch-taped to a paint roller. A second technician proudly showed me how a pole attached to the roller’s handle extended and collapsed, enabling them to see around corners. *ISIS*{: .small} had dug a tunnel into the hospital’s basement. “That last air strike was trying to damage it,” he said. “We heard on the radio that *ISIS*{: .small} wants to capture some of us alive.”\n\nIn another bedroom of the house, I found the ranking commander for the area, a Kurd, sitting on a box spring beneath a shattered window that overlooked the hospital. Twenty-one years old, diminutive, and clean-shaven, with a line of pale scalp on the side of his head where a bullet had grazed him, he introduced himself as Vietnam Kobanî. His real name was Khairee Halal. Before the war, Halal had been a barber in Aleppo. When Y.P.G. fighters arrived in the city and set up a militia in the Kurdish quarter, he joined them. As Aleppo became divided between regime forces and rebel groups, the Kurds were caught between the two sides. “We were not with either,” Halal told me. “We were just defending our neighborhood.” [I spent a month in Aleppo in 2013](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2013\u002F04\u002F29\u002Fthe-river-martyrs), and many Arab rebels I met there believed that the Kurds were not as neutral as they claimed: Assad’s intelligence agents were said to enjoy free rein in the Kurdish quarter. That April, however, the Y.P.G. in Aleppo formally allied itself with the opposition.\n\nIn 2015, Halal left Aleppo and joined the campaign against *ISIS*{: .small} in northern Syria after his father, who was also in the Y.P.G., was killed near Kobanî. According to Halal, an Arab member of his father’s unit betrayed his comrades, removing the firing pin on their sole machine gun while they slept. The next day, *ISIS*{: .small} militants ambushed the position, killing all thirteen Kurdish fighters stationed there. “This man had been in my father’s unit for two years,” Halal said. “They trusted him. He’d said he wanted to help the Kurds.”\n\nWhether or not the story was true, Halal believed it. I asked him how he felt about commanding Arabs now. He nodded toward the broken window, beyond which explosions and sniper fire had been sounding. He said simply, “A lot of them are brave and fighting in a strong way.” Then, seeming to recognize the irony of his situation—or, in any case, seeming to recognize that I found it ironic—Halal added, “We think that man did what he did for money. *ISIS*{: .small}_paid_ him to do it.” As Joresh Akool had told me, 2014 was a long time ago.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dd6278396057c91b65]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nIn Aleppo, certainly, a lot had changed. After regime soldiers killed Akool’s brother, moderate Arabs in the opposition were gradually vanquished by Islamists, and so the Y.P.G. switched sides. Last December, Kurds helped Assad’s forces retake the city.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe deep grievances that many Arabs harbor toward *ISIS*{: .small} have brought about their unlikely collaboration with the disciples of Abdullah Öcalan. But it is not clear if this temporary military alliance will translate into an enduring political one after *ISIS*{: .small} has been purged from Syria. In Raqqa, the Kurds seem determined to try to strengthen the bond. This April, a delegation of a hundred and ten displaced natives of the city—technocrats, teachers, attorneys, and other professionals—established the Raqqa Civil Council, a governing body modelled on the regional assemblies of the new democratic federation in northern Syria. Once Raqqa was secure, the delegation declared, the council, which has U.S. backing, would assume administration of the city.\n\nWhen I visited its interim offices, in a town forty miles north of Raqqa, dozens of people had crowded outside the door of a senior councilman, Omar Alloush. Inside, Alloush, a rotund, gray-haired, chain-smoking Kurdish lawyer from Kobanî, was talking with two men: an S.D.F. official, in a suit, and an Arab sheikh, in a kaffiyeh and traditional white robes. The sheikh, Farris Horan, served on a committee for the Raqqa Civil Council that acted as a liaison to Raqqa’s Arab tribes. An S.D.F. fighter had accidentally shot an Arab civilian, and, after meeting with the leaders of the victim’s tribe, Horan was negotiating financial compensation. Once the two men had settled the issue and left the room, Alloush, speaking of the Arab tribes, told me, “They don’t necessarily believe in our ideology. But they see a future with us. That’s why they joined us.”\n\nBy “us,” he did not mean only the Raqqa Civil Council. Alloush had helped found a political arm of the S.D.F. that is responsible for managing the envisaged expansion of the democratic federation beyond Rojava. “We believe in a new constitution for Syria,” Alloush told me. Every community that the S.D.F. liberated from *ISIS*{: .small} would be urged to join the federation. “Maybe some places will be autonomous,” he said. “Federal system, noncentral system—this decision will come from the people. We have to wait and see how they’ll vote.”\n\nA few days later, my translator and I gave Horan a ride to a village about ten miles east of Raqqa, across a black expanse of volcanic sand flats. The village, which hugged the banks of the Euphrates, was in an area called Karama, and Horan had been invited to attend a ceremony in which Karama’s largest Arab tribe would announce its endorsement of the Raqqa Civil Council. In the car, Horan said, “They were the main tribe supporting *ISIS*{: .small} around here. Even now, a lot of them are still with *ISIS*{: .small}. But others are with us. So it’s complicated.”\n\nIn March, when the S.D.F. took Karama, hundreds of villagers retreated to Raqqa with *ISIS*{: .small}. Some were forced to go; some had been recruited as militants and went willingly. Among those who stayed in Karama, twelve hundred men had joined the S.D.F. They were now fighting their former neighbors and relatives on the front lines in Raqqa. Indeed, Horan said, the brother of the sheikh hosting the day’s ceremony had joined *ISIS*{: .small}, and was a high-ranking official within the caliphate.\n\nIn the village center, five long tents stood in a field beside a concrete water tower lying on its side. (*ISIS*{: .small} had sabotaged it.) Under the tents, hundreds of Arab men, representing forty-odd tribes from Raqqa Province, sat on carpets, watching several sheikhs mingle with one another, as well as with Kurdish members of the S.D.F., many of whom were women. When one of the two co-chairs of the Raqqa Civil Council entered the tent—Laila Mustafa, a twenty-nine-year-old Kurdish engineer, wearing black jeans and boots, her hair in a ponytail—the sheikhs stood to shake her hand.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dd29b5a726248c552a]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nOmar Alloush, the Kurdish senior councilman, presided over the ceremony. He stood before the tribesmen and passionately condemned *ISIS*{: .small}, the Assad regime, and anti-government rebels not belonging to the S.D.F. Only the S.D.F., he said, “aims to end the Syrian crisis and build a new democratic Syria.” Other Kurdish leaders followed with similar speeches, vowing to spread their revolution to the entire country.\n\nThe head of the main tribe in Karama, who was known as Abu Jihad, stepped forward. An older man with a pockmarked face, he was, compared with the Kurdish speakers, conspicuously tepid. He thanked people for coming and mumbled, “We are ready to be with you.”\n\nAlloush stood up again. “Out of respect for everyone who is here today,” he said, the S.D.F. would release fifty local families who, suspected of having especially close ties to *ISIS*{: .small}, had been held in a nearby camp for internally displaced people. The news was greeted with loud applause.\n\nAfter an elaborate lunch was served, I spoke privately with Abu Jihad. He told me that before *ISIS*{: .small} arrived “there were no radical beliefs” in Karama. “No one thought like that, not even the people who ended up joining *ISIS*{: .small}.” This included his younger brother, Tobat. Abu Jihad said that Tobat had opposed the Assad regime, but was not particularly religious. When *ISIS*{: .small} came to Karama, in 2014, Abu Jihad urged Tobat to stay away. “I told him, ‘There’s no future with them.’ We argued a lot.” Abu Jihad claimed that many people in Karama fell under the sway of *ISIS*{: .small} simply because “there were no schools—there was only the Sharia instruction.” He added, “*ISIS*{: .small} filled all the young people’s minds with their ideas. My brother was one of them.” Tobat retreated with the *ISIS*{: .small} militants to Raqqa, and one day he sent envoys home to recruit fighters. “I called him and told him, strongly, not to do that again,” Abu Jihad recalled. “I said, ‘You made your decision. Now you have to fight alone.’ That was the last time we spoke.” Still, Abu Jihad insisted that Tobat was “a good person.” In Raqqa, he said, Tobat had “helped many people” by standing up for them against less fair-minded *ISIS*{: .small} officials. Abu Jihad said that most of the local men who’d joined *ISIS*{: .small} were redeemable. “A lot of them want to come back,” he told me. “But *ISIS*{: .small} won’t let them.”\n\nI asked him if these men would be welcomed by his tribe if they somehow escaped.\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nAnd Tobat? Did he want to come back?\n\n“I don’t know,” Abu Jihad said. He studied the prayer beads in his hands, then told me, “I’m sure he will leave them and return to us.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe Raqqa Civil Council’s forgiving attitude toward former *ISIS*{: .small} sympathizers, and its deference to Arab tribal structures, contrasted strikingly with what I saw in Rojava. In the majority-Kurdish cantons, winning Arab support is not essential, and indoctrination seems to be more the goal. All men in Rojava between the ages of eighteen and thirty, regardless of their ethnicity, must serve at least ten months in a kind of national guard. In a camp outside Kobanî, I attended a graduation ceremony for some five hundred conscripts, who’d just completed basic training. Most of them were Arabs. When I asked one of the instructors—nearly all of whom were Kurds—what the training entailed, he said, “We really focus on the mentality, the _beliefs_, more than the military stuff. Our main objective is to send a new man back to society, and in this way to build a new society.”\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dd47bc2e22a0397b8c]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThe instructor’s classes were intellectually ambitious. “I explain the federalist project,” he said. “I begin with the whole history of federalism, from before the term existed, when it started in Greece. We talk about the Romans, about Columbus discovering America, and about the first American Congress and the colonies. Then I explain the system here in Rojava, which is not a nation-state but a mixing of different communities.” The class lasts six hours a day for twenty days. Arab conscripts take workshops in the Kurdish language twice a week.\n\nThe instructor didn’t mention Öcalan to me, but when the graduation ceremony began and conscripts marched across a dirt parade ground to the bleating of a brass band, they chanted, “No life without Apo!”\n\n“Who’s our leader?” a Kurdish female instructor shouted.\n\n“Apo!”\n\nLater, in a speech, the female instructor invoked the anniversary of the P.K.K.’s first attacks on the Turkish government: “This month was a holy month, because we are continuing the path that was started by Öcalan.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, a Kurdish poet recited some of his revolutionary verse, and musicians performed traditional Kurdish songs. While talking with a Kurdish instructor, I remarked on the dozens of abandoned mud-mortar dwellings scattered throughout the camp, which appeared to have once been a village.\n\n“Arabs used to live here,” he said.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F59f396dc29b5a726248c5529]||||||\n+++\n\n“What happened to them?” I asked.\n\n“They left with *ISIS*{: .small}.”\n\n“Where are they now?”\n\n“Nobody knows.”\n\nIn late 2015, after a two-month investigation, Amnesty International accused the Y.P.G. of forcibly displacing Arabs in northern Syria, and of razing Arab villages there. According to Amnesty, the attacks constituted a “campaign of collective punishment of civilians in villages previously captured” by *ISIS*{: .small}, or in places “where a small minority were suspected of supporting the group.” A subsequent U.N. commission, which investigated more recent allegations, found “no evidence to substantiate claims that Y.P.G. or S.D.F. forces ever targeted Arab communities on the basis of ethnicity.”\n\nAt the camp, Kurdish instructors never left my side, and I had difficulty meeting Arab conscripts. Finally, I sat down with a young man named Malik Mohammad, and asked him what he thought of his training.\n\n“It’s useful,” Mohammad said.\n\nThe reply felt unconvincing. Like most Arab conscripts, he would probably spend the next ten months performing menial duties, away from his family. Although sixty new graduates had been selected to become officers, all but two were Kurds.\n\nWhen I asked Mohammad to elaborate, he glanced timidly at several Kurdish conscripts hovering around us. Then he said, “They teach us about the importance of a free society. But if we were free we’d be able to _choose_ whether or not to serve” in the national guard.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dd48f1ac186c9ead45]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nMany Kurds also dislike the conscription policy. But the Democratic Union Party, despite its lofty charter and constitution, has shown little patience for dissent. While the Party was consolidating power in northern Syria, rival figures in the Kurdish opposition were arbitrarily imprisoned; others were killed, or went missing. In 2013, Y.P.G. fighters shot and killed three Kurds protesting the detention of anti-Assad activists. The leader of an alliance of Kurdish political parties that are wary of the P.K.K. has been forced into exile. In March, more than a dozen offices belonging to groups opposed to the Democratic Union Party were forcibly shut down.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe Syrian civil war has produced many strange bedfellows. But it’s especially curious that Öcalan’s revolution, which strives to eliminate “capitalist modernity,” has made its recent advancements under the patronage of the United States. In Rojava, Kurds often refer to Donald Trump as _Bâvê şoreş_—“Father of the Revolution”—and in Kobanî there is a kebab restaurant called Trump, with the President’s visage painted on its window. I met a Y.P.G. fighter who’d named his infant daughter America.\n\nDuring the Raqqa offensive, U.S. Special Operations Forces were deployed throughout the city, but they avoided journalists. The S.D.F. also severely restricted the press. Reporters were assigned minders, and access to active front lines was almost impossible to obtain. More than once, I was told that I couldn’t go somewhere, only to find out later that U.S. soldiers had been in the area, or that bombardment from coalition planes and artillery had taken place nearby. U.S. Special Operations Forces ran a field hospital in Raqqa that treated wounded S.D.F. fighters; when I went there and asked if anyone would speak with me, I was aggressively confronted by half a dozen armed Americans, one of whom said, “Absolutely not.” He confiscated my phone and demanded its password. (I didn’t give it to him, and he eventually returned the phone.) An older American, with a graying beard and a ball cap, told me, “For you, information is a good thing.” He then explained that, for security reasons, it was better if nobody knew that they were there. Several soldiers escorted me to my car, and for the next two days the S.D.F. shut down the entire area to reporters.\n\nNo doubt the security concerns were legitimate. But the efforts to limit media coverage in Raqqa, by both the Americans and the Kurds, might also have been tied to the controversial way that the campaign was conducted. According to the watchdog group Airwars, the coalition deployed some twenty thousand munitions during the Raqqa offensive and killed more than thirteen hundred civilians, including at least two hundred and fifty children. Thousands were injured. In August, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, declared that civilians were “paying an unacceptable price.” The coalition went on to escalate its bombing.\n\nMany of the coalition’s strikes on Raqqa originated with front-line revolutionary Kurdish commanders like Ali Sher. At all times, Sher carried an iPad on which was installed a satellite map of Raqqa. The map allowed him to pinpoint the G.P.S. coördinates of any structure by touching its image on the screen. He could radio the coördinates to a tactical-operations center and request that the structure be targeted by coalition missiles, mortars, rockets, or artillery. Usually, Sher told me, his requests were approved. The numerous air strikes I witnessed each day in Raqqa seemed incongruous, given the apparent paucity of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters there. One day, Sher’s unit moved its line forward by five blocks, capturing forty buildings in the process. While they were completing the operation, I talked to Sher, who told me that nobody had shot at them the whole time. According to the latest intelligence, he said, between five and six hundred *ISIS*{: .small} fighters remained in Raqqa. I asked him what all the bombing was for.\n\n“Snipers,” he said. “And mines. Sometimes it’s just one guy.”\n\nThe U.S. has largely disparaged criticism of its strikes. The coalition’s commander, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently wrote that assertions by groups like Airwars “are often unsupported by fact.” Omar Alloush, of the Raqqa Civil Council, was similarly dismissive about civilian casualties. He told me, “There are only two kinds of people left in Raqqa—*ISIS*{: .small} and thieves. Otherwise, why haven’t they left yet?”\n\nAt the time of this conversation, an estimated twenty thousand civilians were still trapped in Raqqa; attempting to escape was extremely dangerous. *ISIS*{: .small} snipers often shot at fleeing civilians, and many others were killed or maimed by mines. S.D.F. commanders told me that *ISIS*{: .small} used civilians as shields, putting them on the rooftops of buildings they occupied. Two primitive aid stations treated wounded civilians in Raqqa. At both of them, I was told that the vast majority of patients had stepped on mines while trying to reach the S.D.F.’s front line. (When I asked the American with the graying beard if the field hospital treated civilians, he replied, “That’s not our mission.”)\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59f396dd109d3025526d4d9d]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nAfter coalition air strikes took out two bridges over the Euphrates, in February, the main option for fleeing civilians was to hire a smuggler with a boat. The next month, the coalition dropped leaflets over Raqqa with a warning: “Do not use ferries or boats. Air strikes are coming.” Lieutenant General Townsend [told the _Times_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F02\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fus-backed-forces-close-to-trapping-isis-holdouts-in-raqqa.html?_r=0), “We shoot every boat we find,” adding, “If you want to get out of Raqqa right now, you’ve got to build a poncho raft.”\n\nOne would think that the killing of civilians, along with the total demolition of Raqqa’s infrastructure, might risk alienating residents, or turn them against their would-be liberators. For some, surely, this is the case. But others whom I spoke with exhibited a remarkable—and heartbreaking—forbearance from judgment. In South Raqqa, I met Ahmed Almoo, an S.D.F. fighter who had crossed the Euphrates, in a boat, two months earlier. Almoo was fifty-six but looked decades older. I’d noticed him standing guard outside an Arab unit’s position one morning, and was struck by the sight of a man so wizened and fragile wearing a uniform and holding a Kalashnikov. He told me that he’d been a butcher in Raqqa. To pay his smuggler, he’d sold all the equipment from his shop and the furniture from his home. His brother, who couldn’t afford to join him, had been killed by an air strike. All the same, Almoo had not hesitated to join the S.D.F. “I suffered a lot from *ISIS*{: .small},” he explained. He blamed the group for the death of his son. “He started feeling sick, and we took him to a doctor who did some tests and told us he had stomach cancer. But there’s no medicine or anything in Raqqa, and *ISIS*{: .small} won’t let people leave to find a hospital. So I just brought him home, and he died.”\n\nThis echoed previous conversations I’d had. The day I went to Karama, Farris Horan, the tribal liaison, had pointed out a village on the way. His cousin had lived there with her husband, a sheikh. After they had a son, she invited friends over to celebrate. Horan said that the coalition must have mistaken the party for an *ISIS*{: .small} gathering. An air strike hit the house, killing eleven people, including Horan’s cousin and her baby. In the car, Horan brought out his phone and showed me a photograph of the boy, purple-faced and swaddled in white blankets. The sheikh survived. I asked Horan what the sheikh was doing now. “He has a unit in the S.D.F.,” Horan said. “He coördinates directly with the coalition.”\n\nI expressed incredulity.\n\n“All people here want right now is to be finished with *ISIS*{: .small},” Horan told me. “They will accept almost anything if they can just get rid of *ISIS*{: .small}.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe willingness to countenance American crimes because of more egregious ones committed by *ISIS*{: .small}, Russia, and the regime, speaks to how tragically tolerant some Syrians have grown of what might once have appalled them. It might also reveal a fear that U.S. involvement in Syria will be short-lived. One day, in a waiting room in Kobanî, a stranger handed me his phone to show me some Kurdish text that he’d typed into Google Translate: “We love Americans so much I hope you do not give up on us.” The sentiment was repeated by many others I met in northern Syria, especially by Kurdish members of the S.D.F.\n\nTheir worry is understandable. America’s partnership with the S.D.F. still infuriates Turkey. In July, Turkey’s state news agency published a map identifying ten undisclosed U.S. bases in Rojava, and the Turkish military began shelling a Kurdish district there. Turkish officials announced, “We will never allow the establishment of a terror state along our borders.”\n\nMany Kurdish fighters I met in Raqqa said that they were ready to fight the Turkish Army next. At the graduation ceremony in Kobanî, the conscripts were commanded to stand against “our enemies in Turkey.” From the perspective of U.S. interests, however, once *ISIS*{: .small} has been defeated in Syria the utility of Kurdish fighters will diminish significantly. If a direct conflict broke out between Turkey and the S.D.F., it is difficult to imagine the U.S. employing force against its *NATO*{: .small} ally. It is equally difficult to imagine the S.D.F. withstanding a Turkish incursion, unless it were supported by U.S. airpower.\n\nIn mid-October, *ISIS*{: .small} holdouts in Raqqa were granted safe passage out of the city. According to Omar Alloush, the Kurdish senior member of the Raqqa Civil Council, two hundred and seventy-five Syrian *ISIS*{: .small} members “turned themselves in to their tribes, in exchange for forgiveness.” (Although some of those who surrendered came from Karama, the home of Abu Jihad, his brother Tobat was not among them.)\n\nThis fall, S.D.F. fighters and regime forces have been racing for control of *ISIS*{: .small}’s last bastion, the province of Deir Ezzor. The S.D.F. recently captured a large oil field there. The Assad regime, backed by Russian air power, is fighting in the provincial capital. A direct phone line connects the command centers of the U.S. and Russian militaries in Syria, so that they can avoid inadvertent clashes. Nonetheless, the coalition says, Russian planes have targeted S.D.F. positions, wounding fighters.\n\nEven as the Democratic Union Party has embraced the U.S.-led coalition and forged alliances with anti-government rebels, it has tried to reach an accommodation with Assad. Crude from northern Syria’s abundant oil fields, which the Democratic Union Party largely controls, is exported in tanker convoys to Damascus, and an overland route links Rojava to regime-controlled Aleppo. The Kurdish quarter in Aleppo has been granted semi-autonomy, and regime soldiers still guard the administrative buildings that the government was allowed to keep after withdrawing troops from Rojava.\n\nOutside Rojava, Bashar al-Assad’s military position is as strong as it has been in years. He has described the autonomous Kurdish cantonments as “temporary structures,” and he has never equivocated about his intention to bring the entire country back under his control. Robert S. Ford, the former U.S. Ambassador to Syria, [recently wrote in _Foreign Affairs_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.foreignaffairs.com\u002Farticles\u002Fsyria\u002F2017-10-16\u002Fkeeping-out-syria) that Assad “will probably succeed.” Ford continued, “That means the United States will have to abandon any hopes of supporting a separate Kurdish region or securing respect for human rights and democracy.” In his view, “when the Syrian government and Kurdish forces inevitably fight,” it would be “a mistake” for the U.S. to “step in on behalf of old allies.”\n\nOn October 19th, in a ceremony at Naim Square, in the center of Raqqa, the S.D.F. announced that the city had been “liberated.” This feels like a misnomer. The coalition’s air campaign has left Raqqa an uninhabitable wasteland. More than three hundred thousand civilians have been displaced. In September, Omar Alloush told me that he’d met with U.S. State Department officials who’d pledged American financial help for the rebuilding of Raqqa’s infrastructure, power plants, schools, and water and sanitation systems. “Until now, this is only words,” he said. “They have given nothing.”\n\nAll the same, the event at Naim Square was celebratory. Under *ISIS*{: .small}, the square had been the site of beheadings and crucifixions. Now a huge banner showing a smiling Öcalan was unfurled. Y.P.G. flags flew. “My heart was jumping for joy,” Rojda Felat said recently. “We thought it would be much more difficult.” She noted, “One time, on the front lines, the enemy attacked and the men took a step back—but the women didn’t. When the men saw them, they started fighting again.”\n\nHundreds of female Kurdish fighters, from various units around the city, congregated in the square. Nesrin Abdullah, the commander of an all-female branch of the Y.P.G., gave a speech commemorating the thirty female fighters who had been killed during the offensive. “Women have freed themselves of the exploitative male regime in political, social, cultural, and military aspects,” Abdullah declared. “We dedicate the liberation of Raqqa to all the women of the world.”\n\nWhatever the Kurdish revolution is or isn’t, and however sincerely its adherents have sought to implement their ideals, its commitment to women’s rights cannot be dismissed. For many women in the Y.P.G., the revolution is, above all, an unprecedented feminist endeavor for the Middle East. One day in Raqqa, in September, I met a twenty-two-year-old fighter named Shilan, who was wearing fatigues, Chuck Taylors, and a calculator watch. She told me, “The men we are fighting against treat women like animals. They make them slaves, they rape them. As a woman, I have to fight these men.”\n\n*ISIS*{: .small} is spectacularly misogynist, but Kurdish society can also be sexist, Shilan pointed out. She said that joining the Y.P.G. and battling *ISIS*{: .small} was, in part, a means of transcending limitations that would otherwise define her life at home: “Your family tells you that you can’t wear certain clothes. When you go out, people say you have to stay with your husband. You’re not free. Nobody listens to you. Here, you have the right to your opinion. Men care what you have to say. They want to put you in the front. It’s possible to have your place.”\n\nI asked her whether she could imagine being a civilian again, when the war in Syria ends. From where we stood, it felt like a frivolously hypothetical question, but Shilan answered right away.\n\nNo, she’d never go back. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7981ab3335f580f166","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Syria","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"syria"},{"id":"5c2e1f3541e4c73c088d79e6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rojda Felat","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rojda-felat"},{"id":"5c2e1c99ee7fe02cbd163366","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kurds","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kurds"},{"id":"5c2e1c7eee7fe02cbd163338","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"ISIS (Islamic State)","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"isis-islamic-state"},{"id":"5c2e1f36e56e652c90274908","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Civil Wars","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"civil-wars"},{"id":"5c2e1cafee7fe02cbd16337c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fighters","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fighters"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b4a08312cd3aa6c55","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Women","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"women"}],"sections":[{"id":"591bb882ccc2bd451f5eb3c6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Syria","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-syria"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8af4e65be2f29d55ebb","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fcontributors\u002Fluke-mogelson","email":"","name":"Luke Mogelson","socialMedia":[],"title":"Luke Mogelson has been contributing to The New Yorker since 2013.

It was little noticed at the time. The readout from the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, on December 14th, was typical blah-blah diplomat-speak: the two Presidents had discussed “bilateral issues,” including “security concerns” in Syria and “the fight against terrorism.” News was so sparse that the on-duty pool reporter, Hunter Walker, of Yahoo, supplemented his e-mail to White House colleagues with a note that, “There is a lot of dessert left over in the White House basement.” The White House provided nary a hint that a monumental change in U.S. foreign policy was afoot—partly because so few knew.\n\n \n\nFive days later, after Trump tweeted his abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, top officials in his own Administration—and dozens of countries in the U.S.-led coalition against *ISIS*{: .small}—scrambled to piece together what had happened. There had been no interagency review, an often-prolonged process that methodically develops options from which the President picks. There had been no major deliberations with allies. Trump had long vowed to bring American forces home, but, just days earlier, the Pentagon and the State Department had publicly pronounced that the mission in Syria was far from accomplished. The call with Erdoğan, which lasted about a half hour, turned out to be the pivot, according to a well-placed U.S. official. \n\n \n\nThe conversation, through interpreters, was organized so that Trump could reinforce a warning that Turkey should not move militarily into the northeast quadrant of Syria, where U.S.-backed forces were still clearing out thousands of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters. Erdoğan has been threatening strikes on a Kurdish militia that is the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is [armed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F31\u002Fworld\u002Fmiddleeast\u002Fus-begins-arming-syrian-kurds-for-final-assault-on-raqqa.html), aided, and advised by U.S. troops. Two days earlier, the Pentagon had [declared](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Farticle\u002Fus-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-pentagon\u002Funilateral-military-action-into-northeast-syria-unacceptable-pentagon-idUSKBN1OB2WC) that any military action near U.S. personnel, whatever the intent, was “unacceptable.”\n\n \n\nErdoğan turned the tables on Trump. He asked why Washington still had two thousand troops in Syria when the Islamic State’s caliphate had collapsed. It’s our neighborhood, he told Trump. Turkey could eradicate the remnants of *ISIS*{: .small} and help stabilize Syria. There’s no longer reason for the U.S. to be there, he said, but pledged to coördinate with the United States. Erdoğan laid it out in a way that made sense to the President, the source told me.\n\n \n\nThe White House tried to downplay the call. “The President merely informed his Turkish counterpart about his decision,” a senior Administration official told reporters on Wednesday. “It was not something he discussed with President Erdoğan.” But, on Friday, Erdoğan said publicly that Trump had decided to withdraw after Turkey promised to finish the job in Syria. “We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate *ISIS*{: .small} elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,” the Turkish leader said, in a speech in Istanbul. If the Erdoğan call had not happened on Friday, the U.S. official told me, the announcement to withdraw would not have been made on Wednesday.\n\n \n\nPerhaps coincidentally, or perhaps not, on Tuesday, the State Department [approved](https:\u002F\u002Fapnews.com\u002F583a18db0cd340a1a553c64ff9a47ef9) the sale of Patriot missile systems—worth three and a half billion dollars—to Turkey. Frustrated at the slow progress on its long-standing request for Patriots, Erdoğan’s government had turned to Russia to buy its S-400 missiles. The United States and Turkey’s other partners in *NATO*{: .small} had opposed the Russia arms deal. Now the U.S. transaction is back on track.\n\n \n\nThe Erdoğan call may not have gone as the President originally intended, but it precipitated an action that he has long wanted to take: to get out of foreign military hot spots. As he marks two years in office, Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. On Thursday, Trump ordered half of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan to start pulling out—the second order to withdraw from a long-standing commitment in two days—which also stunned top U.S. officials. At seventeen years, Afghanistan is America’s longest war.\n\n \n\nAs with Syria, the decision was made before the full defeat of a jihadi-extremist enemy. It also undermined U.S. leverage in negotiating a political deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban to insure that the thousands of American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars expended after 9\u002F11 were not wasted. In both Syria and Afghanistan, Trump undercut both his own special envoys—[Jim Jeffrey](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtoninstitute.org\u002Fpress-room\u002Fview\u002Fjeffrey-appointed-pompeos-syria-advisor) for Syria (who was only appointed in August) and [Zalmay Khalilzad](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2018\u002F09\u002F05\u002F641094135\u002Fzalmay-khalilzad-appointed-as-u-s-special-adviser-to-afghanistan) in Afghanistan (who was named in September)—just as they were building diplomatic momentum.\n\n \n\nTrump’s twin withdrawals have sweeping implications—beginning with the equally abrupt announcement that Defense Secretary James Mattis, the most respected member of the President’s Cabinet, was resigning in protest. “They emphasize that this Administration is hardly one that a country can make a deal with, that it has no unity of purpose, and that you don’t know who you’re talking to,” Paul Salem, the president of the Middle East Institute, told me. Across the Middle East and neighboring South Asia, governments are now worried about a resurgence of Sunni extremists in *ISIS*{: .small}, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Hezbollah, a militant Shiite movement, has effectively now become a regional power by helping President Bashar al-Assad win in Syria. Even a minimal U.S. military presence offered psychological and political leverage in the great and small power rivalries that riddle the Middle East.\n\n \n\nTrump’s broader agenda in the region is undermined, former senior diplomats said. “Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria has dealt a strategic blow to Israel’s national security,” Martin Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, [tweeted](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FMartin_Indyk\u002Fstatus\u002F1075500091711074305). “Wait, Wasn’t he supposed to be the most pro-Israel president in history?” In a storm of tweets, Trump defended his decisions. “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting *NOTHING*{: .small} but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?” he [wrote](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FrealDonaldTrump\u002Fstatus\u002F1075721703421042688), on Thursday. “Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight….Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight *ISIS*{: .small} and others, who they hate, without us.”\n\n \n\nThe timing of the two withdrawals may have been unexpected, but the decisions reflect the diminishing—critics claim unravelling—U.S. commitment in the Middle East and neighboring South Asia. “The region is still important, but not as critically important to us as it was ten or fifteen or twenty years ago,” Jeffrey Feltman, a former U.S. Ambassador and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, told me. “Arab-Israeli issues used to be at the top of our agenda but aren’t anymore. The Egyptian relationship with Israel would continue whether the U.S. is there or not. We still have military stuff all over the place—Special Forces in Iraq and Yemen, a long military relationship with Jordan. We want preferential access to the Suez Canal. But it’s not a major footprint anymore.”\n\n \n\nTrump has his own reasons for downsizing. But the balance of power—in a region where the United States had the strongest influence for a half century—has actually been recalibrating since the end of the Bush Administration, a decade ago. In 2008, five years into the Iraq War, President George W. Bush signed an [agreement](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.factcheck.org\u002F2015\u002F08\u002Fbush-clinton-play-blame-game-in-iraq\u002F) to pull out U.S. forces. President Obama only went back into Iraq in 2014, after the rise of *ISIS*{: .small}. During the campaign, Trump said that he would never have gone into Iraq (although, in 2002, he made comments on Howard Stern’s radio show in support of the war) and that he kept U.S. troops in Syria because they were already there. The outside world, especially America’s allies, have seen it coming, gradually but clearly.\n\n \n\nThe troubled history of the U.S. presence in the Middle East and South Asia is the wider subtext: misunderstanding Iran and missing the scope of hatred for the shah in the seventies; misreading the rise of political Islam and policies that mobilized the first modern suicide bombers against American targets in the eighties; abandoning Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal, which allowed the Taliban to seize power in the nineties; the invasion of Iraq in the early twenty-first century, followed by a withdrawal that facilitated *ISIS*{: .small} sweeping across Iraq and Syria in 2014\\.\n\n \n\n“I had earlier thought we needed to stay in Syria,” Ryan Crocker, the former U.S. Ambassador in both Syria and Afghanistan, told me. “But, over the last six months, I’ve come to the conclusion that we’re not good enough and not smart enough to play the post-conflict game with our troops on the ground.” He pointed to the eighteen hundred U.S. Marines in Beirut—about the same size as the force today in Syria—dispatched as a [peacekeeping force](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnn.com\u002F2013\u002F06\u002F13\u002Fworld\u002Fmeast\u002Fbeirut-marine-barracks-bombing-fast-facts\u002Findex.html) after the Israeli invasion, in 1982\\. They ended up getting enmeshed in the civil war. A suicide truck bomber killed more than two hundred and forty Americans, to this day the largest loss of Marines in a single incident since Iwo Jima, during the Second World War.\n\n \n\n“Who were the dominant players in Beirut then? Iran and Syria and their proxies,” Crocker, who was based in Beirut when the Marines were there, said. “Who are the dominant players in Syria today? Iran, Russia and their proxies. We are just not positioned to win. If we go or if we stay, it won’t affect the outcome very much. If we stay, then we become a player in a post-conflict, six-dimensional game that we have no clue of what the rules are. What is it that we think a couple thousand troops configured to fight *ISIS*{: .small} can do post-conflict?”\n\n \n\nThe wisdom of Trump’s dual decisions to withdraw will probably be debated for decades. So will the core question of what the role of the United States should be in the world’s most volatile region—and, specifically, what actually works.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7981ab3335f580f166","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Syria","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"syria"},{"id":"5c2e1c7aee7fe02cbd16332d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Afghanistan","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"afghanistan"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d81ab3335f580f174","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Foreign Policy","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"foreign-policy"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da23","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Turkey","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"turkey"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.
