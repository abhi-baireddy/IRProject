Actress Alyssa Milano speaks at a protest outside the White House, July 17, 2018.
It’s one thing to adopt a poorly formed set of principles and foist them on others at every opportunity.
It’s another to apply those principles unflinchingly to one’s political opponents while giving allies a free pass.
In the wake of sexual-misconduct allegations against Joe Biden, whom Milano has endorsed for president, the #MeToo maven appears to have discovered the long-forgotten notion of due process.
Milano’s pro-due-process statement on the accusations against Biden is, in essence, the correct one, just as Biden’s recent defense of himself was justifiable.
