In reality, military intervention in the standoff in Venezuela will only display our hubris and incapacity to learn from mistakes.
Let's make one thing perfectly clear: Maduro's predecessor as president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, single-handedly wrecked the country's economy, and Maduro has made it far worse.
The world is not a single political entity ruled by the American president and policed by the American military.
How many times will the United States make the same mistake while refusing to learn any meaningful lesson at all?
All of the evidence of recent history points toward it being a task that exceeds the capacity of the United States.
