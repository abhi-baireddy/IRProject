Jose Gonzalez Carranza, a Gold Star widower deported and then returned to the U.S. by the Trump administrationThe Gold Star widower who was deported and then returned to the U.S. by the Trump administration recalled that as many as half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, “with guns drawn,” swarmed his car to arrest him in the dawn hours.
Gonzalez Carranza said he never got the notice to appear in court because ICE mailed it to the wrong address, and his failure to appear then triggered his deportation.
ICE won’t admit it, but it was publicly shamed into returning him to the U.S. ICE remains responsible, because Gonzalez Carranza could still be vulnerable to deportation.
“If the judge reopens the case, Hernandez will ask for his parole in place to be reinstated.”But Gonzalez Carranza is most concerned about his daughter, 12-year-old Evelyn.
Evelyn’s grandparents share joint custody of the girl with her father, so she was with them while Gonzalez Carranza was gone.
