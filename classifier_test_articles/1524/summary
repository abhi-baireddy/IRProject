Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told USA TODAY that Sirota started in an unofficial capacity on Feb. 20, less than one month ago.
The publication noted while helping Sanders' campaign, Sirota had blasted other Democrats vying for the White House.
Most of the examples cited by the publication were before Sirota started secretly advising Sanders' campaign.
Shakir, Sandersâ€™ campaign manager, told The Atlantic that Sirota had been helping the campaign in an advisory role before being brought on officially Tuesday.
Sirota told The Atlantic that his Twitter purge was the result of an "autodeleter that periodically and automatically deletes tweets."
