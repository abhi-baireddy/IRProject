The Invisible Guillotine These stumbles may be symptomatic of deeper issues at the heart of the cuarta transformación — the fourth transformation which AMLO promises will revolutionize Mexican politics and society.
On March 2, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) announced that AMLO’s first ninety days had “affected the confidence of investors” and therefore justified the downgrading of Mexico’s public debt from stable to negative.
But, as the cases of other left governments in Latin America have shown, making concessions to neoliberal capitalism is no guarantee that the invisible guillotine will not decapitate best-laid plans.
The challenge for the Mexican left in the coming months will be to find a way of working both with and against AMLO’s government.
After a hundred days, some sections of the Left have already written off AMLO’s government as hopelessly compromised.
