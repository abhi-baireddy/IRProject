In the last three paragraphs of the article, reporter Ken Dilanian writes:Schiff said he is particularly concerned about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the real estate development Cohen was pitching to the Kremlin while Trump was running for president.
He noted that when it first emerged that Cohen had emailed Putin’s office seeking help, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Pescov, said he never answered the email.
But it later emerged in court documents that an assistant to Pescov did respond, emailing Cohen and asking him to call, which he did.
“So here we had the Kremlin facilitating a cover up by the president of the United States,” Schiff said.
It seems the word “collusion” has come to be redefined to mean, in this context, some extremely specific and overt type of behavior which may indeed never happened, but it’s unclear why we should accept these word games.
