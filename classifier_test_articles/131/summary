The 5-4 ruling states federal officials may detain convicted immigrants indefinitely after they finish serving prison time, even years after.
Advocates had argued the law only allowed for detention immediately after immigrants were released from prison.
Tuesday's ruling reversed a lower court decision that had found the existing law to mean federal authorities must detain convicted immigrants within 24 hours of their release from criminal detention.
The Trump administration, however, said the government should be allowed to hold convicted noncitizens at any time - and the conservative-majority top court has agreed.
