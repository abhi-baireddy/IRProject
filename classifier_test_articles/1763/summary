The prototypes built as part of President Trump’s border wall competition were torn down Wednesday after officials said they had served their purpose and were standing in the way of building a new section of actual border fencing.
Mr. Trump had touted the prototypes as a major part of his campaign promise to build a border wall.
But it has been a black eye for Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly talked about the intricacies of fence design — often in contradictory terms.
The CBP official said they did learn lessons from the prototypes, such as additional methods for internally hardening bollards used in fencing.
In addition to those eight prototypes, another set was built on a separate Border Patrol site.
