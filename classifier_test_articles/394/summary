Biden, for his part, has offered several olive branches to the disaffected Sanders supporters.
Last month, the former vice president opted to adopt the bankruptcy proposal authored by his former rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
More than a few members of Sandersâ€™ movement have rejected the olive branches as not going far enough.
Some, in particular, are concerned about new sexual assault allegation leveled against the former vice president by former staffer Tara Reade as disqualifying.
Sanders, himself, appears to understand the predicament members of his one-time movement pose for Biden.
