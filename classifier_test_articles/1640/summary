Two Republican congressmen introduced proposals Tuesday designed to fix America's health care system through a variety of market-oriented reforms.
Despite recent efforts to the contrary—most prominently through the Affordable Care Act—the American health care system continues to suffer intractable issues of coverage and cost.
Personal expenditures on health care have also continued to rise, with costs reaching 18 percent of GDP in 2017.
The comprehensive bill, according to Westerman's office, "addresses major drivers of health care costs as well as obstacles hindering individuals from obtaining health insurance coverage."
It aims to do so through a bevy of changes to the health care market.
