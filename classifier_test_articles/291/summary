GOP senators push double-decker welfare programPresident Trump needs to be reelected in 2020, but the Republican Party makes it harder to do so when they mimic the lunatic Left.
They’re going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program.
They would be the ones who also haven’t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either.
So it’s another welfare program.
But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it doesn’t start up a new tax.
