As the “Four Necessity Valve Turners,” we felt compelled to take this necessary, nonviolent action in the face of the imminent threat of the climate crisis – which, according the United Nations’ October 2018 report, requires an immediate response.
Our intent was to responsibly call for a “timeout” from the pumping of poison through the heart of Mother Earth.
We were charged with a felony and a misdemeanor, and we intend to invoke the necessity defense at our trial.
Since 2016, about three dozen states across the country have considered bills and executive orders explicitly designed to stop dissent against the fossil fuel industry.
As for the Four Necessity Valve Turners, our case will be tried before a twelve-person jury, who will decide whether ours was an act of criminality or one of necessity.
