Tony Evers joined a growing number of Democratic governors by ordering his state’s National Guard troops to leave the U.S.-Mexico border.
Evers issued an executive order Monday that withdraws 112 National Guard troops from their posts along the southern border.
The first-term Democratic governor, while blasting President Donald Trump’s claims that a national crisis exists at the border, argued the issue is best left to Customs and Border Patrol.
“Therefore, there is no justification for the ongoing presence of Wisconsin National Guard personnel at the border.
“New Mexico will not take part in the president’s charade of border fearmongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops.”The withdrawals come as national Democrats are mobilizing against Trump’s emergency declaration for the southern border.
