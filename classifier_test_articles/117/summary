Mexico has, so far, resisted Trump Administration efforts to restrict or close portions of the United States-Mexico border over concerns about illegal immigration but, this weekend, Mexican authorities, concerned about the spread of coronavirus, are reportedly considering shutting the border themselves to prevent the infection from affecting Mexican border cities.
Speaking to press on Friday, Mexico’s health minister called the United States a “danger” to Mexicans who have yet to suffer from coronavirus in large numbers.
The United States has around 2,000 confirmed cases and there have been around 50 deaths so far from the virus.
“Because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus.
The United States ambassador to Mexico added that a new policy would be mutually beneficial to both the U.S. and Mexico, per Reuters.
