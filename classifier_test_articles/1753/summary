On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether a 40-foot Latin cross may be displayed on a traffic island in Bladensburg, Md.
The court is increasingly upholding government support for religion that is neutral in theory, even if it favors the majority religion in practice.
Kagan explained that Americans do not stand before their government as adherents to one religion or another but as citizens.
And she thus stands at a remove, based solely on religion, from her fellow citizens and her elected representatives.‚ÄùADADThe Bladensburg cross creates the same sort of differentiation among citizens, stratifying them on the basis of religion.
Jews or Muslims who drive by the monumental cross at the center of town will reasonably conclude that Bladensburg has a special relationship with its Christian citizens, one from which they are excluded.
