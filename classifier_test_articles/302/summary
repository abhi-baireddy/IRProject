Foreign nationals living illegally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, are eligible for financial assistance programs that are intended to help small businesses and families struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.
Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in conjunction with the Minneapolis City Council, announced earlier in April that more than $5 million would be allocated from the city’s coffers to help local residents and employers feeling the pinch from the coronavirus lockdown.
The rescue package specifically dedicates several million dollars to emergency housing assistance to low-income individuals.
To qualify for the emergency housing assistance program, a family must: live within Minneapolis city limits, have incomes of 30% of the area medium income or lower, and have experienced a “significant loss” of income from the COVID-19 emergency.
Gavin Newsom, who is already providing millions in economic assistance to businesses owned by illegal aliens, confirmed that he is in talks with state legislators to establish a “Disaster Relief Fund” for those living unlawfully in the state.
