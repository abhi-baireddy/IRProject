A local public library in Houston invited a drag queen who is a convicted child-sex offender to read books to children.
Houston Public Library officials didn't apologize for hosting Drag Queen Storytime, which is part of a national program.
Starnes reported a lawsuit was filed against the taxpayer-funded library in October calling for an end to the drag queen event.
"But we can all agree that it's inappropriate to have a sex offender.
And for someone to not do their due diligence, to have a sex offender entertaining children at the library."
