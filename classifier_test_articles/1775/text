At a Glance The polar bear turned up last week wandering around the village of Tilichiki.

It may have floated more than 400 miles on an ice floe from its habitat in Chukotka.

On Monday, it was tranquilized and flown home. A polar bear that may have floated more than 400 miles on an ice floe to a village in eastern Russia has been returned to its home.

The exhausted-looking animal was seen last week wandering around the village of Tilichiki on Kamchatka. It was 430 miles south of its usual habitat in Chukotka.

Locals were making the bear feel welcome, giving it fish, media reported.

Russian emergency authorities on Monday mounted an operation to return the bear. A member of the response team shot a tranquilizer at the bear and put it in a container and onto a helicopter which flew to the snow-covered Chukotka. The bear was then released into the wild.

Polar bears' dependence on sea ice makes them highly vulnerable to global warming. Shrinking Arctic ice cover could increasingly deprive them of their usual prey, seals.

"Due to climate change, the Arctic is getting warmer, hunting environment gets smaller and less convenient," said Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace. "The ice is receding, and polar bears look for new ways to survive. And the easiest way is coming to people."
