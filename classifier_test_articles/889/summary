After a ProPublica investigation raised questions about the technique, Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, computer science professor and leading forensic image analyst, and Sophie Nightingale, a postdoctoral researcher in image science, tested the bureau’s method and found several serious flaws.
The FBI’s issues with image analysis echo earlier controversies over other forensic techniques.
“This is one of many studies uncovering non-trivial error rates for forensic techniques,” Garrett said.
FBI examiners often analyze low-quality images from security cameras and “it is reasonable to expect that the reliability of this technique may degrade under real-world imaging conditions,” the authors wrote.
They argue that all image pattern analysis should undergo validation tests, performed by researchers independent of the FBI and other forensic laboratories.
