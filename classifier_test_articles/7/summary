As Mueller report release nears, White House prepares robust response: Sources The president's advisers are most worried about obstruction of justice findings.
Sources say the initial response will look much as it did when Mueller first transmitted the report to Barr late last month, which was expressing relief over Barrâ€™s general conclusions.
The president's two top White House lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Emmet Flood, are expected to be among the White House officials reading the report.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller walks past the White House after attending services at St. John's Episcopal Church, in Washington, March 24, 2019.
White House officials will review the report, brief the president, and then release a statement that will come from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
