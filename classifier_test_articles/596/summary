There is perhaps no foreign leader more in tune with Donald Trump than Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
It is unsurprising, therefore, that Bolsonaro, who took office in January, insisted that his first visit to a foreign capital be Washington, D.C., and Trump was eager to oblige.

The trip is meant to signal strengthened ties between two ideological allies, but the practical results will likely be limited.
