Top-rated Fox shows fixated Tuesday night on how recorded COVID-19 death totals are coming in lower than the initial projections and using that disparity to question the public health response to the coronavirus.
Fox personalities also suggested that the recorded death tolls under discussion are themselves inflated.
But in reality, the COVID-19 death toll is almost certainly an undercount, as many people dying with symptoms of the virus aren’t actually being tested for it.
And of course, all three Fox prime-time shows continued the network’s rampant promotion of the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.
The president has been live-tweeting Fox segments about the coronavirus, telling the public that he relies on the network for information about its spread, and even bringing Fox personalities like Ingraham into the White House to advise his administration.
