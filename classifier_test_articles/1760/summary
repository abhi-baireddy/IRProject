As the two leaders sat down again Thursday morning in Hanoi, Mr. Trump tried to play down short-term expectations.
Mr. Trump earlier in the day called Mr. Kim “my friend” on Twitter.
In 2017, Mr. Trump taunted Mr. Kim as “Little Rocket Man” when North Korea was launching test missiles and tensions over a possible shooting war soared across East Asia.
Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised Vietnam for its “thriving” economy as he signed a trade deal with Vietnamese leaders and sought to persuade Mr. Kim to follow Hanoi’s example.
“You really are an example of what can happen with good thinking,” Mr. Trump told Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong and other officials.
