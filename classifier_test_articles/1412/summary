Yesterday, President Trump said all Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes would be grounded due to safety concerns.
When you say standby…As in, you won't be flying on a Boeing 737 Max anytime soon.
China was actually the first country to make the call to ground the Boeing plane model.
I can only imagine the meetings going on at Boeing right now...Yeah...the 737 Max planes are its current bread and butter.
theSkimmBoeing is a leader in the aircraft industry – both with commercial planes (like the 737 Max) and military planes.
