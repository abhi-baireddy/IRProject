The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted on Wednesday to raise fares for New York City subway and bus riders in April.
But the agency says that higher fares will not solve its deep financial crisis.
The board voted to keep the base fare at $2.75 while eliminating the 5 percent bonus that riders receive when buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard.
On April 21, the price of a weekly MetroCard will rise to $33, up from $32.
The fare increase vote comes as state lawmakers decide whether to approve new revenue streams for the system.
