On Monday, IJR caught up with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who hasn’t officially declared his candidacy but sure is spending a lot of time in Iowa.

“I don’t see that as … I don’t … I haven’t made a decision about that because I’m not a candidate.
Brown’s been crisscrossing around the major 2020 primary states for weeks now on his “Dignity of Work Tour” and is set to travel to the major early primary state of South Carolina later this week.
“My presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it,” she added.
