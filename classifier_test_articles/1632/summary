Jefferson County, Colo., officials are looking for an 18-year-old who is considered “infatuated with [the] Columbine school shooting” and “armed and extremely dangerous," in relation to the " credible threat" made against Columbine High School and other Denver-area schools on Tuesday.
Jefferson County police say that Sol was last seen within county limits wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage-print pants, and black boots.
“Last night, Sol Pais traveled to Colorado and made threats in the Denver metropolitan area,” Jefferson County sheriff’s officials wrote on Facebook.
Mike Taplin, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said the office is working alongside federal authorities, including the FBI, in investigating the threat.
More than a dozen schools, including Columbine High School, have heightened their security and are under lockdown.
