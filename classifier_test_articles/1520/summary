Sudhin ThanawalaAssociated PressSAN FRANCISCO â€“ Roundup weed killer was a substantial factor in a California man's cancer, a jury determined Tuesday in the first phase of a trial that attorneys said could help determine the fate of hundreds of similar lawsuits.
Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.
A San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hardeman's trial is before a different judge and may be more significant.
Hardeman's attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.
