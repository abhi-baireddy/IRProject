“It’s that sort of behavior that I’m responsible for,” he said. “I’m responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you’re doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.”

Cohen Said It’s Possible Trump Was Compromised By A Foreign Agent

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) asked whether he believed Trump would cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency, a possibility special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“In your opinion and experience, would he have the potential to cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency at all costs?” Wasserman Schultz asked.

Cohen responded: “Yes.”

The former attorney said he wasn’t sure whether Trump colluded, but he did think there was “something odd about the back-and-forth praise” Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have offered each other.
