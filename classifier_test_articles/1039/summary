Like other Russian magnates, the U.S. government says Oleg Deripaska is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.
More recently, Deripaska and Manafort came into a financial dispute, with Deripaska charging that Manafort owes him millions of dollars.
Last year, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Deripaska and his company.
While the sanctions against Deripaska remain, they have been lifted from some of his largest holdings, after Deripaska agreed to reduce his stake and control in the firm.
Today, I sat down with Deripaska in Nizhny Novgorod, home to GAZ, Russia's largest maker of commercial vehicles, a company still under American sanctions.
