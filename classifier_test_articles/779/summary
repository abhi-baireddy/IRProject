But Devin Nunes has done the impossible and surpassed even Donald Trump in hypersensitivity.
Nunes, a Republican representative from California, filed a $250 million lawsuit on Monday against Twitter and a handful of users who criticized him, accusing them of negligence and defamation.
He even claims that the defendants are part of a grand conspiracy to cripple his political career.
If the lawsuit was intended to vindicate Nunes and his reputation, it has achieved precisely the opposite.
The others are unknown to him: the Twitter users responsible for anonymous parody accounts such as “Devin Nunes’ Mom,” “Devin Nunes’ Cow,” “Fire Devin Nunes,” and “Devin Nunes’ Grapes.”
