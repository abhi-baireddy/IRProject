The House voted 245 to 182 in favor of the resolution, with 13 House Republicans joining all Democrats to approve it.
With all 47 Senate Democrats expected to vote in favor, only four GOP senators would need to join them to ensure the resolution passes.
On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence addressed Senate Republicans’ weekly lunch to persuade them to back the president up.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a strong supporter of the emergency declaration, told The Daily Beast that Pence said the emergency declaration applies to a specific statute with a “limited application.” He predicted Pence’s talk may have moved some of his colleagues who are on the fence about how to vote.
Dampened enthusiasm on the right stems from anxiety among conservative activists that Trump’s emergency declaration could lay the groundwork for a Democratic administration to exploit.
