SANTA MONICA, California — Former Mexican president Vicente Fox suggested Wednesday that drug trafficking and violence at the border aren’t caused by Mexico, but by drug consumption in the United States.
“Drug traffic, I guess people here in the [United] States say, ‘These Mexicans have gone crazy.
“No, we’re in a drug war that is not ours.
We have accepted to collaborate with United States in trying to cut the drug trafficking, trying to impede the drug to reach the U.S. market.
“Lets get rid of that language of hate that this campaign has brought about, that’s not United States.
