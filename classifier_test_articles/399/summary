House Democrats overwhelming passed legislation on Tuesday designed to block President Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern border, Fox News reports.
“Tuesday’s vote marked the first time the House or Senate has tried to terminate a presidential declaration of a national emergency, using the provisions of the National Emergencies Act of 1976,” reports the outlet.
House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) condemned Trump’s national emergency declaration as a move that would “steal billions of dollars” from the U.S. military to build the Mexico border wall.
“If Republicans vote their beliefs, we’ll get a lot.
“I went down there neutral on this question, didn’t know whether or not I’d support a national emergency,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL).
