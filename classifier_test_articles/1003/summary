So much for the notion that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was finished when he abruptly ended his work and handed in a four hundred page report about Donald Trump.
Today, Mueller’s team handed off several key ongoing Trump-Russia related criminal cases.
Instead, the handoff means – on paper at least – that these cases, and Mueller’s other ongoing cases, are supposed to move forward full steam ahead without him.
This brings us back to the essential question we’ve been asking since it was announced that Robert Mueller was quitting and going home.
If this is all Barr’s doing, he may be planning to quietly shut these ongoing cases down, to whatever extent he can.
