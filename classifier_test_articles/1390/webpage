The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it. In a statement, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied that it had taken place.\n\nThe most legally significant aspect of Johnson’s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration. Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson’s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign’s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information “in any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.” Johnson’s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, “We expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.”\n\nThe White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump’s reëlection campaign. He said in a statement, “The campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.” Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. “I am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,” Johnson said, in an interview. “I am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.”\n\nNondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign [reportedly](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/03/22/memo-to-white-house-staff-keep-talking) required paid staff to sign such agreements, but Trump’s campaign seemed to use the agreements more widely, and even required unpaid volunteers to sign them. The practice has carried over to the Trump White House. The Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/everyone-signed-one-trump-is-aggressive-in-his-use-of-nondisclosure-agreements-even-in-government/2018/08/13/9d0315ba-9f15-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.b17b00786ee1) last year that dozens of White House aides had signed N.D.A.s, a break in tradition from previous Administrations, which used the contracts more sparingly. White House interns have also [reportedly](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-is-forcing-interns-to-sign-ndas-and-threatening-them-with-financial-ruin) been asked to sign the agreements as part of their mandatory “ethics training.”\n\nTwo former Trump advisers who had senior roles in the campaign said that workers were pressured into signing such agreements. Internal e-mails received by one of the former advisers repeatedly insist that “we must have that NDA.” The second adviser told me that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, “was tasked by Mr. Trump to insure that anyone and everyone working with the campaign, whether salaried employee, volunteer, surrogate, or otherwise, execute a nondisclosure agreement or they would be terminated immediately. They strong-armed people to sign.”\n\nThe first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. “They would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That’s where the red flags started,” the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser’s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were “always concerns” within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements.\n\nJohnson’s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit. The complaint acknowledges that “forcible kissing might appear at first glance to be on the lesser extreme” of misconduct, but it argues that the interaction meets common-law definitions of battery, a legal term referring to harmful or offensive contact.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Johnson joined the Trump campaign in January, 2016, as the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama, and that she held various positions in the ensuing months, eventually working as the administrative field-operations director in Florida. Johnson, who is African-American, asserts in her lawsuit that she was paid “substantially less” than other staff members with similar responsibilities because of her race and gender, and that campaign staffers made comments about race that made her uncomfortable. (One of those staffers disputed Johnson’s account, accusing her of having an “agenda.”) An analysis by the [Boston *Globe*](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/06/04/donald-trump-campaign-pays-women-less-than-men/VIu0v2MUJiHqhvc5C0W5dO/story.html) in June, 2016, found that female staffers on the Trump campaign were paid, on average, three-quarters what their male counterparts received.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\nThe incident in which Johnson said that Trump kissed her occurred during an event that she had helped organize in Tampa in August, 2016, according to the complaint. In an R.V. before Trump’s speech at the event, the complaint alleges, Trump took Johnson by the hand and leaned in to kiss her; she attempted to turn away, but, she claims, his mouth made contact with the corner of hers.\n\nIn her statement, Sarah Sanders said, “This accusation is absurd on its face. This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eyewitness accounts.” The two people who disputed Johnson’s account, Karen Giorno, a staffer, and Pam Bondi, a campaign surrogate, said that they had been close enough that they would likely have witnessed the incident. “I don’t even recall Alva being on the R.V.,” Giorno told me. (Photographs from the rally place Johnson inside the R.V.) Bondi, who said that she travelled with Trump extensively and never witnessed inappropriate behavior, added, “Had it happened, I feel I would have seen it, because I was there the entire time.”\n\nThree of Johnson’s family members—her partner, her mother, and her stepfather—said that she told them about the incident immediately afterward, and recalled that she was in tears. Johnson said that at first she continued to go to work. In October, 2016, the Washington *Post* released audio of Trump saying, “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” At that point, Johnson said, she saw the incident with Trump as part of a pattern. She said that she took several sick days and consulted an attorney, whom she told in a text message that Trump had kissed her. She also spoke with a therapist, whose notes state that “she was having nightmares because of what happened.” The attorney, Adam Horowitz, advised Johnson to notify the campaign that she was resigning. Shortly afterward, the campaign sent Johnson a termination letter.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, Johnson said, she wanted to “leave the incident in the past,” and she attended an inaugural ball and applied for a job in the Administration. She said she feared that the President or his supporters would attack her character if she filed a public complaint. (Johnson was arrested for marijuana possession in 2000, and in 2006 her sister and her father filed a motion for a protection order against her in family court in Georgia, after what her attorney said were heated arguments.)\n\nJohnson’s lawsuit is at least the fourth filed against Trump by women with complaints of unwanted physical advances. None of the previous suits have resulted in judgments against Trump, but settlement negotiations are ongoing in at least one. At least nine additional women have publicly claimed that Trump kissed them without their consent, but none of them have pursued legal action.\n\nJohnson’s complaint comes just days after Jessica Denson, who worked on the campaign as a national phone-bank administrator and then as a Hispanic-engagement director, filed a class-action claim seeking to invalidate nondisclosure and arbitration agreements signed by any Trump campaign workers. The claim, filed with the American Arbitration Association, argues that the contracts are too broad and represent an “unconscionable” restraint on employees with workplace complaints. In November, 2017, Denson sued the campaign in New York State Supreme Court, accusing one of her supervisors of “pervasive slander, aggravated harassment, attempted theft, cyberbullying and sexual discrimination and harassment.” Trump Organization lawyers then sought to enforce the agreements she had signed, which, they argued, prevented her from raising her complaint outside of private arbitration. The case has resulted in a protracted legal battle. Denson’s attorney, David Bowles, said that her claim was filed to defend “the rights of campaign workers to be free to speak, as they should be under the law.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to enforce the contracts have extended to the White House, despite the fact that many legal experts believe that public servants are exempt from sweeping nondisclosure agreements. Last week, Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House staffer, filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements violates the First Amendment. Trump’s campaign organization had filed an arbitration claim against Sims in response to an unflattering book that he wrote about his time in the Administration. Mark Zaid, an attorney whose firm currently represents Sims, said that the Trump Administration was applying private-sector tactics to the government in an unprecedented way.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are also engaged in an ongoing arbitration process with Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former White House staffer and a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” which they initiated after she published a book that accused the Administration of racism and misogyny. “They’re using N.D.A.s to suppress speech, to avoid accountability, and thus to avoid setting legal precedent,” Manigault Newman’s attorney, John Phillips, told me. He said that enforcement efforts as extensive as Trump’s had “never happened before in the government sector.”\n\nLegal experts said that Johnson’s case, and the broader pattern of high-profile legal skirmishes over Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements, could produce significant legal rulings and affect the President’s ability to enforce the contracts. “We now have the President of the United States trying to enforce nondisclosure agreements that are so over-broad they would keep secret illegal actions or keep information that’s in the public interest from the public,” Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida Law School who specializes in government transparency, said. “This is a moment of reckoning for excessive N.D.A.s.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n\n+++\n\n","articleSection":"news desk","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ronan

filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida on Monday, alleging that she experienced “racial and gender discrimination” while working for the campaign, that she was paid less than male and white colleagues, and that Trump once kissed her partially on the mouth, without her consent. The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it. In a statement, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied that it had taken place.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>The most legally significant aspect of Johnson’s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration. Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson’s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign’s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information “in any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.” Johnson’s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, “We expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.”</p><p>The White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump’s reëlection campaign. He said in a statement, “The campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.” Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. “I am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,” Johnson said, in an interview. “I am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.”</p><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>Nondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/03/22/memo-to-white-house-staff-keep-talking&quot;}" href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/03/22/memo-to-white-house-staff-keep-talking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> required paid staff to sign such agreements, but Trump’s campaign seemed to use the agreements more widely, and even required unpaid volunteers to sign them. The practice has carried over to the Trump White House.

White House interns have also <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-is-forcing-interns-to-sign-ndas-and-threatening-them-with-financial-ruin&quot;}" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-is-forcing-interns-to-sign-ndas-and-threatening-them-with-financial-ruin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> been asked to sign the agreements as part of their mandatory “ethics training.”</p><p>Two former Trump advisers who had senior roles in the campaign said that workers were pressured into signing such agreements. Internal e-mails received by one of the former advisers repeatedly insist that “we must have that NDA.” The second adviser told me that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, “was tasked by Mr. Trump to insure that anyone and everyone working with the campaign, whether salaried employee, volunteer, surrogate, or otherwise, execute a nondisclosure agreement or they would be terminated immediately. They strong-armed people to sign.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. “They would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That’s where the red flags started,” the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser’s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were “always concerns” within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements.</p><p>Johnson’s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit. The complaint acknowledges that “forcible kissing might appear at first glance to be on the lesser extreme” of misconduct, but it argues that the interaction meets common-law definitions of battery, a legal term referring to harmful or offensive contact.</p><p>The lawsuit says that Johnson joined the Trump campaign in January, 2016, as the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama, and that she held various positions in the ensuing months, eventually working as the administrative field-operations director in Florida. Johnson, who is African-American, asserts in her lawsuit that she was paid “substantially less” than other staff members with similar responsibilities because of her race and gender, and that campaign staffers made comments about race that made her uncomfortable. (One of those staffers disputed Johnson’s account, accusing her of having an “agenda.”) An analysis by the <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/06/04/donald-trump-campaign-pays-women-less-than-men/VIu0v2MUJiHqhvc5C0W5dO/story.html&quot;}" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/06/04/donald-trump-campaign-pays-women-less-than-men/VIu0v2MUJiHqhvc5C0W5dO/story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Boston <em>Globe</em></a> in June, 2016, found that female staffers on the Trump campaign were paid, on average, three-quarters what their male counterparts received.</p><inline-embed childTypes="image" name="feature-default"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="Various people standing in a line including thencandidate Donald Trump and Alva Johnson." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Farrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-InlineOnly.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">Alva Johnson, wearing a white shirt and standing back left, at a rally with Donald Trump in Tampa, Florida, on August 24, 2016.</span><span class="caption__credit">Photograph by Loren Elliott / Tampa Bay Times / Getty</span></figcaption></figure></inline-embed><p>The incident in which Johnson said that Trump kissed her occurred during an event that she had helped organize in Tampa in August, 2016, according to the complaint. In an R.V. before Trump’s speech at the event, the complaint alleges, Trump took Johnson by the hand and leaned in to kiss her; she attempted to turn away, but, she claims, his mouth made contact with the corner of hers.</p><div class="cne-interlude-embed"></div><p>In her statement, Sarah Sanders said, “This accusation is absurd on its face. This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eyewitness accounts.” The two people who disputed Johnson’s account, Karen Giorno, a staffer, and Pam Bondi, a campaign surrogate, said that they had been close enough that they would likely have witnessed the incident. “I don’t even recall Alva being on the R.V.,” Giorno told me. (Photographs from the rally place Johnson inside the R.V.) Bondi, who said that she travelled with Trump extensively and never witnessed inappropriate behavior, added, “Had it happened, I feel I would have seen it, because I was there the entire time.”</p><p>Three of Johnson’s family members—her partner, her mother, and her stepfather—said that she told them about the incident immediately afterward, and recalled that she was in tears. Johnson said that at first she continued to go to work. In October, 2016, the Washington <em>Post</em> released audio of Trump saying, “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” At that point, Johnson said, she saw the incident with Trump as part of a pattern. She said that she took several sick days and consulted an attorney, whom she told in a text message that Trump had kissed her. She also spoke with a therapist, whose notes state that “she was having nightmares because of what happened.” The attorney, Adam Horowitz, advised Johnson to notify the campaign that she was resigning. Shortly afterward, the campaign sent Johnson a termination letter.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><aside class="persistent-aside" style="position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></aside></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>After Trump’s election, Johnson said, she wanted to “leave the incident in the past,” and she attended an inaugural ball and applied for a job in the Administration. She said she feared that the President or his supporters would attack her character if she filed a public complaint. (Johnson was arrested for marijuana possession in 2000, and in 2006 her sister and her father filed a motion for a protection order against her in family court in Georgia, after what her attorney said were heated arguments.)</p><p>Johnson’s lawsuit is at least the fourth filed against Trump by women with complaints of unwanted physical advances. None of the previous suits have resulted in judgments against Trump, but settlement negotiations are ongoing in at least one. At least nine additional women have publicly claimed that Trump kissed them without their consent, but none of them have pursued legal action.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Johnson’s complaint comes just days after Jessica Denson, who worked on the campaign as a national phone-bank administrator and then as a Hispanic-engagement director, filed a class-action claim seeking to invalidate nondisclosure and arbitration agreements signed by any Trump campaign workers. The claim, filed with the American Arbitration Association, argues that the contracts are too broad and represent an “unconscionable” restraint on employees with workplace complaints. In November, 2017, Denson sued the campaign in New York State Supreme Court, accusing one of her supervisors of “pervasive slander, aggravated harassment, attempted theft, cyberbullying and sexual discrimination and harassment.” Trump Organization lawyers then sought to enforce the agreements she had signed, which, they argued, prevented her from raising her complaint outside of private arbitration. The case has resulted in a protracted legal battle. Denson’s attorney, David Bowles, said that her claim was filed to defend “the rights of campaign workers to be free to speak, as they should be under the law.”</p><p>Trump’s efforts to enforce the contracts have extended to the White House, despite the fact that many legal experts believe that public servants are exempt from sweeping nondisclosure agreements. Last week, Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House staffer, filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements violates the First Amendment. Trump’s campaign organization had filed an arbitration claim against Sims in response to an unflattering book that he wrote about his time in the Administration. Mark Zaid, an attorney whose firm currently represents Sims, said that the Trump Administration was applying private-sector tactics to the government in an unprecedented way.</p><p>Trump’s attorneys are also engaged in an ongoing arbitration process with Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former White House staffer and a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” which they initiated after she published a book that accused the Administration of racism and misogyny. “They’re using N.D.A.s to suppress speech, to avoid accountability, and thus to avoid setting legal precedent,” Manigault Newman’s attorney, John Phillips, told me. He said that enforcement efforts as extensive as Trump’s had “never happened before in the government sector.”</p><p>Legal experts said that Johnson’s case, and the broader pattern of high-profile legal skirmishes over Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements, could produce significant legal rulings and affect the President’s ability to enforce the contracts. “We now have the President of the United States trying to enforce nondisclosure agreements that are so over-broad they would keep secret illegal actions or keep information that’s in the public interest from the public,” Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida Law School who specializes in government transparency, said. “This is a moment of reckoning for excessive N.D.A.s.”</p></div><div class="grid--item

[Donald Trump’s](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) 2016 Presidential campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida on Monday, alleging that she experienced “racial and gender discrimination” while working for the campaign, that she was paid less than male and white colleagues, and that Trump once kissed her partially on the mouth, without her consent. The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it. In a statement, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied that it had taken place.\n\nThe most legally significant aspect of Johnson’s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration. Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson’s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign’s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information “in any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.” Johnson’s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, “We expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.”\n\nThe White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump’s reëlection campaign. He said in a statement, “The campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.” Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. “I am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,” Johnson said, in an interview. “I am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.”\n\nNondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign [reportedly](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.economist.com\u002Funited-states\u002F2018\u002F03\u002F22\u002Fmemo-to-white-house-staff-keep-talking) required paid staff to sign such agreements, but Trump’s campaign seemed to use the agreements more widely, and even required unpaid volunteers to sign them. The practice has carried over to the Trump White House. The Washington *Post* [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fpolitics\u002Feveryone-signed-one-trump-is-aggressive-in-his-use-of-nondisclosure-agreements-even-in-government\u002F2018\u002F08\u002F13\u002F9d0315ba-9f15-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.b17b00786ee1) last year that dozens of White House aides had signed N.D.A.s, a break in tradition from previous Administrations, which used the contracts more sparingly. White House interns have also [reportedly](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thedailybeast.com\u002Ftrump-white-house-is-forcing-interns-to-sign-ndas-and-threatening-them-with-financial-ruin) been asked to sign the agreements as part of their mandatory “ethics training.”\n\nTwo former Trump advisers who had senior roles in the campaign said that workers were pressured into signing such agreements. Internal e-mails received by one of the former advisers repeatedly insist that “we must have that NDA.” The second adviser told me that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, “was tasked by Mr. Trump to insure that anyone and everyone working with the campaign, whether salaried employee, volunteer, surrogate, or otherwise, execute a nondisclosure agreement or they would be terminated immediately. They strong-armed people to sign.”\n\nThe first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. “They would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That’s where the red flags started,” the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser’s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were “always concerns” within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements.\n\nJohnson’s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit. The complaint acknowledges that “forcible kissing might appear at first glance to be on the lesser extreme” of misconduct, but it argues that the interaction meets common-law definitions of battery, a legal term referring to harmful or offensive contact.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Johnson joined the Trump campaign in January, 2016, as the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama, and that she held various positions in the ensuing months, eventually working as the administrative field-operations director in Florida. Johnson, who is African-American, asserts in her lawsuit that she was paid “substantially less” than other staff members with similar responsibilities because of her race and gender, and that campaign staffers made comments about race that made her uncomfortable. (One of those staffers disputed Johnson’s account, accusing her of having an “agenda.”) An analysis by the [Boston *Globe*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bostonglobe.com\u002Fnews\u002Fpolitics\u002F2016\u002F06\u002F04\u002Fdonald-trump-campaign-pays-women-less-than-men\u002FVIu0v2MUJiHqhvc5C0W5dO\u002Fstory.html) in June, 2016, found that female staffers on the Trump campaign were paid, on average, three-quarters what their male counterparts received.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d7121cc63602cef2e3fa8]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\nThe incident in which Johnson said that Trump kissed her occurred during an event that she had helped organize in Tampa in August, 2016, according to the complaint. In an R.V. before Trump’s speech at the event, the complaint alleges, Trump took Johnson by the hand and leaned in to kiss her; she attempted to turn away, but, she claims, his mouth made contact with the corner of hers.\n\nIn her statement, Sarah Sanders said, “This accusation is absurd on its face. This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eyewitness accounts.” The two people who disputed Johnson’s account, Karen Giorno, a staffer, and Pam Bondi, a campaign surrogate, said that they had been close enough that they would likely have witnessed the incident. “I don’t even recall Alva being on the R.V.,” Giorno told me. (Photographs from the rally place Johnson inside the R.V.) Bondi, who said that she travelled with Trump extensively and never witnessed inappropriate behavior, added, “Had it happened, I feel I would have seen it, because I was there the entire time.”\n\nThree of Johnson’s family members—her partner, her mother, and her stepfather—said that she told them about the incident immediately afterward, and recalled that she was in tears. Johnson said that at first she continued to go to work. In October, 2016, the Washington *Post* released audio of Trump saying, “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” At that point, Johnson said, she saw the incident with Trump as part of a pattern. She said that she took several sick days and consulted an attorney, whom she told in a text message that Trump had kissed her. She also spoke with a therapist, whose notes state that “she was having nightmares because of what happened.” The attorney, Adam Horowitz, advised Johnson to notify the campaign that she was resigning. Shortly afterward, the campaign sent Johnson a termination letter.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, Johnson said, she wanted to “leave the incident in the past,” and she attended an inaugural ball and applied for a job in the Administration. She said she feared that the President or his supporters would attack her character if she filed a public complaint. (Johnson was arrested for marijuana possession in 2000, and in 2006 her sister and her father filed a motion for a protection order against her in family court in Georgia, after what her attorney said were heated arguments.)\n\nJohnson’s lawsuit is at least the fourth filed against Trump by women with complaints of unwanted physical advances. None of the previous suits have resulted in judgments against Trump, but settlement negotiations are ongoing in at least one. At least nine additional women have publicly claimed that Trump kissed them without their consent, but none of them have pursued legal action.\n\nJohnson’s complaint comes just days after Jessica Denson, who worked on the campaign as a national phone-bank administrator and then as a Hispanic-engagement director, filed a class-action claim seeking to invalidate nondisclosure and arbitration agreements signed by any Trump campaign workers. The claim, filed with the American Arbitration Association, argues that the contracts are too broad and represent an “unconscionable” restraint on employees with workplace complaints. In November, 2017, Denson sued the campaign in New York State Supreme Court, accusing one of her supervisors of “pervasive slander, aggravated harassment, attempted theft, cyberbullying and sexual discrimination and harassment.” Trump Organization lawyers then sought to enforce the agreements she had signed, which, they argued, prevented her from raising her complaint outside of private arbitration. The case has resulted in a protracted legal battle. Denson’s attorney, David Bowles, said that her claim was filed to defend “the rights of campaign workers to be free to speak, as they should be under the law.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to enforce the contracts have extended to the White House, despite the fact that many legal experts believe that public servants are exempt from sweeping nondisclosure agreements. Last week, Cliff Sims, a former Trump White House staffer, filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements violates the First Amendment. Trump’s campaign organization had filed an arbitration claim against Sims in response to an unflattering book that he wrote about his time in the Administration. Mark Zaid, an attorney whose firm currently represents Sims, said that the Trump Administration was applying private-sector tactics to the government in an unprecedented way.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are also engaged in an ongoing arbitration process with Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former White House staffer and a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” which they initiated after she published a book that accused the Administration of racism and misogyny. “They’re using N.D.A.s to suppress speech, to avoid accountability, and thus to avoid setting legal precedent,” Manigault Newman’s attorney, John Phillips, told me. He said that enforcement efforts as extensive as Trump’s had “never happened before in the government sector.”\n\nLegal experts said that Johnson’s case, and the broader pattern of high-profile legal skirmishes over Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements, could produce significant legal rulings and affect the President’s ability to enforce the contracts. “We now have the President of the United States trying to enforce nondisclosure agreements that are so over-broad they would keep secret illegal actions or keep information that’s in the public interest from the public,” Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida Law School who specializes in government transparency, said. “This is a moment of reckoning for excessive N.D.A.s.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n\n+++\n\n","articleSection":"news desk","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ronan Farrow","sameAs":"https:\u002F\u002Fthe-new-yorker.com\u002Fcontributor\u002Fronan-farrow\u002F"}],"dateModified":"2019-02-25T13:58:36.729","datePublished":"2019-02-25T09:08:00.000","headline":"A Lawsuit by a Campaign Worker Is the Latest Challenge to Trump’s Nondisclosure Agreements","image":["https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F2:1\u002Fw_2560,h_1280,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F2:2\u002Fw_1572,h_1572,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F16:9\u002Fw_2560,h_1440,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F4:3\u002Fw_2271,h_1703,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1705,h_1705,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg"],"keywords":["news desk","donald trump"],"thumbnailUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1705,h_1705,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fa-lawsuit-by-a-campaign-worker-is-the-latest-challenge-to-trumps-nondisclosure-agreements","isPartOf":{"@type":["CreativeWork","Product"],"name":"The New Yorker"},"isAccessibleForFree":false,"hasPart":[{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":"False","cssSelector":".paywall"}],"alternativeHeadline":"Ronan Farrow writes about a lawsuit brought against Donald Trump by Alva Johnson, a worker on his Presidential campaign.","description":"Ronan Farrow writes about a lawsuit brought against Donald Trump by Alva Johnson, a worker on his Presidential campaign.","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fa-lawsuit-by-a-campaign-worker-is-the-latest-challenge-to-trumps-nondisclosure-agreements"},"publisher":{"@context":"https:\u002F\u002Fschema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"The New Yorker","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fstatic\u002Ftny\u002Fassets\u002Flogo-seo.png","width":"500px","height":"117px"},"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com"}},"head.contentID":"5c732baef923155c5f0929b5","head.pageType":"article","head.photos":{"image-16-9":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F16:9\u002Fw_1000,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg","image-1-1":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F5c6d711c6e9f1a2c94009fe0\u002F1:1\u002Fw_1000,c_limit\u002FFarrow-TrumpCampaignLawsuit-PrimarySocial.jpg"},"linkBannerData":{"hed":"","dek":"","image":{},"links":[],"tracking":""},"navigation":{"aboutText":"The writers you love.

The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it.

Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson’s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign’s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information “in any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.” Johnson’s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, “We expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.”"],["p","The White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump’s reëlection campaign. He said in a statement, “The campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.” Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. “I am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,” Johnson said, in an interview. “I am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.”"],["native-ad",{"position":"in-content","shouldDisplayLabel":false}],["p","Nondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns.

They strong-armed people to sign.”"],["p","The first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. “They would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That’s where the red flags started,” the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser’s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were “always concerns” within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements."],["p","Johnson’s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit.

The claim, filed with the American Arbitration Association, argues that the contracts are too broad and represent an “unconscionable” restraint on employees with workplace complaints. In November, 2017, Denson sued the campaign in New York State Supreme Court, accusing one of her supervisors of “pervasive slander, aggravated harassment, attempted theft, cyberbullying and sexual discrimination and harassment.” Trump Organization lawyers then sought to enforce the agreements she had signed, which, they argued, prevented her from raising her complaint outside of private arbitration. The case has resulted in a protracted legal battle. Denson’s attorney, David Bowles, said that her claim was filed to defend “the rights of campaign workers to be free to speak, as they should be under the law.”"],["p","Trump’s efforts to enforce the contracts have extended to the White House, despite the fact that many legal experts believe that public servants are exempt from sweeping nondisclosure agreements.

June, 2006, [Donald Trump](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) taped an episode of his reality-television show, “[The Apprentice](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F31\u002Fthe-tv-that-created-donald-trump),” at the Playboy Mansion, in Los Angeles. Hugh Hefner, *Playboy’s* publisher, threw a pool party for the show’s contestants with dozens of current and former Playmates, including Karen McDougal, a slim brunette who had been named Playmate of the Year, eight years earlier. In 2001, the magazine’s readers voted her runner-up for “Playmate of the ’90s,” behind Pamela Anderson. At the time of the party, Trump had been married to the Slovenian model [Melania Knauss](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2016\u002F05\u002F09\u002Fwho-is-melania-trump) for less than two years; their son, Barron, was a few months old. Trump seemed uninhibited by his new family obligations. McDougal later wrote that Trump “immediately took a liking to me, kept talking to me - telling me how beautiful I was, etc. It was so obvious that a Playmate Promotions exec said, ‘Wow, he was all over you - I think you could be his next wife.’ ” \n\nTrump and McDougal began an affair, which McDougal later memorialized in an eight-page, handwritten document provided to *The New Yorker* by John Crawford, a friend of McDougal’s. When I showed McDougal the document, she expressed surprise that I had obtained it but confirmed that the handwriting was her own. \n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5a844f6db20dc01b917093b6]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe interactions that McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump, or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them. McDougal describes their affair as entirely consensual. But her account provides a detailed look at how Trump and his allies used clandestine hotel-room meetings, payoffs, and complex legal agreements to keep affairs—sometimes multiple affairs he carried out simultaneously—out of the press. \n\nOn November 4, 2016, four days before the election, [the *Wall Street Journal* reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Fnational-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380) that American Media, Inc., the publisher of the *National Enquirer*, had paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for exclusive rights to McDougal’s story, which it never ran. Purchasing a story in order to bury it is a practice that many in the tabloid industry call “catch and kill.” This is a favorite tactic of the C.E.O. and chairman of A.M.I., David Pecker, who describes the President as “[a personal friend](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F03\u002Fthe-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump).” As part of the agreement, A.M.I. consented to publish a regular aging-and-fitness column by McDougal. After Trump won the Presidency, however, A.M.I.’s promises largely went unfulfilled, according to McDougal. Last month, [the *Journal* reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Ftrump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678) that Trump’s personal lawyer had negotiated a separate agreement just before the election with an adult-film actress named Stephanie Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels, which barred her from discussing her own affair with Trump. Since then, A.M.I. has repeatedly approached McDougal about extending her contract. \n\nMcDougal, in her first on-the-record comments about A.M.I.’s handling of her story, declined to discuss the details of her relationship with Trump, for fear of violating the agreement she reached with the company. She did say, however, that she regretted signing the contract. “It took my rights away,” McDougal told me. “At this point I feel I can’t talk about anything without getting into trouble, because I don’t know what I’m allowed to talk about. I’m afraid to even mention his name.” \n\nA White House spokesperson said in a statement that Trump denies having had an affair with McDougal: “This is an old story that is just more fake news. The President says he never had a relationship with McDougal.” A.M.I. said that an amendment to McDougal’s contract—signed after Trump won the election—allowed her to “respond to legitimate press inquiries” regarding the affair. The company said that it did not print the story because it did not find it credible. \n\nSix former A.M.I. employees told me that Pecker routinely makes catch-and-kill arrangements like the one reached with McDougal. “We had stories and we bought them knowing full well they were never going to run,” Jerry George, a former A.M.I. senior editor who worked at the company for more than twenty-five years, told me. George said that Pecker protected Trump. “Pecker really considered him a friend,” George told me. “We never printed a word about Trump without his approval.” Maxine Page, who worked at A.M.I. on and off from 2002 to 2012, including as an executive editor at one of the company’s Web sites, said that Pecker also used the unpublished stories as “leverage” over some celebrities in order to pressure them to pose for his magazines or feed him stories. Several former employees said that these celebrities included Arnold Schwarzenegger, as reported by [Los Angeles Magazine](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.lamag.com\u002Flongform\u002Fthe-hush-hush-deal-that-made-arnold-schwarzenegger-governor\u002F), and [Tiger Woods](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F03\u002Fthe-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump). (Schwarzenegger, through an attorney, denied this claim. Woods did not respond to requests for comment.) “Even though they’re just tabloids, just rags, it’s still a cause of concern,” Page said. “In theory, you would think that Trump has all the power in that relationship, but in fact Pecker has the power—he has the power to run these stories. He knows where the bodies are buried.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAs the pool party at the Playboy Mansion came to an end, Trump asked for McDougal’s telephone number. For McDougal, who grew up in a small town in Michigan and worked as a preschool teacher before beginning her modelling career, such advances were not unusual. John Crawford, McDougal’s friend, who also helped broker her deal with A.M.I., said that Trump was “another powerful guy hitting on her, a gal who’s paid to be at work.” Trump and McDougal began talking frequently on the phone, and soon had what McDougal described as their first date: dinner in a private bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. McDougal wrote that Trump impressed her. “I was so nervous! I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man,” she wrote. “We talked for a couple hours – then, it was “ON”! We got naked + had sex.” As McDougal was getting dressed to leave, Trump did something that surprised her. “He offered me money,” she wrote. “I looked at him (+ felt sad) + said, ‘No thanks - I’m not ‘that girl.’ I slept w\u002Fyou because I like you - NOT for money’ - He told me ‘you are special.’ ” \n\nAfterward, McDougal wrote, she “went to see him every time he was in LA (which was a lot).” Trump, she said, always stayed in the same bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel and ordered the same meal—steak and mashed potatoes—and never drank. McDougal’s account is consistent with other descriptions of Trump’s behavior. Last month, *In Touch Weekly* published an interview conducted in 2011 with Stephanie Clifford in which she revealed that during a relationship with Trump she met him for dinner at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Trump insisted they watch “Shark Week” on the Discovery Channel. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” alleged that Trump assaulted her at a private dinner meeting, in December of 2007, at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Trump, Zervos has claimed, kissed her, groped her breast, and suggested that they lie down to “watch some telly-telly.” After Zervos rebuffed Trump’s advances, she said that he “began thrusting his genitals” against her. (Zervos recently sued Trump for defamation after he denied her account.) All three women say that they were escorted to a bungalow at the hotel by a Trump bodyguard, whom two of the women have identified as Keith Schiller. After Trump was elected, Schiller was appointed director of Oval Office Operations and deputy assistant to the President. Last September, John Kelly, acting as the new chief of staff, removed Schiller from the White House posts. (Schiller did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOver the course of the affair, Trump flew McDougal to public events across the country but hid the fact that he paid for her travel. “No paper trails for him,” she wrote. “In fact, every time I flew to meet him, I booked\u002Fpaid for flight + hotel + he reimbursed me.” In July, 2006, McDougal joined Trump at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship, at the Edgewood Resort, on Lake Tahoe. At a party there, she and Trump sat in a booth with the New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, and Trump told her that Brees had recognized her, remarking, “Baby, you’re popular.” (Brees, through a spokesman, denied meeting Trump or McDougal at the event.) At another California golf event, Trump told McDougal that Tiger Woods had asked who she was. Trump, she recalled, warned her “to stay away from that one, LOL.” \n\nDuring the Lake Tahoe tournament, McDougal and Trump had sex, she wrote. He also allegedly began a sexual relationship with Clifford at the event. (A representative for Clifford did not respond to requests for comment.) In the 2011 interview with *In Touch Weekly*, Clifford said that Trump didn’t use a condom and didn’t mention sleeping with anyone else. Another adult-film actress, whose screen name is Alana Evans, claimed that Trump invited her to join them in his hotel room that weekend. A third adult-film performer, known as Jessica Drake, alleged that Trump asked her to his hotel room, met her and two women she brought with her in pajamas, and then “grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking for permission.” He then offered Drake ten thousand dollars in exchange for her company. (Trump denied the incident.) A week after the golf tournament, McDougal joined Trump at the fifty-fifth Miss Universe contest, in Los Angeles. She sat near him, and later attended an after-party where she met celebrities. Trump also set aside tickets for Clifford, as he did at a later vodka launch that both women attended.\n\nDuring Trump’s relationship with McDougal, she wrote, he introduced her to members of his family and took her to his private residences. At a January, 2007, launch party in Los Angeles for Trump’s now-defunct liquor brand, Trump Vodka, McDougal, who was photographed entering the event, recalled sitting at a table with Kim Kardashian, Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Trump, Jr.,’s wife, Vanessa, who was pregnant. At one point, Trump held a party for “The Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion, and McDougal worked as a costumed Playboy bunny. “We took pics together, alone + with his family,” McDougal wrote. She recalled that Trump said he had asked his son Eric “who he thought was the most beautiful girl here + Eric pointed me. Mr. T said ‘He has great taste’ + we laughed!” Trump gave McDougal tours of Trump Tower and his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. In Trump Tower, McDougal wrote, Trump pointed out Melania’s separate bedroom. He “said she liked her space,” McDougal wrote, “to read or be alone.” \n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5a844f6d08ed787fc1cfd102]||||||\n\n+++\n\nMcDougal’s account, like those of Clifford and other women who have described Trump’s advances, conveys a man preoccupied with his image. McDougal recalled that Trump would often send her articles about him or his daughter, as well as signed books and sun visors from his golf courses. Clifford recalled Trump remarking that she and [Ivanka](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fivanka-trump) were similar and proudly showing her a copy of a “money magazine” with his image on the cover.\n\nTrump also promised to buy McDougal an apartment in New York as a Christmas present. Clifford, likewise, said that Trump promised to buy her a condo in Tampa. For Trump, showing off real estate and other branded products was sometimes a prelude to sexual advances. Zervos and a real-estate investor named Rachel Crooks have both claimed that Trump kissed them on the mouth during professional encounters at Trump Tower. Four other women have claimed that Trump forcibly touched or kissed them during tours or events at [Mar-a-Lago](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F03\u002F20\u002Fthe-foreign-workers-of-mar-a-lago), his property in Palm Beach, Florida. (Trump has denied any wrongdoing pertaining to the women.)\n\nMcDougal ended the relationship in April, 2007, after nine months. According to Crawford, the breakup was prompted in part by McDougal’s feelings of guilt. “She couldn’t look at herself in the mirror anymore,” Crawford said. “And she was concerned about what her mother thought of her.” The decision was reinforced by a series of comments Trump made that McDougal found disrespectful, according to several of her friends. When she raised her concern about her mother’s disapproval to Trump, he replied, “What, that old hag?” (McDougal, hurt, pointed out that Trump and her mother were close in age.) On the night of the Miss Universe pageant McDougal attended, McDougal and a friend rode with Trump in his limousine and the friend mentioned a relationship she had had with an African-American man. According to multiple sources, Trump remarked that the friend liked “the big black dick” and began commenting on her attractiveness and breast size. The interactions angered the friend and deeply offended McDougal. \n\nSpeaking carefully for fear of legal reprisal, McDougal responded to questions about whether she felt guilty about the affair, as her friends suggested, by saying that she had found God in the last several years and regretted parts of her past. “This is a new me,” she told me. “If I could go back and do a lot of things differently, I definitely would.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMcDougal readily admitted that she voluntarily sold the rights to her story, but she and sources close to her insisted that the way the sale unfolded was exploitative. Crawford told me that selling McDougal’s story was his idea, and that he first raised it when she was living with him, in 2016. “She and I were sitting at the house, and I’m watching him on television,” Crawford said, referring to Trump. “I said, ‘You know, if you had a physical relationship with him, that could be worth something about now.’ And I looked at her and she had that guilty look on her face.” \n\nMcDougal, who says she is a Republican, told me that she was reluctant at first to tell her story, because she feared that other Trump supporters might accuse her of fabricating it, or might even harm her or her family. She also said that she didn’t want to get involved in the heated Presidential contest. “I didn’t want to influence anybody’s election,” she told me. “I didn’t want death threats on my head.” Crawford was only able to persuade her to consider speaking about the relationship after a former friend of McDougal’s began posting about the affair on social media. “I didn’t want someone else telling stories and getting all the details wrong,” McDougal said.\n\nCrawford called a friend who had worked in the adult-film industry who he thought might have media connections, and asked whether a story about Trump having an affair would “be worth something.” That friend, Crawford recalled, was “like a hobo on a ham sandwich” and contacted an attorney named Keith M. Davidson, who also had contacts in the adult-film industry and ties to media companies, including A.M.I. Davidson had developed a track record of selling salacious stories. A slide show on the clients page of his Web site includes Sara Leal, who claimed to have slept with the actor Ashton Kutcher while he was married to Demi Moore. Davidson told Crawford that McDougal’s story would be worth “millions.” (Davidson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nDozens of pages of e-mails, texts, and legal documents obtained by *The New Yorker* reveal how the transaction evolved. Davidson got in touch with A.M.I., and on June 20, 2016, he and McDougal met Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer. E-mails between Howard and Davidson show that A.M.I. initially had little interest in the story. Crawford said that A.M.I.’s first offer was ten thousand dollars.\n\nAfter Trump won the Republican nomination, however, A.M.I. increased its offer. In an August, 2016, e-mail exchange, Davidson encouraged McDougal to sign the deal. McDougal, worried that she would be prevented from talking about a Presidential nominee, asked questions about the nuances of the contract. Davidson responded, “If you deny, you are safe.” He added, “We really do need to get this signed and wrapped up...”\n\n+++\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5a844f6d4144c10f1dec36e9]||||||\n\n+++\n\nMcDougal, who has a new lawyer, Carol Heller, told me that she did not understand the scope of the agreement when she signed it. “I knew that I couldn’t talk about any alleged affair with any married man, but I didn’t really understand the whole content of what I gave up,” she told me. \n\nOn August 5, 2016, McDougal signed a limited life-story rights agreement granting A.M.I. exclusive ownership of her account of any romantic, personal, or physical relationship she has ever had with any “then-married man.” Her retainer with Davidson makes explicit that the man in question was Donald Trump. In exchange, A.M.I. agreed to pay her a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The three men involved in the deal—Davidson, Crawford, and their intermediary in the adult-film industry—took forty-five per cent of the payment as fees, leaving McDougal with a total of eighty-two thousand five hundred dollars, billing records from Davidson’s office show. “I feel let down,” McDougal told me. “I’m the one who took it, so it’s my fault, too. But I didn’t understand the full parameters of it.” McDougal terminated her representation by Davidson, but a photograph of McDougal in a bathing suit is still featured prominently on his Web site—according to McDougal, without her permission. The *Wall Street Journal* reported that, two months after McDougal signed the agreement with A.M.I., Davidson negotiated a nondisclosure agreement between Clifford and Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars. (On Tuesday, [Cohen told the *Times*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F14\u002Fus\u002Fpolitics\u002Fstormy-daniels-michael-cohen-trump.html) that he had facilitated the deal with Daniels and paid the money out of his own pocket. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAs voters went to the polls on Election Day, Howard and A.M.I.’s general counsel were on the phone with McDougal and a law firm representing her, promising to boost McDougal’s career and offering to employ a publicist to help her handle interviews. E-mails show that, a year into the contract, the company suggested it might collaborate with McDougal on a skin-care line and a documentary devoted to a medical cause that she cares about, neither of which has come about. The initial contract also called for A.M.I. to publish regular columns by McDougal on aging and wellness, and to “prominently feature” her on two magazine covers. She has appeared on one cover and is in discussions about another, but in the past seventeen months the company has published only a fraction of the almost one hundred promised columns. “They blew her off for a long time,” Crawford said. A.M.I. said that McDougal had not delivered the promised columns.  \n\nA.M.I.  responded quickly, however, when journalists tried to interview McDougal. In May, 2017, *The New Yorker’s* Jeffrey Toobin, who was writing [a profile of David Pecker](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F03\u002Fthe-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump), asked McDougal for comment about her relationships with A.M.I. and Trump. Howard, of A.M.I., working with a publicist retained by the company, forwarded McDougal a draft response with the subject line “SEND THIS.” In August, 2017, Pecker flew McDougal to New York and the two had lunch, during which he thanked her for her loyalty. A few days later, Howard followed up by e-mail, summarizing the plans that had been discussed, including the possibility of McDougal hosting A.M.I.’s coverage of awards shows such as the Golden Globes, Grammys, and Oscars. None of that work materialized. (A.M.I. said that those conversations related to future contracts, not her current one.) \n\nA.M.I.’s interest in McDougal seemed to increase after news broke of Trump’s alleged affair with Clifford. Howard sent an e-mail suggesting that McDougal undergo media training, and a few days later suggested that she could host coverage of the Emmys for *OK! Magazine*. In an e-mail on January 30th, A.M.I.’s general counsel, Cameron Stracher, talked about renewing her contract and putting her on a new magazine cover. The subject line of the e-mail read, “McDougal contract extension.” Crawford told me, “They got worried that she was going to start talking again, and they came running to her.” \n\nSeveral people close to McDougal argued that such untold stories could be used as leverage against the President. “I’m sixty-two years old,” Crawford said. “I know how the world goes round.” Without commenting on Trump specifically, McDougal conceded that she had a growing awareness of the broader implications of the President’s situation. “Someone in a high position that controls our country, if they can influence him,” she said, “it’s a big deal.” In a statement, A.M.I. denied that it had any leverage over Trump: “The suggestion that AMI holds any influence over the President of the United States, while flattering, is laughable.” \n\nMcDougal fears that A.M.I. will retaliate for her public comments by seeking financial damages in a private arbitration process mandated by a clause of her contract. But she said that changes in her life and the emergence of the [#MeToo](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fculture\u002Fculture-desk\u002Fthe-rising-pressure-of-the-metoo-backlash) moment had prompted her to speak. In January, 2017, McDougal had her breast implants removed, citing declining health that she believed to be connected to the implants. McDougal said that confronting illness, and embracing a cause she wanted to speak about, made her feel increasingly conflicted about the moral compromises of silence. “As I was sick and feeling like I was dying and bedridden, all I could do was pray to live. But now I pray to live right, and make right with the wrongs that I have done,” she told me. McDougal also cited the actions of women who have come forward in recent months to describe abuses by high-profile men. “I know it’s a different circumstance,” she said, “but I just think I feel braver.” McDougal told me that she hoped speaking out might convince others to wait before signing agreements like hers. “Every girl who speaks,” she said, “is paving the way for another.”\n\n*Due to editing errors, an earlier version of this story misstated the legal name of the adult-film actress Alana Evans and the publication that first reported allegations that A.M.I. used unpublished stories as leverage over Arnold Schwarzenegger. The number of published McDougal columns has also been updated.*

conference room in an office building at the tip of lower Manhattan, David Pecker decides what will be on the cover of the following week’s _National Enquirer_. Pecker is the longtime chief executive of American Media, Inc., which owns most of the nation’s supermarket tabloids and gossip magazines, including the _Star_, the _Globe_, the _Examiner_, and _OK!_, as well as the flagship _Enquirer_. Pecker’s tabloids have few subscribers and minimal advertising. Virtually all their revenue comes from impulse purchases at the checkout counter. A successful _Enquirer_ cover can drive sales fifteen per cent above the weekly average of three hundred and twenty-five thousand copies, and a lemon can hurt sales just as badly, so the choice of cover headlines and photographs represents a nearly existential challenge every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker started in the media business as an accountant, and he has attempted to impose a numbers-based rigor on the raucous world of tabloids. In the past decade, he has devised a proprietary database of the covers of all celebrity magazines, including those of his competitors. The “cover explorer,” as it’s known internally, tells A.M.I. executives how each cover sold in comparison with the magazine’s four- and thirteen-week averages. The explorer is indexed by celebrities and, uniquely, by words in the headlines. Pecker knows with some precision which stars sell (Kelly Ripa, Jennifer Aniston, Brad and Angelina, and, for the older generation, Dolly Parton and the Kennedys), and which phrases draw readers (headlines with the words “sad last days” and “six months to live”).\n\n\n\nTo open a recent meeting, Pecker, who was calling in on speakerphone from Dallas, asked Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer, to review the competition’s covers from the previous week. Howard, an ebullient Australian, is thirty-five, and something of a tabloid prodigy. He made his name with a three-year quest to prove that the actor Charlie Sheen had contracted H.I.V. (which Sheen ultimately acknowledged), and now supervises celebrity coverage for Pecker’s empire. Shuffling through a stack of magazines in front of him, Howard pulled out _Life & Style_, which is owned by Bauer, a German conglomerate. The issue featured Jennifer Lopez on the cover, with a headline claiming that she was expecting a child with her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez. “*Her ‘miracle’ baby at 47*{: .small}!” the cover announced. Howard dismissed the story. “She’s forty-seven,” he said. “Of course she’s not pregnant.” But there was another reason for Howard’s disdain. “J. Lo doesn’t sell,” he said.\n\n\n\nFor the forthcoming issue of the _Enquirer_, Howard presented a mockup of a cover on Megyn Kelly, who would be making her début as an NBC News correspondent the week that the issue went on sale. The headline read “*What she’s hiding*{: .small}!,” which Pecker praised because the phrase had worked well on another coverline, “*What Hillary’s Hiding*{: .small}!,” during the Presidential campaign. Bullet points under the Kelly headline promised revelations about plastic surgery and a “criminal past.”\n\n\n\nPecker believes in constant market research, so the _Enquirer_ conducts a rolling telephone poll in which it tests cover-story ideas, summarized in a sentence or two, on readers. Howard felt optimistic about the Kelly cover, because seventy-three per cent of respondents said that they would be interested in the story. “She got over seventy per cent, even without the benefit of seeing the cover image,” Howard said, referring to a high-school-yearbook photograph of Kelly with an eighties-style perm, which he felt would attract buyers.\n\n\n\nFor the “skyboxes,” the block headlines above the cover logo, Howard proposed an unflattering recent photograph of the actress Eva Longoria, which had tested at sixty-eight per cent, under the headline “*Packs on 40 pounds*{: .small}!” Howard explained, “We did ask the rep if she’s pregnant. Unfortunately for her, that just seems to be a burrito belly.” A photo in the other skybox was of Pamela Anderson, also in an unbecoming shot, who was, according to the headline, “*Destroyed by Plastic Surgery*{: .small}!” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5ed1d4663a811533aa]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker called on Cameron Stracher, the _Enquirer’s_ lawyer, to see if he anticipated any legal problems with the Kelly story. “We know she got the ‘comment call,’ ” Stracher said. At the _Enquirer_, these offers for comment on critical articles are routinely made to subjects and just as often declined. “It’s factually accurate,” Stracher continued. “She did have this surgery, she does have a criminal past, and the other stuff is opinion, really.” (In a recent memoir, Kelly acknowledged shoplifting, once, when she was twelve. So she was not “hiding” much at all.)\n\n\n\nAs the meeting wound down, the discussion turned to the following week’s issue. Someone suggested a story about a video from Donald and Melania Trump’s first overseas trip. The video, which had just gone viral, showed the couple walking down a red carpet on the airport tarmac in Israel. When Donald reached for Melania’s hand, she slapped it away with a sharp flick of her wrist.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t see that,” Pecker said, on the speakerphone.\n\n\n\nThe half-dozen or so men in the room exchanged looks. One then noted that the footage of Melania’s slap had received a good deal of attention.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t see that,” Pecker repeated, and the subject was dropped.\n\n\n\nIt was a telling moment. Even if the leader of a celebrity-news empire had missed the viral video from the President’s trip, Pecker’s decision to ignore the awkward moment for the First Family was not surprising. The _Enquirer_ is defined by its predatory spirit—its dedication to revealing that celebrities, far from leading ideal lives, endure the same plagues of disease, weight gain, and family dysfunction that afflict everyone else. For much of the tabloid’s history, it has specialized in investigations into the foibles of public personalities, including politicians. In 1987, the _Enquirer_ published a photograph of Senator Gary Hart with his mistress Donna Rice, in front of a boat called the Monkey Business, which doomed Hart’s Presidential candidacy. Two decades later, the magazine broke the news that John Edwards had fathered a child out of wedlock during his Presidential race. When Donald Trump decided to run for President, some people at the _Enquirer_ assumed that the magazine would apply the same scrutiny to the candidate’s colorful personal history. “We used to go after newsmakers no matter what side they were on,” a former _Enquirer_ staffer told me. “And Trump is a guy who is running for President with a closet full of baggage. He’s the ultimate target-rich environment. The _Enquirer_ had a golden opportunity, and they completely looked the other way.”\n\n\n\nThroughout the 2016 Presidential race, the _Enquirer_ embraced Trump with sycophantic fervor. The magazine made its first political endorsement ever, of Trump, last spring. Cover headlines promised, “*Donald Trump’s Revenge on Hillary & Her Puppets*{: .small}” and “*Top Secret Plan Inside: How Trump Will Win Debate*{: .small}!” The publication trashed Trump’s rivals, running a dubious cover story on Ted Cruz that described him as a philanderer and another highly questionable piece that linked Cruz’s father to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\n\nIt was even tougher on Hillary Clinton, regularly printing such headlines as “ *‘Sociopath’ Hillary Clinton’s Secret Psych Files Exposed*{: .small}!” A 2015 piece began, “Failing health and a deadly thirst for power are driving Hillary Clinton to an early grave, The _National Enquirer_ has learned in a bombshell investigation. The desperate and deteriorating 67-year-old won’t make it to the White House—because she’ll be dead in six months.” On election eve, the _Enquirer_ offered a special nine-page investigation under the headline “*Hillary: Corrupt*{: .small}! *Racist*{: .small}! *Criminal*{: .small}!” This blatantly skewed coverage continued after Trump took office. Post-election cover stories included “*Trump Takes Charge*{: .small}! *Success in just 36 days*{: .small}!” and “*Proof Obama Wiretapped Trump*{: .small}! *Lies, leaks & Illegal Bugging.*{: .small}” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5d2b807c41693f8f9c]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker and Trump have been friends for decades—their professional and personal lives have intersected in myriad ways—and Pecker acknowledges that his tabloids’ coverage of Trump has a personal dimension. All Presidents seek to influence the media, but Trump enjoys unusual advantages in this regard. He is also in close contact with Rupert Murdoch, whose empire includes Fox News and the _Wall Street Journal_. (While the _Times_ and the Washington _Post_ have produced repeated scoops about Trump and Russia, the _Journal_, which employs a large investigative staff, has largely been silent on the issue.) Unlike Murdoch, Pecker heads a fading and vaguely comic archetype of Americana; sales of the _Enquirer_ are down ninety per cent from their peak in 1970. But the impact of the tabloids, particularly their covers, remains substantial. A.M.I. claims that a hundred million people see the _Enquirer_ in more than two hundred thousand checkout lines around the country every week. And the _Enquirer’s_ covers invariably include statements about celebrities that are deeply misleading, if libel-law-compliant, as well as claims about politicians that are outright lies.\n\n\n\nPecker is now considering expanding his business: he may bid to take over the financially strapped magazines of Time, Inc., which include _Time_, _People_, and _Fortune_. Based on his stewardship of his own publications, Pecker would almost certainly direct those magazines, and the journalists who work for them, to advance the interests of the President and to damage those of his opponents—which makes the story of the _Enquirer_ and its chief executive a little more important and a little less funny.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI asked Pecker about Trump during our first lunch, at one of the posh Upper East Side restaurants that Pecker frequents. His fondness for long, wine-filled lunches is only one of the ways in which he resembles the media moguls of a bygone age. At a hale sixty-five, Pecker looks as though he could be heading out for a night at the disco. He sports the same kind of bushy mustache as the seventies porn star and period icon Harry Reems. Pecker combs his luxuriant hair straight back over the collars of his monogrammed shirts. He collects sports cars and high-end wristwatches. Still, he feels that the key to the success of the _Enquirer_ is his engagement with his down-market readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker said that the _Enquirer’s_ support of Trump is a straightforward response to its audience. Since January, 2016, _Enquirer_ issues with Trump as the main image have sold between two and fifteen per cent more than the weekly average for non-Trump covers. “They voted for Trump,” Pecker told me, speaking of his readers. “And ninety-six per cent want him reëlected today. That’s the correlation. These are white working people, who love to see takedowns of celebrities, and they want to see—which is unusual, who would think these people would love a billionaire?—the billionaire’s pulpit. They know him from fourteen seasons on ‘The Apprentice’ as the boss, and they loved it when he fired those people and ridiculed them.” Pecker conveyed this admiration to Trump directly: “I’d tell him every time I’d see him. I’d say, ‘Who cares about governor or mayor, you should be President. They love you. These people love you.’ ”\n\n\n\nPecker is eager to use his media empire to help his friends, especially Trump, and unabashedly boasts about doing so. Earlier this year, he bought _US Weekly_, the glossy celebrity magazine, from Wenner Media. (Last week, A.M.I. also bought _Men’s Journal_ from Wenner.) He negotiated the sale primarily with twenty-six-year-old Gus Wenner, the heir apparent of the company, which was co-founded by his father, Jann. “After my first lunch with David, I called up my brother and said, ‘This guy belongs in the Smithsonian,’ ” Gus Wenner told me. “He is the type of character you just don’t come across anymore. The way he operates, the way he does business—it’s completely honorable, but it feels of another era.” The lunch took place at Le Bernardin, one of New York’s temples of haute cuisine, where Pecker is a favorite customer. “When I get there, he’s drinking champagne, and our deal isn’t even done yet,” Wenner said. “And then Éric Ripert, the chef, comes to our table, and he tells us he is working on a TV project. David says to him, ‘We should talk. I could get you some ink.’ It was all very transactional.”\n\n\n\nWenner was curious to hear about Pecker’s relationship with the President. “I thought I would have to pull it out of him smoothly,” he said. “But he offered it up pretty readily, and I was all ears. He was painting Donald as extremely loyal to him, and he had no issue being loyal in return. He told me very bluntly that he had killed all sorts of stories for Trump. He hired a girl to be a columnist when she threatened to go public with a story about Donald.” \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F594d5e5eff36f87032dc1989]|||\n\nThe readers of the National Enquirer love stories about celebrities plagued by disease, weight gain, and family dysfunction. “These are people that live their life failing,” Pecker said. “So they want to read negative things about people who have gone up and then come down.” *Photograph by Mark Peterson \u002F Redux for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker denies telling Wenner that he killed stories for Trump or that he hired a columnist in order to suppress a story about Trump. Nevertheless, last year the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Fnational-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380) that Pecker paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a woman named Karen McDougal, who had alleged that she had a months-long romantic relationship with Trump, beginning in 2006, during his marriage to Melania.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Pecker about McDougal, who was _Playboy’s_ Playmate of the Year in 1998, he told me that he first met her when she modelled for the cover of _Men’s Fitness_, another A.M.I. magazine. “When her people contacted me that she had a story on Trump, everybody was contacting her,” he said. “At the same time, she was launching her own beauty-and-fragrance line, and I said that I’d be very interested in having her in one of my magazines, now that she’s so famous.” But Pecker had a condition for hiring her: “Once she’s part of the company, then on the outside she can’t be bashing Trump and American Media.”\n\n\n\nI pointed out that bashing Trump was not the same as bashing American Media.\n\n\n\n“To me it is,” Pecker replied. “The guy’s a personal friend of mine.”\n\n\n\nI e-mailed McDougal, who declined to discuss the matter, writing, “I don’t really like to talk about things other than my interests and passions—and that’s health, wellness, etc, etc!!”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThere are still traces of David Pecker’s Bronx boyhood in his accent and his attitude. He grew up on a Jewish block in a mostly Italian neighborhood until the family moved to New Rochelle, in Westchester County. His parents were older and unwell. His father, a bricklayer, died in 1967, when David was sixteen, and David needed to work to support his mother. He started bookkeeping for local businesses, including some of the rougher-edged outfits from his old neighborhood in the Bronx. By the end of his college days, at Pace University, he was making about two thousand dollars a month, a substantial sum in the late nineteen-sixties. One of his clients was an excavating contractor who couldn’t get a license to buy explosives, because he had a criminal record. “I was the one who was able to get the license, and I received the Dynomax in the Bronx,” Pecker told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter passing the C.P.A. exam, Pecker went to work as an accountant for CBS, which during the seventies had a magazine division that included _Car & Driver_, _Road & Track_, _Field & Stream_, and _Modern Bride_. He moved up the ranks at CBS but chafed against the bureaucratic culture. “You could not go to the bathroom there without getting permission from somebody first,” he told me. “You couldn’t give your secretary a dollar raise, you couldn’t do anything.”\n\n\n\nIn 1987, Pecker made a deal with an entrepreneur named Peter Diamandis to buy out CBS’s magazines, some of which they sold to Hachette, a French conglomerate that owned such magazines as _Paris Match_ and _Elle_, and also manufactured fighter planes. At Hachette, Pecker set out to learn about the sales, marketing, and manufacturing sides of the magazine business. Notably, he never worked as a journalist, an omission that has led him to disdain certain conventions. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5d2b807c41693f8f9b]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn 1990, Pecker was named the president of Hachette, which later bought _Premiere_, a movie magazine, with the financier Ronald Perelman. In 1996, after Perelman questioned a _Premiere_ investigation about financial problems at Planet Hollywood, a company to which Perelman had business ties, Pecker killed the story. “The last time I looked, I am the C.E.O. of this company,” Pecker told a reporter. When I asked him about the contretemps, Pecker explained it as a financial decision. “I called the editor up and I said, ‘Why are we doing an investigative piece on Planet Hollywood, when this is supposed to be a film magazine?’ ” He told the editor that he had spent two hundred thousand dollars on a research study showing that every time the magazine did an investigative piece sales went down. “I said, ‘I don’t really feel that this is appropriate.’ So he calls a news conference, resigns, and the whole staff is upset.” The actor Kevin Costner even joined in the protest, refusing to appear on the cover of the magazine. Pecker said that he told Costner, “It’s a coveted thing to be on the cover of _Premiere_ magazine. John Travolta took it in a second.”\n\n\n\nPecker quickly earned a reputation for producing magazines more cheaply than his competitors could. He also invested in new projects, including _George_, a political magazine founded, in 1995, by John F. Kennedy, Jr. “Hachette seemed like a different kind of place than some of the other publishing companies,” Michael Berman, Kennedy’s partner on _George_ and now the head of the investment firm Galaxy Partners, told me. “It was a little grittier than most, a little more bottom-line-oriented at the time. Not a lot of bells and whistles. Since we were going to be owners as well as implementing it, we liked that there was attention to the bottom line.” _George_ got off to a fast start but ultimately foundered after Kennedy’s death, in a plane crash, in 1999.\n\n\n\nPecker has no strong political views, but he has a fascination with, and a reverence for, celebrity. Recalling his first meeting with Kennedy, Pecker told me, “It was February, he comes up on his bike, he’s outside, he has his hat over his head, he comes inside, he takes off his coat, he has a beautiful Armani suit on, and he pulled his cap off and it was like he never even had to comb his hair! I don’t understand it. I mean, every hair was perfect. Every hair was perfect!” Pecker met Trump around the time he launched _George_, and his relationship with the developer resembled his connection to Kennedy. Talking about an early visit to Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s estate in Palm Beach, where he was pitching advertisers on _George_, Pecker described Trump’s then wife, Marla Maples: “I have never in my entire life seen a more beautiful woman in a bodysuit than Marla Maples. I mean, seriously, out of ten she was a fifteen.” For Pecker, Trump represented an aspirational figure in every dimension of life: in his glamour, his wealth, his access to beautiful women, and his style of living.\n\n\n\nPecker created a custom-publishing division at Hachette, producing magazines for clients who would dictate the content and then distribute them to customers. The first, _Sony Style_, was made for the electronics company. Pecker’s next idea was for a magazine about Donald Trump. Pecker had a home in Palm Beach, not far from Mar-a-Lago, and a neighbor there introduced him to Trump, who agreed to the project. The result was a magazine called _Trump Style_, which today looks like a glossy preview of the coverage Pecker later gave Trump in his tabloids. Representative samples include “Trump Tower, with its bronze façade and swaths of rose marble, combines New York City’s most glittering destination with shops both popular and posh”; “40 and Fabulous: Donald Trump’s latest real estate venture, a landmark office building at 40 Wall Street, could not be in a better location”; “A weekend at Trump Taj Mahal can’t help but be an exhilarating exercise in glamour and fun.” The magazine came out for five years and was, according to Pecker, “very successful.”\n\n\n\nIn the late nineties, just before the dot-com boom, money managers still regarded print magazines as a market for growth. In early 1999, the private-equity firm Evercore went looking for media opportunities and came upon American Media, Inc. Evercore recruited Pecker both as an investor and as the chief executive of the company, and closed a seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-million-dollar deal for A.M.I. in March of that year. A.M.I. owned a number of magazines, but its core asset was the _Enquirer_. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5eebd5596cf6186365]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe _Enquirer_ has unapologetically paid for interviews and photographs since the days of its founder, Generoso Pope, Jr. Pope’s immigrant father published the highly successful Italian-American newspaper _Il Progresso_, and Pope grew up in luxury. He was driven to school at Horace Mann in a limousine each morning, often accompanied by his friend and classmate Roy Cohn. (Cohn later became an aide to Joseph McCarthy and a mentor to Donald Trump; he represented Trump in the 1973 Justice Department case that accused his company of violating the Fair Housing Act.) According to “[The Godfather of Tabloid](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002Fdp\u002FB0049ENHMQ\u002Fref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” by Jack Vitek, Pope breezed through M.I.T. and did a brief stint in the C.I.A., then in its infancy, before returning, in 1952, to New York, where he struck out on his own, buying a moribund Hearst weekly and rechristening it the _National Enquirer_.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope was a dour and mysterious character, who exerted almost total control over the _Enquirer_ for thirty-six years. The early days, during which he attempted to brand the _Enquirer_ as a serious, upscale weekly, were rocky. As Pope later told the tale, he had an epiphany one day when he found himself gazing at a particularly gruesome traffic accident, and noticed how many other people had also stopped to stare. “It suddenly hit me,” Pope recalled. “That’s what people want to see. That’s what I’ll give them, blood and gore.”\n\n\n\nIn the fifties and sixties, the formula was a resounding success. With headlines like “*Mom Boiled Her Baby and Ate Her*{: .small}” and photographs of purported freaks of nature, such as two-headed babies, circulation soared to more than a million. The _Enquirer_ developed a specialty in photographs of newly dead celebrities, and the paper scored a famous scoop with a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald on the autopsy table. (Dylan Howard found an original of that cover on eBay and displays it in his office.)\n\n\n\nIn the late sixties, Pope moved his operations to Florida, where he had another insight that transformed the magazine. At that point, the _Enquirer_ was sold only through traditional venders, such as newsstands, but Pope pioneered the practice of putting magazines in supermarket checkout lines. This required him to scale back the gore (which was unacceptable to the markets) and amp up the celebrity coverage. The transformation proved a boon to business. So did a television campaign featuring the catchphrase “Enquiring minds want to know.” A cover photograph, in 1977, of Elvis Presley in his casket sold 6.7 million copies, an all-time record. (According to a former editor, the _Enquirer_ had paid Elvis’s cousin Billy Mann eighteen thousand dollars for the image. In the past, the tabloid has paid anywhere from a few hundred dollars to six figures for scoops.) After Pope started printing the _Enquirer_ in color, he used his old black-and-white presses to produce the _Weekly World News_, a compendium of true lunacy, often featuring space aliens, which was also a financial success, with as many as a million readers.\n\n\n\nPope died in 1988, when the _Enquirer’s_ circulation was about four million, and the company fell into limbo. The _Enquirer_ tabloids were eventually sold to Evercore, as a part of the A.M.I. deal, in 1999, and David Pecker became the C.E.O. Meanwhile, competitors were eating into the _Enquirer’s_ circulation. Rupert Murdoch had started the _Star_, and a Canadian publisher named Mike Rosenbloom had launched a series of look-alike tabloids called the _Globe_, the _Examiner_, and the _Sun_. Pecker quickly took steps to crush the competition. He bought the _Star_ and Rosenbloom’s magazines, and closed the _Weekly World News_. He also relocated the operation to Rosenbloom’s old headquarters, in Boca Raton. Kevin Hyson, Pecker’s longtime deputy at A.M.I., told me, “He renovated the entire building, spent five or six million dollars, and the building was beautiful, and it came out great, and it was virtually all done. The cafeteria was just about to open, when we were attacked.”\n\n\n\nIn late September, 2001, Bob Stevens, a sixty-three-year-old photo editor at the _Sun_, fell ill. On October 2nd, he checked into a local hospital and was later given a diagnosis of inhalation anthrax. On Stevens’s desk, in the A.M.I. building, investigators discovered an envelope containing powdered anthrax and addressed to the “photo editor” of the _Sun_. Stevens died on October 5th, becoming the first anthrax fatality in the United States since 1976. In short order, the Centers for Disease Control closed the _Enquirer_ building, and most of the employees never set foot inside it again. The structure was so contaminated that all of its contents were destroyed in 2003; the _Enquirer’s_ archive, including photographs, back issues, and notes, was lost in the process. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F594d5e5ed1d4663a811533a8]|||\n\nLast year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Karen McDougal, a Playboy Playmate, claimed to have had an affair with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Pecker hired McDougal as a columnist and paid her a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the rights to the story, which he never published. “The guy’s a personal friend of mine,” Pecker said. *Photograph by Mark Peterson \u002F Redux for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nDuring the outbreak, Pecker offered to bring in a team of doctors to dispense Cipro, an antibiotic, to hundreds of employees at his own expense. (Only one other employee was exposed to anthrax, and he survived.) Pecker also located alternative offices. “He protected his people,” Hyson said. “And we never missed an issue.” As a former _Enquirer_ staffer, who was generally critical of Pecker, told me, “This was his finest hour.” (No arrests were ever made in the 2001 anthrax attacks, which ultimately killed four people in addition to Stevens. Bruce Ivins, a government scientist who was a leading suspect, committed suicide in 2008.)\n\n\n\nBy the time of the anthrax attack, the market for tabloids was shrinking. Competition from the Internet, the decline of print, and the growth of gossip shows on cable television had combined to cut into circulation numbers. Still, there was a core market for Pecker’s products, and he raised prices for his remaining customers. The _Enquirer_ cost a dollar and forty-nine cents when Pecker bought it; the current price is four dollars and ninety-nine cents. He also targeted his tabloids to specific age groups. _OK!_ and _US Weekly_, the newest A.M.I. magazine, have the youngest and most affluent readers, most of whom are in their late thirties and forties and gravitate toward Hollywood gossip. The _Enquirer_ appeals to people in their fifties, who like investigations. The _Globe_ is pitched to buyers in their sixties, who are fascinated by the British Royal Family and loathe Hillary Clinton. According to Pecker, “They love to read the worst possible, horrible things you could read about Hillary.” (A recent _Globe_ headline asserted, “*Hillary: The Real Russian Spy*{: .small}! . . . *New Treason Indictment*{: .small}!”) The oldest audience buys the _Examiner_, whose readers, remarkably, average eighty years old. “They have the lowest income,” Dylan Howard told me. “We do a lot of giveaways for them, and stories about ‘The Golden Girls.’ ” As Pecker said to me, “The people that pay those five dollars, we get a spike the week that they get their Social Security checks. And then they pay us down from there, and then it spikes again. So they actually budget for it.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nPecker and I had lunch in May, just after Tiger Woods was arrested for driving under the influence, and the occasion evoked some wistfulness about the difficulty of publishing a weekly magazine in a world that operates at the pace of the Internet. “That jail photo—we would have had that first,” Pecker told me, referring to Woods’s mug shot. “We would have shown the ‘before’ and ‘after’ on the cover of the _Enquirer_.” Instead, Woods’s booking photo hit the Internet well before the tabloid could run it in the magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker’s relationship with Woods suggests how he’s leveraged his brands even in a declining market. In 2007, the magazine’s tip line received a call claiming that Woods was having trysts with a waitress named Mindy Lawton, who worked at a diner near his home in Orlando. The tipster was Lawton’s mother. As Pecker recalled, “She said her daughter serves him, and then she has a relationship with Tiger, and she goes out to the parking lot behind there and they have sex together.”\n\n\n\nAfter talking to Lawton’s mother, _Enquirer_ reporters staked out the parking lot by the diner, and they saw Woods and Lawton together. “What happened was, Tiger gets into the S.U.V., she came out of the restaurant,” Pecker told me. “The _Enquirer_ guys were behind the bushes and she must have had her period, so she threw the tampon and they grabbed it.” After the obligatory comment call to Woods, Pecker received a phone call from Mark Steinberg, Woods’s agent.\n\n\n\n_Men’s Fitness_ had asked Woods to appear on its cover several times, but he had always declined. A negotiation ensued, whereby Woods would pose for the magazine’s cover in return for a cancelled story in the _Enquirer_ about the diner tryst. Neal Boulton, the editor of _Men’s Fitness_ at the time, recalled, “Pecker was all over me about the negotiations with Tiger’s people.” Boulton quit before the Woods cover was published. “I allowed myself to get sucked into this situation,” he told me. “I just felt pretty lousy about it all.” (Lawton, Steinberg, and Woods declined to comment; Lawton’s mother could not be reached for comment.) \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5d985744755ba41e85]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker didn’t see the negotiation as blackmail. “I was never going to run any of it, because I’d be thrown out of Walmart tomorrow,” he said, referring to the parking-lot encounter’s unsavory details. Twenty-three per cent of the _Enquirer’s_ sales come from Walmart, and the next biggest outlet is the Kroger supermarket chain, at ten per cent; chain stores account for roughly three-quarters of total sales. There are no formal rules for the level of explicitness or vulgarity that the chains will tolerate, but Pecker is careful not to push the limits. In the end, he scored dual victories with Woods: the golfer posed for the cover of _Men’s Fitness_, and later the affair appeared in the skybox of the _Enquirer_. Woods’s marriage and career dissolved not long afterward.\n\n\n\nSteinberg’s attempt to negotiate with the _Enquirer_ was unusual. For celebrities in the tabloid’s gaze, there are often only two options. Marty Singer, a Beverly Hills attorney who represents many subjects of _Enquirer_ stories, told me that the publication will back down in the face of contrary evidence. “You can’t just tell them that a story is wrong,” Singer said. “But, if you present actual evidence that it’s wrong, they usually will respond appropriately.” (Libel suits against the _Enquirer_ are rare these days, though in 2014 the magazine settled a case filed by a friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, apologizing for a false story in connection with the actor’s death and agreeing to fund an annual playwriting award in his name. Richard Simmons, the fitness guru, recently sued the _Enquirer_ for libel based on stories alleging that he had disappeared from public view because he was transitioning into a woman; the case is pending.)\n\n\n\nThe other approach is a fatalistic withdrawal from the _Enquirer_ ecosystem. “If the story is just in the tabloids, we tend to ignore it,” Jon Liebman, the chief executive of Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a leading talent-management firm in Hollywood, whose clients include Brad Pitt, said. “If you engage in tabloid culture, it will never stop, because the tabloid culture feeds on the conversation. If you respond, they just turn your response into a story. But if the fire jumps the road, and a story gets into the mainstream press, then we deal with it.” Politicians almost never engage.\n\n\n\nFor Pecker, the Tiger Woods story encapsulates the grim ethos of _Enquirer_ readers. “Do they care about Tiger Woods? No,” Pecker said. “Do they play golf? No. But do they want to read about his indiscretions? Yes. Do they want to read that someone who is that successful is now failing? Yes. These are people that live their life failing, so they want to read negative things about people who have gone up and then come down.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter Pecker acquired A.M.I., his friendship with Trump deepened. Pecker joined Mar-a-Lago in 2003 and attended Donald’s marriage to Melania there in 2005. When Pecker gave a speech at Pace, his alma mater, Trump introduced him. The _Enquirer_ held its ninetieth-birthday celebration at the Trump SoHo Hotel. Pecker was also invited to a lavish wedding that Trump organized for his ex-wife Ivana, in 2008. “Donald threw this unbelievable party for her at Mar-a-Lago—maybe seven or eight hundred people,” Pecker told me. (Ivana’s marriage, to Rossano Rubicondi, an Italian model and actor more than twenty years her junior, ended in less than a year.) Pecker hired Ivana to write an advice column for the _Globe_, but later replaced her with Debbie Reynolds. When Pecker got to know Jared Kushner, the pair bonded over their interest in the media and considered doing business together. (Jared has owned the New York _Observer_, which was once a weekly, since 2006.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has a great affection for venerable media institutions like the _Enquirer_, according to a longtime associate: “Donald came up in the seventies and eighties, and he still loves the iconic brands, and the _National Enquirer_ was an institution in those days. It reached millions of people. Even though it’s smaller now, Donald’s mind-set is that it’s an influential publication. And he reaches out to those readers when no one else will.” Trump’s personal relationship with Pecker facilitated that outreach. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5ed1d4663a811533a9]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nA former _Enquirer_ employee told me that Pecker would frequently fly from New York to Palm Beach and back on Trump’s private plane. “David thought Donald walked on water,” the employee said. “Donald treated David like a little puppy. Donald liked being flattered, and David thought Donald was the king. Both have similar management styles, similar attitudes, starting with absolute superiority over anybody else.” In the eighties and early nineties, Trump was something of a fixture in the _Enquirer_, thanks to his multiple marriages. A typical headline from 1990 read “*Trump’s Mistress Cheats on Donald with Tom Cruise*{: .small}.” But, once Pecker took over, critical coverage of Trump vanished. “They have an agreement where David would not write anything that damages Donald,” a senior A.M.I. official from this period told me.\n\n\n\nOne employee said that Trump was also a frequent source for _Enquirer_ stories. “When there was something going on in New York, David would talk with Trump about it. Trump provided David with stories directly,” the employee said. “And, if Donald didn’t want a story to run, it wouldn’t run. You can put that in stone.” Indeed, early in the 2016 campaign Pecker simply turned over the pages of the _Enquirer_ to Trump, allowing the candidate to write columns under his own byline.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBecause of Pecker’s close ties with the President, rumors have circulated that the publisher is in line for an ambassadorship. Pecker denies any interest in such a post. Dave Zinczenko, who oversaw several of Pecker’s fitness magazines, told me, “We were having lunch around the time the ambassador story first circulated. He laughed about it. He said that Germany or the U.K. would be too much work. It’s clear he doesn’t want to be an ambassador. It would take him out of the game.” (Pecker said that he would welcome an appointment to the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, a part-time, unpaid, and honorary post.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything, Pecker may further entrench himself in the media business. In 2013, just before Time, Inc., separated from its longtime parent company, Time Warner, Trump devoted a telling series of tweets to Pecker. “David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of *TIME*{: .small} Magazine—nobody could bring it back like David!” Trump wrote. “@*TIME*{: .small} Magazine should definitely pick David Pecker to run things over there—he’d make it exciting and win awards!” Ron Burkle, a California supermarket magnate and a friend of Pecker’s, recalled, “I know they were considering him to be C.E.O. when _Time_ magazine spun off. He hasn’t had a decent balance sheet for as long as I’ve known him, but he figures out how to make his numbers work and keep his businesses going. But the boards of companies like Time Warner can be very political, and they weren’t going to turn the company over to the guy who runs the _Enquirer_.” At the time, it did seem outlandish that the steward of a supermarket-tabloid empire would wind up as the proprietor of a storied name in American journalism. But the idea of Pecker as the leader of Time, Inc., like that of Trump as the President of the United States, has gone from preposterous to more than possible.\n\n\n\nPecker has proved to be a canny leader in a difficult time for print publications. After the recession in 2010, the company reorganized under bankruptcy laws. Evercore sold its original equity stake in 2002, and in the past two decades A.M.I. has had various owners, with a changing cast of board members, but always with Pecker as chief executive. The current board includes David Hughes, who spent many years as a senior executive in Trump’s casino business. At A.M.I. board meetings, which are often held at Mar-a-Lago, Pecker boasts of his relentless cost-cutting at the magazines. (Dylan Howard told me that Pecker reduced editorial expenses by fifty-two per cent over four years, while producing the same number of magazines.) Pecker has a handsome salary, but not one that places him in the top ranks of media entrepreneurs. According to S.E.C. filings, A.M.I. paid Pecker $3.1 million last year. The over-all decline in the marketplace, notwithstanding, Pecker persuaded the board to put up a hundred million dollars to buy _US Weekly_ from Wenner. The _US Weekly_ staff, much reduced by layoffs, now works alongside the tabloid employees in the Manhattan newsroom. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F594d5e5de12ccd77a1625e93]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker remains interested in running Time, Inc., with its stable of weeklies, including _Time_, _Sports Illustrated_, and the great prize, _People_. For a while, the company was shopping itself to potential buyers, and though it’s not officially on the market, these sorts of auctions generally end, sooner or later, with a sale. A.M.I. faces many of the same financial challenges as Time, Inc., and an adviser to Pecker describes the prospect of a merger between them as “two drunks trying to hold each other up.” But both companies own some of the last weeklies in the country, and a merger would mean efficiencies in printing and distribution. Pecker couldn’t buy Time, Inc., on his own, however. He would need, as with Evercore and A.M.I., a deep-pocketed partner, and he’s looking to find one. “I think that there’s a huge opportunity,” Pecker said.\n\n\n\nAt a time when many print publications have disappeared, the readers and employees of Time, Inc., can expect that Pecker, with his disciplined regimen of cost-cutting, usually in the form of layoffs, would keep the company’s venerable titles alive. But _Time_ and the other magazines would survive, as the _Enquirer_ does, as vehicles for Pecker’s cultivation of his friend, the President. That’s what happened when Pecker bought _US Weekly_, which has heretofore largely been apolitical in its orientation. In one of the early issues of _US Weekly_ under Pecker’s leadership, the magazine ran a fawning cover story about Ivanka Trump. “Balancing her personal ideals with love and loyalty to her father,” the cover said, “the president’s daughter will always fight for what she believes in.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F03\u002Fthe-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c2710c62d10815435","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"David Pecker","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"david-pecker"},{"id":"5c2e1cc141e4c73c088d77e1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National Enquirer","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"national-enquirer"},{"id":"5c2e1e1b81ab3335f580f321","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tabloids","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tabloids"},{"id":"5c2e1c842396212cbb9fc9a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Journalism","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"journalism"}],"sections":[{"id":"591bafaa64942807b0a6072b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Publishing World","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-publishing-world"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02be019dfc3494ea4162","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jeffrey Toobin has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1993 and the senior legal analyst for CNN since 2002.

According to dozens of\npages of documents, and seven people directly involved in the effort,\nthe firms that Weinstein hired included Kroll, which is one of the world’s\nlargest corporate-intelligence companies, and Black Cube, an enterprise\nrun largely by former officers of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence\nagencies. Black Cube, which has branches in Tel Aviv, London, and Paris,\noffers its clients the skills of operatives “highly experienced and\ntrained in Israel’s elite military and governmental intelligence units,”\naccording to its literature.\n\nTwo private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met\nwith the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein\nof rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators\npretended to be a women’s-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least\nfour meetings with McGowan. The same operative, using a\ndifferent false identity and implying that she had an allegation against\nWeinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were\ntalking to the press. In other cases, journalists directed by Weinstein\nor the private investigators interviewed women and reported back the\ndetails.\n\nThe explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with Black Cube, signed in July, was\nto stop the publication of the abuse allegations against Weinstein that\neventually emerged in the [New\nYork *Times*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F10\u002F05\u002Fus\u002Fharvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html) and [*The\nNew\nYorker*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Ffrom-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories).\nOver the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies “target,” or\ncollect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological\nprofiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories.\nWeinstein monitored the progress of the investigations personally. He\nalso enlisted former employees from his film enterprises to join in the\neffort, collecting names and placing calls that, according to some\nsources who received them, felt intimidating.\n\nIn some cases, the investigative effort was run through Weinstein’s\nlawyers, including David Boies, a celebrated attorney who represented Al\nGore in the 2000 Presidential-election dispute and argued for marriage\nequality before the U.S. Supreme Court. Boies personally signed the\ncontract directing Black Cube to attempt to uncover information that\nwould stop the publication of a *Times* story about Weinstein’s abuses,\nwhile his firm was also representing the *Times*, including in a libel\ncase.\n\n[#cneembed: script\u002Fvideo\u002F5a0f39d12d1ca05150000005.js?autoplay=0]||||||\n\nBoies confirmed that his firm contracted with and paid two of the\nagencies and that investigators from one of them sent him reports, which\nwere then passed on to Weinstein. He said that he did not select the\nfirms or direct the investigators’ work. He also denied that the work\nregarding the *Times* story represented a conflict of interest. Boies\nsaid that his firm’s involvement with the investigators was a mistake.\n“We should not have been contracting with and paying investigators that\nwe did not select and direct,” he told me. “At the time, it seemed a\nreasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through,\nand that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.”\n\nTechniques like the ones used by the agencies on Weinstein’s behalf are\nalmost always kept secret, and, because such relationships are often run\nthrough law firms, the investigations are theoretically protected by\nattorney-client privilege, which could prevent them from being disclosed\nin court. The documents and sources reveal the tools and tactics\navailable to powerful individuals to suppress negative stories and, in\nsome cases, forestall criminal investigations.\n\nIn a statement, Weinstein’s spokesperson, Sallie Hofmeister, said, “It\nis a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed\nat any time.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn May, 2017, McGowan received an e-mail from a literary agency\nintroducing her to a woman who identified herself as Diana Filip, the\ndeputy head of sustainable and responsible investments at Reuben Capital\nPartners, a London-based wealth-management firm. Filip told McGowan that\nshe was launching an initiative to combat discrimination against women\nin the workplace, and asked McGowan, a vocal women’s-rights advocate, to\nspeak at a gala kickoff event later that year. Filip offered McGowan a fee\nof sixty thousand dollars. “I understand that we have a lot in common,”\nFilip wrote to McGowan before their first meeting, in May, at the\nPeninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. Filip had a U.K. cell-phone number,\nand she spoke with what McGowan took to be a German accent. Over the\nfollowing months, the two women met at least three more times at hotel\nbars in Los Angeles and New York and other locations. “I took her to the\nVenice boardwalk and we had ice cream while we strolled,” McGowan told\nme, adding that Filip was “very kind.” The two talked at length about\nissues relating to women’s empowerment. Filip also repeatedly told\nMcGowan that she wanted to make a significant investment in McGowan’s\nproduction company.\n\nFilip was persistent. In one e-mail, she suggested meeting in Los\nAngeles and then, when McGowan said she would be in New York, Filip said\nshe could meet there just as easily. She also began pressing McGowan for\ninformation. In a conversation in July, McGowan revealed to Filip that\nshe had spoken to me as part of my reporting on Weinstein. A week later,\nI received an e-mail from Filip asking for a meeting and suggesting that\nI join her campaign to end professional discrimination against women. “I\nam very impressed with your work as a male advocate for gender equality,\nand believe that you would make an invaluable addition to our\nactivities,” she wrote, using her wealth-management firm’s e-mail\naddress. Unsure of who she was, I did not respond.\n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F59ea5ceb33b5d65a6f0547d8]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\nFilip continued to meet with McGowan. In one meeting in September, Filip\nwas joined by another Black Cube operative, who used the name Paul and\nclaimed to be a colleague at Reuben Capital Partners. The goal,\naccording to two sources with knowledge of the effort, was to pass McGowan\nto another operative to extract more information. On October 10th, the\nday *The New Yorker* published my story about Weinstein, Filip reached\nout to McGowan in an e-mail. “Hi Love,” she wrote. “How are you feeling?\n. . . Just wanted to tell you how brave I think you are.” She signed off with an “xx.” Filip e-mailed McGowan as recently as October 23rd.\n\nIn fact, “Diana Filip” was an alias for a former officer in the Israeli\nDefense Forces who originally hailed from Eastern Europe and was working\nfor Black Cube, according to three individuals with knowledge of the\nsituation. When I sent McGowan photos of the Black Cube agent, she\nrecognized her instantly. “Oh my God,” she wrote back. “Reuben Capital.\nDiana Filip. No fucking way.”\n\nBen Wallace, a reporter at *New York* who was pursuing a story on\nWeinstein, said that the same woman met with him twice last fall. She\nidentified herself only as Anna and suggested that she had an allegation\nagainst Weinstein. When I presented Wallace with the same photographs of\nBlack Cube’s undercover operative, Wallace recalled her vividly. “That’s\nher,” he said. Like McGowan, Wallace said that the woman had what he\nassumed to be a German accent, as well as a U.K. cell-phone number.\nWallace told me that Anna first contacted him on October 28, 2016, when\nhe had been working on the Weinstein story for about a month and a half.\nAnna declined to disclose who had given her Wallace’s information. Over\nthe course of the two meetings, Wallace grew increasingly suspicious of\nher motives. Anna seemed to be pushing him for information, he recalled,\n“about the status and scope of my inquiry, and about who I might be\ntalking to, without giving me any meaningful help or information.”\nDuring their second meeting, Anna requested that they sit close\ntogether, leading Wallace to suspect that she might be recording the\nexchange. When she recounted her experiences with Weinstein, Wallace\nsaid, “it seemed like soap-opera acting.” Wallace wasn’t the only journalist the woman contacted. In addition to\nher e-mails to me, Filip also e-mailed Jodi Kantor, of the *Times*,\naccording to sources involved in the effort. \n\nThe U.K. cell-phone numbers that Filip provided to Wallace and McGowan\nhave been disconnected. Calls to Reuben Capital Partners’ number in\nLondon went unanswered. As recently as Friday, the firm had a bare-bones\nWeb site, with stock photos and generic text passages about asset\nmanagement and an initiative called Women in Focus. The site, which has\nnow been taken down, listed an address near Piccadilly Circus, operated\nby a company specializing in shared office space. That company said that\nit had never heard of Reuben Capital Partners. Two sources with\nknowledge of Weinstein’s work with Black Cube said that the firm creates\nfictional companies to provide cover for its operatives, and that\nFilip’s firm was one of them.\n\nBlack Cube declined to comment on the specifics of any work it did for\nWeinstein. The agency said in a statement, “It is Black Cube’s policy to\nnever discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or\ndeny any speculation made with regard to the company’s work. Black Cube\nsupports the work of many leading law firms around the world, especially\nin the US, gathering evidence for complex legal processes, involving\ncommercial disputes, among them uncovering negative campaigns. . . . It\nshould be highlighted that Black Cube applies high moral standards to\nits work, and operates in full compliance with the law of any\njurisdiction in which it operates—strictly following the guidance and\nlegal opinions provided by leading law firms from around the world.” The contract with the firm also specified that all of its work would be obtained “by legal means and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLast fall, Weinstein began mentioning Black Cube by name in\nconversations with his associates and attorneys. The agency had made a\nname for itself digging up information for companies in Israel, Europe,\nand the U.S. that led to successful legal judgments against business\nrivals. But the firm has also faced legal\nquestions about its employees’ use of fake identities and other tactics.\nLast year, two of its investigators were arrested in Romania on hacking\ncharges. In the end, the company reached an agreement with the Romanian\nauthorities, under which the operatives admitted to hacking and were\nreleased. Two sources familiar with the agency defended its decision to work for Weinstein, saying that they originally believed that the assignment focussed on his business rivals. But even the earliest lists of names that Weinstein provided to Black Cube included actresses and journalists.\n\nOn October 28, 2016, Boies’s law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, wired to\nBlack Cube the first hundred thousand dollars, toward what would\nultimately be a six-hundred-thousand-dollar invoice. (The documents do\nnot make clear how much of the invoice was paid.) The law firm and Black\nCube signed a contract that month and several others later. One, dated\nJuly 11, 2017, and bearing Boies’s signature, states that the project’s\n“primary objectives” are to “provide intelligence which will help the\nClient’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative\narticle in a leading NY newspaper” and to “obtain additional content of\na book which currently being written and includes harmful negative\ninformation on and about the Client,” who is identified as Weinstein in\nmultiple documents. (In one e-mail, a Black Cube executive asks lawyers\nretained by the agency to refer to Weinstein as “the end client” or “Mr.\nX,” noting that referring to him by name “will make him extremely\nangry.”) The article mentioned in the contract was, according to three\nsources, [the\nstory](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F10\u002F05\u002Fus\u002Fharvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?_r=0) that ultimately ran in the *Times* on October 5th. The book was “Brave,”\na memoir by McGowan, scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in\nJanuary. The documents show that, in the end, the agency delivered to Weinstein more than a hundred pages of transcripts and\ndescriptions of the book, based on tens of hours of recorded\nconversations between McGowan and the female private investigator.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F5a00fddbcbb1980903cfb34a]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\nWeinstein’s spokesperson, Hofmeister, called “the assertion that Mr.\nWeinstein secured any portion of a book . . . false and among the many\ninaccuracies and wild conspiracy theories promoted in this article.”\n\nThe July agreement included several “success fees” if Black Cube met its\ngoals. The firm would receive an additional three hundred thousand\ndollars if the agency “provides intelligence which will directly\ncontribute to the efforts to completely stop the Article from being\npublished at all in any shape or form.” Black Cube would also be paid\nfifty thousand dollars if it secured “the other half” of McGowan’s book\n“in readable book and legally admissible format.”\n\nThe contracts also show some of the techniques that Black Cube employs.\nThe agency promised “a dedicated team of expert intelligence officers\nthat will operate in the USA and any other necessary country,” including\na project manager, intelligence analysts, linguists, and “Avatar\nOperators” specifically hired to create fake identities on social media,\nas well as “operations experts with extensive experience in social\nengineering.” The agency also said that it would provide “a full time\nagent by the name of ‘Anna’ (hereinafter ‘the Agent’), who will be based\nin New York and Los Angeles as per the Client’s instructions and who\nwill be available full time to assist the Client and his attorneys for\nthe next four months.” Four sources with knowledge of Weinstein’s work\nwith Black Cube confirmed that this was the same woman who met with\nMcGowan and Wallace.\n\nBlack Cube also agreed to hire “an investigative journalist, as per the\nClient request,” who would be required to conduct ten interviews a month\nfor four months and be paid forty thousand dollars. Black Cube agreed to\n“promptly report to the Client the results of such interviews by the\nJournalist.”\n\nIn January, 2017, a freelance journalist called McGowan and had a\nlengthy conversation with her that he recorded without telling her; he\nsubsequently communicated with Black Cube about the interviews, though\nhe denied he was reporting back to them in a formal capacity. He\ncontacted at least two other women with allegations against Weinstein,\nincluding the actress Annabella Sciorra, who later went public in *The\nNew Yorker* with a rape allegation against Weinstein. Sciorra, whom he\ncalled in August, said that she found the conversation suspicious and\ngot off the phone as quickly as possible. “It struck me as B.S.,” she\ntold me. “And it scared me that Harvey was testing to see if I would\ntalk.” The freelancer also placed calls to Wallace, the *New York* reporter, and to me.\n\nTwo sources close to the effort and several documents show that the same\nfreelancer received contact information for actresses, journalists, and\nbusiness rivals of Weinstein from Black Cube, and that the agency\nultimately passed summaries of those interviews to Weinstein’s lawyers.\nWhen contacted about his role, the freelancer, who spoke on condition of\nanonymity, said that he had been working on his own story about\nWeinstein, using contact information fed to him by Black Cube. The\nfreelancer said that he reached out to other reporters, one of whom used\nmaterial from his interviews, in the hopes of helping to expose\nWeinstein. He denied that he was paid by Black Cube or Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein also enlisted other journalists to uncover information that he\ncould use to undermine women with allegations. A December, 2016, e-mail\nexchange between Weinstein and Dylan Howard, the chief content officer\nof American Media Inc., which publishes the *National Enquirer*, shows that\nHoward shared with Weinstein material obtained by one of his reporters,\nas part of an effort to help Weinstein disprove McGowan’s allegation of\nrape. In one e-mail, Howard sent Weinstein a list of contacts. “Let’s\ndiscuss next steps on each,” he wrote. After Weinstein thanked him,\nHoward described a call that one of his reporters made to Elizabeth\nAvellan, the ex-wife of the director Robert Rodriguez, whom Rodriguez\nleft to have a relationship with McGowan.\n\nAvellan told me that she remembered the interview. Howard’s reporter\n“kept calling and calling and calling,” she said, and also contacted\nothers close to her. Avellan finally called back, because “I was afraid\npeople might start calling my kids.” In a long phone call, the reporter\npressed her for unflattering statements about McGowan. She insisted that\nthe call be off the record, and the reporter agreed. The reporter\nrecorded the call, and subsequently passed the audio to Howard.\n\nIn subsequent e-mails to Weinstein, Howard said, “I have something\nAMAZING . . . eventually she laid into Rose pretty hard.” Weinstein\nreplied, “This is the killer. Especially if my fingerprints r not on\nthis.” Howard then reassured Weinstein, “They are not. And the\nconversation . . . is RECORDED.” The next day, Howard added, in another\ne-mail, “Audio file to follow.” (Howard denied sending the audio to\nWeinstein.) Avellan told me that she would not have agreed to coöperate\nin efforts to discredit McGowan. “I don’t want to shame people,” she\nsaid. “I wasn’t interested. Women should stand together.”\n\nIn a statement, Howard said that, in addition to his role as the chief\ncontent officer at American Media Inc., the *National Enquirer’s* publisher, he oversaw a television-production agreement with Weinstein,\nwhich has since been terminated. He said that, at the time of the\ne-mails, “absent a corporate decision to terminate the agreement with\nThe Weinstein Company, I had an obligation to protect AMI’s interests by\nseeking out—but not publishing—truthful information about people who Mr.\nWeinstein insisted were making false claims against him. To the extent I\nprovided ‘off the record’ information to Mr. Weinstein about one of his\naccusers—at a time when Mr. Weinstein was denying any harassment of any\nwoman—it was information which I would never have allowed AMI to publish\non the internet or in its magazines.” Although at least one of Howard’s\nreporters made calls related to Weinstein’s investigations, Howard\ninsisted that he strictly divided his work with Weinstein from his work\nas a journalist. “I always separated those two roles carefully and\ncompletely—and resisted Mr. Weinstein’s repeated efforts to have AMI\ntitles publish favorable stories about him or negative articles about\nhis accusers,” Howard said. An A.M.I. representative noted that, at the\ntime, Weinstein insisted that the encounter was consensual, and that the\nallegations were untrue.\n\nHofmeister, Weinstein’s spokesperson, added, “In regard to Mr. Howard,\nhe has served as the point person for American Media’s long-standing\nbusiness relationship with The Weinstein Company. Earlier this year, Mr.\nWeinstein gave Mr. Howard a news tip that Mr. Howard agreed might make a\ngood story. Mr. Howard pursued the tip and followed up with Mr.\nWeinstein as a courtesy, but declined to publish any story.”\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWeinstein’s relationship with Kroll, one of the other agencies he\ncontracted with, dates back years. After Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an\nItalian model, accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her, in 2015,\nshe reached a settlement with Weinstein that required her to surrender\nall her personal devices to Kroll, so that they could be wiped of\nevidence of a conversation in which Weinstein admitted to groping her. A\n[recording of that\nexchange](http:\u002F\u002Fvideo.newyorker.com\u002Fwatch\u002Fharvey-weinstein-caught-on-tape),\ncaptured during a police sting operation, was released by *The New\nYorker* last month.\n\nDuring the more recent effort to shut down emerging stories, Kroll again\nplayed a central role. E-mails show that Dan Karson, the chairman of\nKroll Americas’ Investigations and Disputes practice, contacted\nWeinstein at his personal e-mail address with information about women\nwith allegations. In one October, 2016, e-mail, Karson sent Weinstein\neleven photographs of McGowan and Weinstein together at different events\nin the years after he allegedly assaulted her. Three hours later,\nWeinstein forwarded Karson’s e-mail to Boies and Weinstein’s\ncriminal-defense attorney, Blair Berk, and told them to “scroll thru\nthe extra ones.” The next morning, Berk replied that one photo, which\nshowed McGowan warmly talking with Weinstein, “is the money shot.”\n\nBerk defended her actions. “Any criminal-defense lawyer worth her salt\nwould investigate unproven allegations to determine if they are\ncredible,” she said. “And it would be dereliction of duty not to conduct\na public-records search for photographs of the accuser embracing the\naccused taken after the time of the alleged assault.”\n\nAnother firm, the Los Angeles-based *PSOPS*{:.small}, and its lead private\ninvestigator, Jack Palladino, as well as another one of its investigators, Sara\nNess, produced detailed profiles of various individuals in the saga,\nsometimes of a personal nature, which included information that could be\nused to undermine their credibility. One report on McGowan that Ness\nsent to Weinstein last December ran for more than a hundred pages and\nfeatured McGowan’s address and other personal information, along with\nsections labelled “Lies\u002FExaggerations\u002FContradictions,” “Hypocrisy,” and\n“Potential Negative Character Wits,” an apparent abbreviation of\n“witnesses.” One subhead read “Past Lovers.” The section included\ndetails of acrimonious breakups, mentioning Avellan, and discussed\nFacebook posts expressing negative sentiments about McGowan. (Palladino\nand Ness did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nOther firms were also involved in assembling such profiles, including\nones that focussed on factors that, in theory, might make women likely\nto speak out against sexual abuse. One of the other firm’s profiles was\nof Rosanna Arquette, an actress who later, in [*The* *New\nYorker*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Ffrom-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories),\naccused Weinstein of sexual harassment. The file mentions Arquette’s\nfriendship with McGowan, social-media posts about sexual abuse, and the\nfact that a family member had gone public with an allegation that she\nhad been molested as a child.\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nAll of the security firms that Weinstein hired were also involved in \ntrying to ferret out reporters’ sources and probe their backgrounds.\nWallace, the reporter for *New York*, said that he was suspicious when\nhe received the call from the Black Cube operative using the pseudonym Anna,\nbecause Weinstein had already requested a meeting with Wallace; Adam\nMoss, the editor-in-chief of *New York*; David Boies; and a representative\nfrom Kroll. The intention, Wallace assumed, was to “come in with\ndossiers slagging various women and me.” Moss declined the meeting.\n\nIn a series of e-mails sent in the weeks before Wallace received the\ncall from Anna, Dan Karson, of Kroll, sent Weinstein preliminary\nbackground information on Wallace and Moss. “No adverse information\nabout Adam Moss so far (no libel\u002Fdefamation cases, no court records or\njudgments\u002Fliens\u002FUCC, etc.),” Karson wrote in one e-mail. Two months\nlater, Palladino, the *PSOPS*{:.small} investigator, sent Weinstein a detailed\nprofile of Moss. It stated, “Our research did not yield any promising\navenues for the personal impeachment of Moss.”\n\nSimilar e-mail exchanges occurred regarding Wallace. Kroll sent\nWeinstein a list of public criticisms of Wallace’s previous reporting\nand a detailed description of a U.K. libel suit filed in response to a\nbook he wrote, in 2008, about the rare-wine market. *PSOPS*{:.small} also profiled\nWallace’s ex-wife, noting that she “might prove relevant to\nconsiderations of our response strategy when Wallace’s article on our\nclient is finally published.”\n\nIn January, 2017, Wallace, Moss, and other editors at *New York* decided\nto shelve the story. Wallace had assembled a detailed list of women with\nallegations, but he lacked on-the-record statements from any victims.\nWallace said that the decision not to run a story was made for\nlegitimate journalistic reasons. Nevertheless, he said, “There was much\nmore static and distraction than I’ve encountered on any other story.” \n\nOther reporters were investigated as well. In April, 2017, Ness, of\n*PSOPS*{:.small}, sent Weinstein an assessment of my own interactions with “persons\nof interest”—a list largely consisting of women with allegations, or\nthose connected to them. Later, *PSOPS*{:.small} submitted a detailed report\nfocussing jointly on me and Jodi Kantor, of the *Times*. Some of the\nobservations in the report are mundane. “Kantor is NOT following Ronan\nFarrow,” it notes, referring to relationships on Twitter. At other\ntimes, the report reflects a detailed effort to uncover\nsources. One individual I interviewed, and another whom Kantor spoke to\nin her separate endeavor, were listed as having reported the details of\nthe conversations back to Weinstein.\n\nFor years, Weinstein had used private security agencies to investigate\nreporters. In the early aughts, as the journalist David Carr, who died\nin 2015, worked on a report on Weinstein for *New York*, Weinstein\nassigned Kroll to dig up unflattering information about him, according\nto a source close to the matter. Carr’s widow, Jill Rooney Carr, told me\nthat her husband believed that he was being surveilled, though he didn’t\nknow by whom. “He thought he was being followed,” she recalled. In one\ndocument, Weinstein’s investigators wrote that Carr had learned of\nMcGowan’s allegation in the course of his reporting. Carr “wrote a\nnumber of critical\u002Funflattering articles about HW over the years,” the\ndocument says, “none of which touched on the topic of women (due to fear\nof HW’s retaliation, according to HW).”\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWeinstein’s relationships with the private investigators were often\nrouted through law firms that represented him. This is designed to place investigative\nmaterials under the aegis of attorney-client privilege, which\ncan prevent the disclosure of communications, even in court. \n\nDavid Boies, who was involved in the relationships with Black Cube and *PSOPS*{:.small},\nwas initially reluctant to speak with *The New Yorker*, out of concern\nthat he might be “misinterpreted either as trying to deny or minimize\nmistakes that were made, or as agreeing with criticisms that I don’t\nagree are valid.”\n\nBut Boies did feel the need to respond to what he considered “fair and\nimportant” questions about his hiring of investigators. He said that he\ndid not consider the contractual provisions directing Black Cube to stop\nthe publication of the *Times* story to be a conflict of interest,\nbecause his firm was also representing the newspaper in a libel suit.\nFrom the beginning, he said, he advised Weinstein “that the story could\nnot be stopped by threats or influence and that the only way the story\ncould be stopped was by convincing the *Times* that there was no rape.”\nBoies told me he never pressured any news outlet. “If evidence could be\nuncovered to convince the *Times* the charges should not be published, I\ndid not believe, and do not believe, that that would be averse to the\n*Times’* interest.”\n\nHe conceded, however, that any efforts to profile and undermine\nreporters, at the *Times* and elsewhere, were problematic. “In general,\nI don’t think it’s appropriate to try to pressure reporters,” he said.\n“If that did happen here, it would not have been appropriate.”\n\nAlthough the agencies paid by his firm focussed on many women with\nallegations, Boies said that he had only been aware of their work\nrelated to McGowan, whose allegations Weinstein denied. “Given what was\nknown at the time, I thought it was entirely appropriate to investigate\nprecisely what he was accused of doing, and to investigate whether there\nwere facts that would rebut those accusations,” he said.\n\nOf his representation of Weinstein in general, he said, “I don’t believe\nformer lawyers should criticize former clients.” But he expressed\nregrets. “Although he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr.\nWeinstein has himself recognized that his contact with women was\nindefensible and incredibly hurtful,” Boies told me. “In retrospect, I\nknew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a\nproblem, and done something about it. I don’t know what, if anything,\nhappened after 2015, but to the extent it did, I think I have some\nresponsibility. I also think that if people had taken action earlier it\nwould have been better for Mr. Weinstein.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWeinstein also drafted individuals around him into his efforts—willingly\nand not. In December, 2016, Weinstein asked the actress Asia Argento,\nwho ultimately went public in *The New Yorker* with her allegation of\nrape against Weinstein, to meet in Italy with his private investigators\nto give testimony on his behalf. Argento, who felt pressure to say yes,\ndeclined after her partner, the chef and television personality Anthony\nBourdain, advised her to avoid the meeting. Another actress, who\ndeclined to be named in this story, said that Weinstein asked her to\nmeet with reporters to extract information about other sources.\n\nWeinstein also enlisted two former employees, Denise Doyle Chambers and\nPamela Lubell, in what turned out to be an effort to identify and call\npeople who might speak to the press about their own, or others’,\nallegations. Weinstein secretly shared the lists they compiled with\nBlack Cube.\n\nHofmeister, speaking on Weinstein’s behalf, said, “Any ‘lists’ that were\nprepared included names of former employees and others who were relevant\nto the research and preparation of a book about Miramax. Former\nemployees conducting interviews for the book reported receiving unwanted\ncontacts from the media.”\n\nDoyle Chambers declined an interview request. But Lubell, a producer who\nworked for Weinstein at Miramax decades ago, told me that she was\nmanipulated into participating. In July, 2017, Lubell visited Weinstein’s offices to pitch him on an app\nthat she was developing. In the middle of the meeting, Weinstein asked\nLubell if they could have a private conversation in his office. Lubell\ntold me that a lawyer working with Weinstein was already there, along\nwith Doyle Chambers. Weinstein asked if Lubell and Doyle Chambers could\nwrite a “fun book on the old times, the heyday, of Miramax.” “Pam,” she\nrecalled him saying, “write down all the employees that you know, and\ncan you get in touch with them?”\n\nA few weeks later, in August, after they had made the list, Weinstein\n“called us back into the office,” Lubell recalled. “And he said, ‘You\nknow what, we’re going to put a hold on the book.’ ” He asked Doyle\nChambers and Lubell to “call some of your friends from the list and see\nif they got calls from the press.” In early September, Weinstein\nsummoned Lubell and Doyle Chambers to his office and asked them to start\nmaking calls to people connected to several actresses. “It got kind of\nintense,” Lubell recalled. “We didn’t know these people, and all of a\nsudden this was something very different from what we signed up for.”\nSeveral of the targeted women said that they felt the calls they\nreceived from Lubell and Doyle Chambers, and from Weinstein himself,\nwere frightening.\n\nLubell told me that hours before the first *Times* story broke, on\nOctober 5th, Weinstein summoned her, Doyle Chambers, and others on his\nteam, including the attorney Lisa Bloom, who has since resigned, to his\noffice. “He was in a panic,” Lubell recalled. “He starts screaming, ‘Get\nso-and-so on the phone.’ ” After the story was published, the team\nscrambled to respond to it. Bloom and others pored over pictures that,\nlike the ones featured in the Kroll e-mails, showed ongoing contact\nbetween Weinstein and women who made allegations. “He was screaming at\nus, ‘Send these to the board members,’ ” Lubell recalled. She e-mailed\nthe photographs to the board ahead of the crisis meeting at which\nWeinstein’s position at his company began unravelling.\n\nSince the allegations against Weinstein became public, Lubell hasn’t\nslept well. She told me that, although she knew that Weinstein “was a\nbully and a cheater,” she “never thought he was a predator.” Lubell has\nwondered if she should have known more, sooner.\n\nAfter a year of concerted effort, Weinstein’s campaign to track and\nsilence his accusers crumbled. Several of the women targeted, however,\nsaid that Weinstein’s use of private security agencies deepened the\nchallenge of speaking out. “It scared me,” Sciorra said, “because I knew\nwhat it meant to be threatened by Harvey. I was in fear of him finding\nme.” McGowan said that the agencies and law firms enabled Weinstein’s\nbehavior. As she was targeted, she felt a growing\nsense of paranoia. “It was like the movie ‘Gaslight,’ ” she told me.\n“Everyone lied to me all the time.” For the past year, she said, “I’ve\nlived inside a mirrored fun house.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f2710c62d10815419","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Harvey Weinstein","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"harvey-weinstein"},{"id":"5c2e1cc42bfcc72cd92d0595","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sexual Assault","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sexual-assault"},{"id":"5c2e1d5d397f5b30646d06eb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sexual Harassment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sexual-harassment"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92710c62d10815483","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Private Investigators","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"private-investigators"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59dcc2c0575c4663a2eeed30","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ronan Farrow is an investigative reporter and a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

It was like sniffing spoiled milk: you didn’t need a sip to know it was bad. Then, in June, the President held the first meeting of his complete Cabinet. It aired live, as Trump’s early campaign rallies had, in full and without commentary, on CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing a striped tie that rhymed with the flag behind him, Trump sat at a massive table, smiling. “Mike?” Trump said, and Vice-President Pence took the cue. “Thank you, Mr. President. It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice-President to a President who is keeping his word to the American people.” As cameras clicked like cicadas, each appointee offered up an homage; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, thanked Trump for the “opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.”\n\n\n\nMany compared the spectacle to something out of North Korea. But it was also a near-replica of a production closer to home. It’s become a wearying, ugly observation, a media truism at once superficial and deep: if “The Apprentice” didn’t get Trump elected, it is surely what made him electable. Over fourteen seasons, the television producer Mark Burnett helped turn the Donald Trump of the late nineties—the disgraced huckster who had trashed Atlantic City; a tabloid pariah to whom no bank would lend—into a titan of industry, nationally admired for being, in his own words, “the highest-quality brand.” And here we were again, at the boardroom table, listening to the compliments to the boss, suspended in that eerie, unstable blend of improvisation and scripting. It was enough to make a television critic nostalgic.\n\n\n\nAs it happens, most episodes of Trump on “The Apprentice” are curiously hard to find: they’re not available to stream or download. Only first-season DVDs are for sale, legally, online—and only used ones. The show is not at the Paley Center for Media’s research library, either. (M-G-M, which owns the rights, declined to comment.) To watch, you’ll need occult methods. But at the Paley you can catch something nearly as illuminating: a video of a panel discussion about the show, from 2004, following its first season. It was filmed the day after “The Apprentice” lost the Emmy for best reality show to “The Amazing Race.” The moderator is the “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, who, a year later, played Trump’s wingman in the pussy-grabbing tape.\n\n\n\nTrump, in a dark suit, leans forward in his chair, hands clasped. Mark Burnett, wearing jeans and a shell necklace, lounges next to him. Both are aglow. A year earlier, NBC, whose TV programming was then run by Jeff Zucker, had been in free fall, with the hit sitcom “Friends” about to end and nothing to replace it. Burnett and Trump had provided Zucker with a hat trick: the network’s first strong reality franchise; a solution for its Must-See TV Thursday slot; and a lure for ads from corporations like Pepsi and Microsoft.\n\n\n\nBush asks surprisingly tough questions: he wonders whether Burnett softened Trump with an image “makeover”; he talks about whether reality television is a fad, and whether it’s cruel; and he asks what it felt like to lose the Emmy. As the drip of praise slows, Trump shows flashes of sourness, griping about old enemies, like the host of “The View”—“this fat slob Joy Behar who can’t stand me.”\n\n\n\nBurnett never wavers. A brilliant entrepreneur, and one of the most powerful men in television, he had produced “Survivor,” on CBS, which exploded the economics and aesthetics of television, launching a transformative new genre. “The Apprentice” was the savvy workplace variation that he pitched to Trump in 2002. And yet Burnett presents himself, whether humbly or cannily, as Trump’s acolyte: Robin to Trump’s Batman, he insists.\n\n\n\nThen he casts Trump in a fresh light, years before the 2016 campaign. Trump, Burnett explains, struck him as “a real American maverick tycoon.” Donald “will say whatever he wants.” He “takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. He’s like the guys who built the West. America is the one country that supports the entire world—because of guys like Donald, who create jobs and a tax base that can support the entire planet.” That’s what “The Apprentice” means to him, the producer concludes, with a grin: it’s “a love letter from me to America, and to New York City, because we chose New York City, about what makes America great.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn a 1981 segment of “Rona Barrett Looks at Today’s Super Rich,” the gossip columnist asks the thirty-four-year-old Trump if he’d consider a run for President. Trump laments that television has ruined politics, to the extent that Abraham Lincoln could no longer get elected: “He was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all.” He skirts questions about his political pull, his controversial tax abatements. With his cold eyes, baby cheeks, and rosebud mouth, he resembles James Spader—silky and guarded, a Master of the Universe in a boxy brown suit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the eighties, as Trump built Trump Tower, then the Javits Center, helping to make Manhattan into a luxury playground, he played himself on television. He was omnipresent in pop culture, often as a punch line. He was the “short-fingered vulgarian” of _Spy_ and the inspiration for the bully-villain of “Back to the Future Part II.” But on TV he had swagger: in 1985, he feuded with Mayor Ed Koch on “60 Minutes”; he was a sharp-dressed landlord on the Judith Krantz miniseries “I’ll Take Manhattan”; he appeared briefly in a 1983 “This Old House” episode about Trump Tower. There were numerous appearances on David Letterman, and the time when he asked Larry King, “Do you mind if I sit back a little bit, because your breath is very bad. . . . Has this ever been told to you before?” (King laughed, shocked, and then analyzed Trump’s neg: “That’s how you get the edge.”)\n\n\n\nEarly on, Trump had greater self-control than he had as a candidate, but he couldn’t quite crack the likability factor—and, maybe, he didn’t want to. Long before Tony Soprano launched the anti-hero drama, Trump was _that guy._ He was a handsome go-getter, but also an arrogant self-promoter, proud of his toughness, a flirt with a fat wallet. On “60 Minutes,” he complains about media coverage. “I believe they like to make me out as somebody a little more sinister than I really am,” he tells Mike Wallace. “I don’t look at myself, necessarily, as being sinister.”\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Trump appeared on a game show called “Trump Card,” set at Trump’s Castle, in Atlantic City. As his life became unstable, rocked by divorces and bankruptcies, his TV persona stayed flush. He made cameos on sitcoms: on a 1994 episode of “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” (Carlton faints in admiration); on a 1996 episode of “The Nanny” (he dates Fran). In 1999, he ruined a perfectly good episode of “Sex and the City.” In these incarnations, Trump is a Manhattan fixture. And yet it feels as though he’s shrunk to a fun-size Trump: red tie, yellow hair, “the Donald.” He’s less an icon than he is a retro cartoon.\n\n\n\nBy the turn of this century, in the eyes of New Yorkers, all that remained of the once powerful developer was his logo. This was when he began to reinvent himself as a star in new genres: reality television, pro wrestling, and cable news, particularly Fox News. These combative art forms suited his style—flamboyant and vaudevillian. When Trump first entered TV, the entire medium had been dismissed as junk. Now, even as critics were swooning over the artistry of cable drama, Trump swerved deeper, into stranger regions, straight into the types of television that nobody took seriously, the ones dismissed as guilty pleasures.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhen Burnett pitched Trump to NBC, it was as the host of only the first season of “The Apprentice”; after him, new tycoons, including Mark Cuban and Martha Stewart, were supposed to step in. According to the book “Trump Revealed” (2016), by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the plan quickly changed. Trump’s comfort on camera, his ability to improvise—including the “You’re fired!” tagline—cemented his value, as did the strong first-season ratings. Burnett conceived of the show as “Survivor” in the “urban jungle,” and it became NBC’s flagship. Trump’s relationship with viewers was transformed: “He was a hero, and he had not been one before,” Jim Dowd, then NBC’s publicity director, told Kranish and Fisher.\n\n\n\n\n\nRewatching “The Apprentice” more than a decade later, it’s easy to see why it struck a chord. Glossy and upbeat, the show, which débuted after 9\u002F11 but before the economic collapse, introduced itself as a stirring advertisement for Wall Street as a meritocracy. Each episode opens with the earworm “For the Love of Money,” by the O’Jays, with its “moneymoneymoneymoney” groove: “Talk about cash money! \u002F Dollar bills, y’all . . . For that _lean lean lean mean green_ \u002F Almighty dollar.” The credits feature a dazzling, supersaturated montage of Manhattan, studded with Trump logos, along with cabs, clocks, sped-up clouds. The names of contestants glide by, in neon, formatted as Wall Street tickers. In the voice-over that begins the pilot, Trump recasts his failures as triumphs: “I fought back and won—big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills.” Now he will teach us to do the same.\n\n\n\nThe show’s early contestants were bona-fide strivers, with business backgrounds, not show-biz wannabes. In Season 1, there’s a nerd, Sam Solovey, who moons over Trump like a stalker; and there’s the villainous, dishonest Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, who became a breakout star (and, once Trump was elected, assistant to the President in the White House). But the contest narrows to a white Loyola graduate named Bill Rancic and an African-American Harvard M.B.A., Kwame Jackson. As Joshua Green points out, in his book, “Devil’s Bargain,” “The Apprentice” attracted an unusually high percentage of black and Latino viewers, in part because it highlighted contestants from those groups not as criminals but as entrepreneurs. It also featured contestants from Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern backgrounds, and, in Season 5, recent immigrants. But race is rarely explicitly discussed.\n\n\n\nGender is, all the time. In fact, from a certain angle, the show resembles a “Lean In” feminist boot camp. In this utopian twist on Wall Street, half the players are female, and, initially, all are on the same team. Together, they strategize about how to work with their eccentric male boss and his icy female lieutenant (in later seasons, Trump’s daughter Ivanka). He’s a supportive mentor, but he’s also prone to saying things like “You’re all beautiful women. Do you think you had an advantage over the men, in selling ice cream?”\n\n\n\nThe show’s early “challenges” are sweetly low-key: in the pilot, the players hawk lemonade—no brand names are visible. As with most reality shows, a huge proportion of the series consists of facial expressions—apprehension, disgust, glee—with musical cues, to heighten tiny conflicts. But each episode ends in grandeur, when Trump arrives to pass judgment. First, the losing team deconstructs its failings. Then three candidates grovel before him. Finally, one gets fired, and descends in a golden elevator. These final sequences take place in a boardroom so dimly lit that stripes of shadow pass over the contestants’ faces, as if they were crossing into the underworld. In many ways, “The Apprentice” is a classic reality show of the era, a sleek blend of game show, documentary, and soap opera, spiked with comedy. And yet “The Apprentice” is also “classy,” in Trumpian terms: no one eats bugs or gets too drunk. It’s a fun, upscale fantasy, a voguing competition in executive realness. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F597243a03cdfa859e4ba4e45]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn one way, however, it departs radically from reality: no one criticizes the boss. Instead, the Trump of “The Apprentice” receives endless praise, even behind his back. All scandal and debt are erased; Trump’s combative streak is alchemized into Daddy’s tough love. Celebrities who sign up for reality shows often agree to be made fun of. On “The Apprentice,” while Trump is outrageous, he’s rarely ridiculous: if he insults people, they deserve it (and often love it). He’s a family man and a business genius. Contestants are grateful for his attention, even negative attention, since he could be off doing deals. Frequently, he narrates from a helicopter, hovering like Zeus. Early on, the prizes are tied to Trump’s biography: a visit to his Louis Quatorze apartment (which he describes as being generally reserved for “Presidents and kings”), to meet his then girlfriend, Melania; dinner at the 21 Club, where the winner is seated at the “Fred Trump table.” In the finale, the winner chooses which Trump property to help manage. Often, the winners—who do, in fact, go on to work for Trump, with a salary of $250,000—tell him that they’ve chosen the project that will let them be “closer to you.”\n\n\n\nThe Trump of “The Apprentice” is not a wholly foreign figure. In the second episode, he practically pulls the advertising C.E.O. Donny Deutsch off his feet with a handshake. He rates women’s looks reflexively. He’s also hung up on eugenics, an unspoken contradiction of the show’s meritocratic themes. In one episode, Sam is interrogated in the boardroom. “You don’t believe in the genetic pool? That what you have, you have?” Trump asks Sam. “I’ve got genetic pool big-time, Mr. Trump!” Sam insists, gesticulating. “Just like you got from your father, Fred Trump, and your mother, Mary Trump.”\n\n\n\nTrump determines who has a “lousy personality” and who “is not very well liked”—this comes up most often with women, especially in the show’s final rounds. He can be crude. “This suit is really gross,” he says, dangling a skimpy bathing suit, designed by a black gay contestant. Yet the negativity doesn’t linger. “The Apprentice” is set in a patriotic world of capitalist potential, where the boss takes you in a helicopter to view the Empire State Building (he boasts, deceptively, about his stake in it), and to gaze at the sunset-lit Statue of Liberty, which is, in Trump’s telling, “one of the truly beautiful symbols of anything, anywhere in the world.” In an emotional voice-over, the contestant Adam Israelov speaks about his immigrant father, who arrived with “nothing in his pocket.” “Not bad, Adam,” Trump says. “If you make a lot of money, this”—he gestures at their private aerie—“is the way you’re going to live.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter Season 1, the ratings began to drop. Each year, Trump obsessed over and lied about them, needling reporters who cited them. Even during the 2004 Paley panel, which took place just over a week into the second season, Trump complained that the show’s launch did better because in January “everyone was watching TV,” whereas, in September, “everyone was playing golf.” As cable began its ascent, Trump clung tightly to network values: quality measured only by ad dollars and Nielsen ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe producers began to fiddle with the recipe. The second season stuck with the men against the women; the next tried “street smarts” versus “book smarts.” Then back to a battle of the sexes, then no categories, with the contestants instead advertised as “personally selected by Trump.” He had other ideas: in 2005, _Entertainment Weekly_ reported that he wanted to pit black contestants against white ones. (“Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world,” he explained later.) The sixth season jumped to Los Angeles, where each week’s winning team (the Haves) lived in a mansion and the losers (the Have-nots) in a “tent city.” Each year, the challenges got less creative; often, contestants were simply deputized to promote a sponsor. Trump seemed crankier and nastier. He more frequently called people “losers,” “quitters,” “pathetic.”\n\n\n\nIn 2007, NBC dropped “The Apprentice” from its fall schedule. In what felt like a preëmptive strike, Trump announced new reality-TV projects, without Burnett. There was “Pageant Place,” for MTV, about an apartment full of beauty queens. And there was “Lady or a Tramp,” a Fox series in which “rude and crude” party girls were sent to finishing school—a concept that, over two years, morphed into the Britishized show “The Girls of Hedsor Hall.” The host was Tara Conner, a former Miss USA, to whom Trump had given a second chance after she broke pageant rules. The comedian Rosie O’Donnell accused him of hypocrisy—who was the womanizing Trump to judge? During a press conference for the show, in 2009, Trump spun the incident into a crass rant, speculating about O’Donnell’s motivations: “Tara, I hate to tell you this, for reasons you don’t want to know about, but Rosie would have given you a _second_, _third_, and _fourth_ chance, O.K.? And she would’ve loved every minute of it.” Neither series lasted more than a season.\n\n\n\nThis lurid display was a striking break from “The Apprentice.” But Trump was also embracing yet another role, one that let him play out his most aggressive and debasing impulses: a spot in the pro-wrestling ring, an industry he’d supported since 1988, when he sponsored the W.W.E. event WrestleMania.\n\n\n\nThe first W.W.E. Trump-based story was a bout between wrestlers dressed up as “Trump” and “Rosie,” a one-time experiment that flopped with fans. Then, the spring that “The Apprentice” vanished from NBC, Trump himself entered the ring as a W.W.E. character—a preening, crudely macho version of his role on “The Apprentice.” In the story, “Mr. Trump” arrives to vanquish his former friend Vince McMahon, the insecure tyrant who owns the W.W.E. Trump is introduced as an Oz-like face on a giant screen, as “For the Love of Money” plays and dollar bills tumble from the rafters. (McMahon’s money, not Trump’s.) Their showdown is more of a bro-down: Trump brags that his “Trump Towers” are bigger than McMahon’s “grapefruits.” The audience might be rooting for Trump, McMahon says, “but ninety-five per cent of them are idiots.” Trump replies, “To me, they look like a very smart group of people.”\n\n\n\nWrestling—even more than reality TV—makes anyone who describes it sound like a lunatic. But the series climax, “Battle of the Billionaires,” is so campily homoerotic, so rife with heat and humiliation, that it’s a critic-proof fever dream. “It’s the hostile takeover of Donald Trump!” announcers shriek, as Trump pounds McMahon. Trump’s “second” in the ring is a near-naked black wrestler named Bobby Lashley. McMahon is represented in the ring by Umaga, a Samoan who grunts and screams. When Trump wins, he shaves McMahon’s head.\n\n\n\nTrump might have forged a different path on television, as a libidinous Barnum. Instead, in 2007, just before the economy crashed, NBC revived his old show as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The reboot was glitzier, more circus-like. The ensemble now comprised C-level celebrities: wrestlers and lesser-known country singers; piggish guys like the rock star Gene Simmons, who bonded with Trump over women; and various others, among them the singer Cyndi Lauper, the athlete Darryl Strawberry, and the disgraced Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Rather than compete for a job, the contestants raised money for charities, often by pestering more famous friends. The professional poker player Annie Duke gives to Refugees International, interviewing an Iraqi translator who had difficulty getting visas for her children; Simmons to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric *AIDS*{: .small} Foundation.\n\n\n\nThe original show had painted the bankrupt Trump as a respected mogul; “The Celebrity Apprentice” made the tightwad a philanthropist. During Season 5, Trump filmed a special boardroom segment with Ignacio, a child beneficiary of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Ignacio, from Milwaukee, had won an essay contest on “Why I’m Proud to Be Bilingual.” His “wish” is to be fired by Trump. Instead, the host praises him and hands him a check.\n\n\n\nFor all the do-gooder icing, the deeper shift was toward more aggressive product integration. As always, Trump touts his hotels and resorts, his water and his ties; and the celebrities do the same for their albums and perfumes. The human brands praise the corporate ones, which benefit by association with the charitable ones. The structure echoes that of the Trump Foundation: each week, money is funnelled to philanthropy under Trump’s name, though none of it is donated by him. Whereas the original “Apprentice” bore some resemblance to Wall Street training, “The Celebrity Apprentice” was sheer shilling: its sponsors paid from five million to nine million dollars for a slot, according to an estimation by _Ad Age_. “There’s never been another show where you’ve had a product sold for two hours,” Trump told the magazine, in 2011. “They do a 30-second commercial, but where do they do two hours?”\n\n\n\nThe value of those products was another matter. In one episode, about identity theft (“a yuge problem,” Trump says), the sponsors are Norton and Lifelock, a subscription online-security service based in Tempe, Arizona. The challenge is to create an advertorial in _Time_. In a particularly delightful moment, Blagojevich worries that they’re misusing the term “bank fraud” in their copy. The episode aired on March 28, 2010. Nineteen days earlier, the F.T.C. had fined Lifelock twelve million dollars for deceptive business practices and for failing to secure sensitive customer data. In 2015, the company was ordered to pay a hundred million dollars after failing to meet security standards.\n\n\n\nIn the third episode of Season 7, “Outside the Box,” the client is Kodak, which also sponsored the season, creating miniature “Kodak moments.” In January, 2007, when the episode aired, Kodak was veering toward collapse, owing to the rise of digital photography. But, on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Kodak appeared to be a gleaming model of vigorous corporate muscle, a company that had “reinvested in digital.”\n\n\n\nThe two contestant teams—Empresario and Hydra—are assigned to create Airstream trailers touting the company’s printer ink. Inspecting the project is a guest judge, Jim Cramer, the investment-plugging host of “Mad Money,” on CNBC. He greets the country-music star Trace Adkins by saying, “How’s business?” Trace drawls back, “Well, you know, I’ve got a stock tip for you, man.” As Cramer smiles encouragingly, Adkins explains that, once he’s “done exposing the world to what the Kodak Easyshare will do,” the stock will be “through the roof.”\n\n\n\nIn the boardroom, Simmons is mocked for talking back to the clients when they reject his slogan, “It’s a Kodak World.” “Talk your way out of this one, big boy!” the British pundit Piers Morgan scoffs. “Mate, you say Kodak’s wrong. Kodak’s the biggest success story in America right now.” In the end, Trump fires Simmons. Two years later, the company posted a hundred-and-thirty-seven-million-dollar loss. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the fifth season of “The Apprentice,” Ivanka Trump chastises a contestant for bearing grudges. Trump cuts her off: “Who doesn’t! I do. Nobody takes things more personally than me. When somebody says something personal about me, I hate them for the rest of my life. It’s probably wrong, but I hate people.” He pauses. “Do you understand that? I hate ’em. . . . I never recover from it.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a villain’s speech—and a glimpse of a darker Trump. In response, everybody laughs. Those are the boardroom rules. The same Trump shows up on the 2004 Paley panel, fuming over his loss at the Emmys, which he argues hurt the credibility of the awards. “The Amazing Race,” he says, “wasn’t a threat, it was nothing,” and then he makes fun of the winner’s speech: “Some guy with a piece of paper, who conceived of this piece of crap.” He also complains, repeatedly, that HBO’s “Angels in America” got too many prizes, a tangent that likely won him points with the ghost of Roy Cohn, if not the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the top Emmy winners were “Arrested Development” and “The Sopranos”—two brilliant series that were, coincidentally, about rich criminal families. For television critics, it was a triumphant year. But Trump had a rougher sense of the medium’s power: he knew that numbers were what counted. He would go on to win an election fuelled by class rage and racial fury; but he also won because he’d starred in a show in which high-school-educated small-town white men cheerfully vied with big-city black female lawyers. If you can have it both ways, you can have everything.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, NBC fired Trump. By that time, he’d been an Obama-baiting birther for four years, but his comments about Mexican rapists went too far. He’d alienated black and Latino viewers. For others, the spell was cast: many of his biggest fans would continue to see him through the filter of Burnett’s TV hit, no matter what Trump said or did. By 2017, the media was his enemy. That included his old friend Jeff Zucker, who was now the president of CNN. One day, the President tweeted old footage from “The Battle of the Billionaires,” repurposed as a bizarre meme. A CNN logo was superimposed on McMahon’s head as Trump pummelled him.\n\n\n\nTrump was a different sort of TV celebrity now. But if he’d wanted to conquer the medium, things had not worked out. Trump kept producing his own reality stunts as President: in a press conference, he gestured grandly at piles of folders, props that he claimed were filled with financial disclosures; he theatrically whipped up suspense over the competition between two Supreme Court nominees. And yet he couldn’t control how these stunts played on TV—other people would have the final edit. Day and night, he watched for hours, searching for people to hate. They were easy to find. If you squinted a bit, the President might look like just another old man, yelling at the screen. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2017\u002F07\u002F31\u002Fthe-tv-that-created-donald-trump","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1e19b75f002c8941e634","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“The Apprentice”","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-apprentice"},{"id":"5c2e1c997e716b454591add2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidents","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidents"},{"id":"5c2e1e1936cecf4019214392","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donaldtrump"}],"sections":[{"id":"591baef1349d4f46aa0520ac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"American Chronicles","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"american-chronicles"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ff6bc14b3c606c109ec7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Emily Nussbaum won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2016.
