By a vote of 245-182, the Democratic-led House just approved a resolution terminating President Trump’s national emergency at the border with Mexico and blocking his reprogramming of federal funds for wall construction.
The resolution will now head to the Senate, where it must be voted on within 18 days — though Senate Republican leaders are in no rush.
Trump remains extremely popular in most GOP held states.”On Tuesday, the White House also issued an official threat to veto the resolution.
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), the lead House sponsor of the resolution, acknowledged that it’s unlikely lawmakers will have enough votes to override a Trump veto.
“Look, the president is probably going to veto this bill, and it’s an uphill climb to override any veto, not just this one,” he told reporters, according to The Washington Post.
