Omar’s controversial first months pay off big in donation dollarsAnti-Semitism charges aren’t the only thing that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has racked up during her tumultuous first few months in Washington.
According to analysis of Federal Election Commission filings detailed at Politico, the controversial freshman lawmaker has raised over $832,000 during the first quarter of this year.
About half of that is from donations under $200 and the majority of it came via online donations from ActBlue – a wildly successful online fundraising portal for leftist candidates and causes.
Needless to say, for a freshman to become one of House Democrats’ top fundraisers in her first quarter is no small feat.
However, most House freshmen also don’t spend their first few months getting as much national attention for controversial statements like Omar has.
