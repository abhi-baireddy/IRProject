Omar’s controversial first months pay off big in donation dollars

Anti-Semitism charges aren’t the only thing that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has racked up during her tumultuous first few months in Washington. She’s also been pulling in big piles of cash.

According to analysis of Federal Election Commission filings detailed at Politico, the controversial freshman lawmaker has raised over $832,000 during the first quarter of this year. About half of that is from donations under $200 and the majority of it came via online donations from ActBlue – a wildly successful online fundraising portal for leftist candidates and causes.

Several people also gave maximum donations under federal law.

Needless to say, for a freshman to become one of House Democrats’ top fundraisers in her first quarter is no small feat. However, most House freshmen also don’t spend their first few months getting as much national attention for controversial statements like Omar has.

Since being sworn in back in January, the Minnesota representative has tweeted an anti-Semitic trope about Jewish money, promoted a different anti-Semitic trope about dual loyalty, pushed for the release of a jailed Muslim Brotherhood leader, defended an older anti-Semitic tweet, avoided being the person named reason behind a House anti-hate resolution, and minimized 9/11 while flirting with a conspiracy theory about the attacks.

Seems like controversy is a pretty lucrative game.
