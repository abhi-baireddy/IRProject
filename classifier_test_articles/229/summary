A zookeeper in Jacksonville, Florida, was taken to the hospital after she was struck by a rhino horn Tuesday.
According to CBS affiliate WJAX-TV, officials at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens said the female zookeeper came into contact with Archie, a 50-year-old male southern white rhino, during a routine training session.
The zoo's executive director, Tony Vecchio, said he does not know the zookeeper's condition, but said she was alert and talking with EMTs.
This is Archie, the 50-year-old Southern white rhino the #Jacksonville Zoo says injured a zookeeper with his horn this morning.
In October, WJAX reported another zookeeper at the Jacksonville zoo was shocked by an electric fence.
