At the center of the economic nationalism that underpins President Donald Trump's trade agenda, there's a seemingly unsolvable agriculture problem: America grows more food than it eats.
In 2017, the last full year before the start of Trump's trade war, America exported $133 billion worth of food, beverage, and animal feed products, according to data from the federal Department of Commerce.
And when China cut off purchases of American agricultural goods, it was American farmers who paid the biggest price.
The Trump administration's newest trade negotiating tactic is to ask China to put tariffs on American manufactured goods—the very sector Trump's trade war was supposed to be helping—in order to relieve the pain the trade war caused for American farmers.
Like before, American farmers will export goods to China, and then will use the money they earn to buy other things—because that's how trade works—and often those other things will be made in China.
