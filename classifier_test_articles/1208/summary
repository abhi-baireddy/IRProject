Trump is pretending that video of a fence being repaired from 5 months ago is evidence of his "wall" being built right now.
Trump posted video of the fence repair with the caption, "We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico.
"It's a replacement project," Mike Petersen, a public affairs director for the Army Corps of Engineers, told Task & Purpose.
The footage is from the Santa Theresa Project Border Wall Replacement Project, which is an effort to upgrade an existing 20-mile stretch of pre-existing vehicle barriers.
There's no wall being built, no wall to be finished, and no wall "under construction."
