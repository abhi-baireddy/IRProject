Speaking to reporters at the White House Tuesday evening, President Trump announced a freeze on U.S. funding for the World Health Organization.
During the lengthy fight against Wuhan coronavirus, the organization has repeatedly published false information about the disease.
The World Health Organization has been lying on China's behalf for months and the consequences have been lethal.
WHO leadership also criticized President Trump for shutting down travel to and from China in late January.
