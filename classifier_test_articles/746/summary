Wendy Williams’ husband is owning up to his mistakes.
Five days after the National ENQUIRER confirmed that the 54-year-old talk show host had filed for divorce from Kevin Hunter, her husband of 21 years, he’s begging for forgiveness.
“Twenty-eight years ago, I met an amazing woman: Wendy Williams.
She said her life has become a living hell,” a source told the ENQUIRER before the entertainer filed to officially split.
“The things that Kevin’s done to Wendy have left her a physical wreck and her reputation in tatters.”Prior to filing for divorce, Williams had taken a two-month break from The Wendy Williams Show, then revealed on the March 19 episode that she had been living in a sober house.
