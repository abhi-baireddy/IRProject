Acting on behalf of 152 inmates, the rapper and mogul argues prisoners’ constitutional rights are being violatedJay-Z has filed a civil lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections on behalf of 152 inmates at a state prison, alleging “barbaric” conditions.
The suit calls for the Department of Corrections to eliminate health and safety risks within 90 days.
The department wouldn’t comment on the suit, but has previously said that violence is gang-related rather than linked to staffing issues.
It is the second lawsuit brought against the prison by Jay-Z, in tandem with fellow rapper Yo Gotti – the pair filed a suit on behalf of 29 other inmates in January.
