A federal judge ruled that Ken Cuccinelli, who previously headed U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), was unlawfully appointed to run the agency.
The judge ruled this title creation did not qualify him for the position.
“Cuccinelli may have the title of Principal Deputy Director, and the Department of Homeland Security’s order of succession may designate the office of the Principal Deputy Director as the first assistant’ to the Director,” he wrote.
Cuccinelli became the deputy secretary of the department in November but is still named as the senior official who runs USCIS.
