Expect even more measles outbreaks in the United States in coming years, public health experts say, thanks to overseas epidemics and growing misinformation efforts by anti-vaccination activists.
Outbreaks of the highly contagious virus are now active in 20 states, with 555 confirmed cases in the US this year alone, according to the CDC.
All of the new US outbreaks originally derived from infections transmitted by travelers — either visitors from overseas, or US residents who went abroad.
And with measles cases now surging outside of the US too — seeing a 300% global increase this year compared to last — we are likely to see more cases here, public health experts say.
Those epidemics are leading to outbreaks even in countries with good overall vaccination rates, such as Israel, Thailand, and the US.
