Every day brings tragic stories of Americans young and old, of all racial backgrounds, dying after rationing their insulin—the result of explosive increases in the costs of the drug.
According to a study by Yale University researchers, 1 in 4 people with diabetes are rationing their prescriptions.
This is not a new phenomenon, but one that is getting worse with the continuing rise in drug costs.
A woman recounted to the New Yorker’s Amanda Schaffer how she and her sister, who both have Type 1 diabetes, have shared and rationed their insulin due to its rising costs.
The costs of older, slow-acting insulins may be less, but the possibility of error on the part of patients is much higher.
