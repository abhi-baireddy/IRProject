But on Presidents Day, he finally won something fair and square: the title of worst president ever.
According to the "Presidential Greatness Survey" published Monday by the American Political Science Association, Trump is ranked 44th out of 44 presidents.
The survey counts President Grover Cleveland's non-consecutive administrations as a single presidency, thus sparing Trump from being ranked one spot lower.
The survey also ranked President Obama 8th overall, making him the the greatest living president, one spot ahead of Ronald Reagan.
By contrast, President Obama's first appearance in this survey in 2014 placed him at 18th, and a group of 238 presidential historians ranked Obama 15th after his first year in office.
