The Russia investigation may be drawing to a close.
But it’s more likely that President Trump’s effort to hinder the Russia investigation simply worked—specifically, his implicit promise to pardon allies in exchange for their silence.
Mueller scored a major victory in September when the former Trump campaign chairman agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
I noted at the time that Manafort was one of the few Americans who could give a comprehensive account of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.
In November, Mueller told a federal judge that he believed Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to federal prosecutors multiple times.
