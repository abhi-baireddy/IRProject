Pence said Wednesday 432,000 people had been tested, though the numbers did not include private testing facilities.</p><div><aside class="InlineElement InlineImage"><figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image"><div class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></div><div class="Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative"><img class="" alt="" title="" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><figcaption><div class="InlineImage--caption"><div class="InlineImage--source-meta"><img class="Image Logo Logo__xs" alt="Alex Brandon/AP" title="Alex Brandon/AP" data-mptype="image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></div><span class="InlineImage--caption-meta" aria-hidden="true"><div style="overflow:hidden"><span>Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, March 26, 2020, in Washington.</span></div></span><span class="Screen__Reader__Text">Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, March 26, 2020, in Washington.</span><span class="InlineImage--source-title">Alex Brandon/AP</span></div></figcaption></figure></aside></div><p>

Of the 146,000 inmates serving time in federal prison facilities, one-third are considered to have preexisting medical conditions and roughly 10,000 are over the age of 60, Barr said at a news conference on Thursday.
</p><p>
"You want to make sure that our institutions don't become petri dishes and it spreads rapidly through a particular institution. But we have the protocols that are designed to stop it and we are using all the tools we have to protect the inmates," Barr said.
</p><p>
Among those tools "will be identifying vulnerable prisoners who would make more sense to allow to go home to finish their confinement," he said.</p><div><div class="CalloutLink"><div class="CalloutLink-item"><span><svg class="icon__svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#icon__plus"></use></svg></span><a class="AnchorLink CalloutLink-text" tabindex="0" data-track-moduleofclick="Callout" data-track-position="10" data-track-ctatext="MORE-Tracking-the-spread-of-the-novel-coronavirus-in-the-US-and-around-the-world" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-map-tracking-spread-us-world/story?id=69415591">MORE: Tracking the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US and around the world</a></div></div></div><p>
Anyone who would be considered eligible for release to home confinement would have to quarantine for 14 days, he said. 
</p><p>
In a phone interview with ABC News after the news conference, Barr stressed that there would be significant limits on what would make prisoners eligible for release to home confinement, noting that they could not be convicted of violent crimes or sex offenses -- which makes up roughly 40% of the over-60 population.
