Mr. Trump has predicted growth of as much as 5 percent, while his advisers have routinely promoted 3 percent as the new normal.
Growth averaged just over 2 percent from 2010, the first full year after the Great Recession ended, through 2016, when Mr. Trump was elected to the White House.
Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers outlined the projections on Tuesday in the annual Economic Report of the President.
As is customary for all administrations, Mr. Trump’s advisers built their forecasts around the presumption that all of Mr. Trump’s policy proposals would be enacted in the years to come.
Those include making permanent the individual tax cuts from 2017 and the infrastructure package that Mr. Trump occasionally mentions in speeches, but that has never gained serious consideration in Congress.
