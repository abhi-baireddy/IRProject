Congress is petitioning the Education Department to explain how $235,000 in taxpayer dollars were used to fund a series of anti-Israel events organized by Duke University and the University of North Carolina that featured speakers and events tied to Palestinian terror groups.
Holding had received a spate phone calls from citizens concerned about the anti-Semitic events.
Duke has come under fire in past moths for hosting similar events that witnesses have described as anti-Israel.
"According to first-hand accounts, the conference had a radical anti-Israeli bias," Holding wrote in the letter, reporting accounts described by concerned constituents.
"We want to be very clear: antisemitism is one of the great scourges of modern life," read a joint statement from Duke University President Vincent E. Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth.
