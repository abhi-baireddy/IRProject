David Sirota, the pro-Russian journalist, has been hired by Bernie Sanders to assist the independent Senator’s run for President.
But Mr. Sirota has a worse problem than being outed as an unethical PR flack faking being a journalist.
Bernie Sanders has admitted that he knew that Russian bots and trolls – the notorious ‘Bernie Bros’ – were helping him in 2016.
This reporter challenged him on Twitter in what now seems a very one-sided conversation, as Mr. Sirota has deleted all his Russia-related tweets.
Taking the job with Bernie Sanders while pretending to still be a journalist may wind up costing Mr. Sirota more than merely his reputation.
