The tunic of St. Louis, believed to have belonged to King Louis IX, came out of the chest along with fragments of the cross and a nail, said Patrick Chauvet, rector of Notre Dame Cathedral.
The sky above the cathedral flamed orange, and the fire lurched toward Notre Dameâ€™s iconic towers, then slipped inside.
Could Notre Dame itself be saved?
