Abortion rights group asks Supreme Court to strike Louisiana admitting privileges law The justices in February voted to put the Louisiana law on hold.
Abortion rights advocates have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to summarily strike down a controversial Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
The organization is challenging a decision by the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upholding the Louisiana law.
There’s no need for new arguments.”Supporters of the Louisiana law say the admitting-privileges requirement is a reasonable restriction to ensure the health and safety of women seeking abortions.
Kathaleen Pittman, clinic administrator at one Louisiana abortion provider, said health care workers are already seeing an uptick in cases of attempted “self-abortions” because of shrinking options for women.
