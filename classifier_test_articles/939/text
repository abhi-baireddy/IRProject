Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt, Fox News town hall appearance Monday was a smart move on his part and the network's, but the questions and answers came off too "rehearsed" and did not get to the meat of the 2020 presidential race, Bill O'Reilly told Newsmax TV on Tuesday.

"Senator, can you explain to me – because I'm a simple man, not nearly as smart as you are – why the economy today in America under Donald Trump is so successful?" O'Reilly said he would have asked Sen. Sanders, delivering his "Talking Points Memo" on "The Wayne Allyn Root Show."
