“There is no international right to an abortion and these terms should not be used to promote pro-abortion policies and measures,” Azar said.
The statement, suggesting a stance against abortion, was presented during a high-level meeting on universal health coverage.
The meeting aims to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage for everyone around the world, which would include access to health care services, medicines and vaccines.
The effort is part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, under which all countries have committed to try to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.
“We therefore request that the UN, including UN agencies, focus on concrete efforts that enjoy broad consensus among member states," Azar said.
