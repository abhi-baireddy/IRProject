The legislation, which is co-sponsored by Representative David Cicilline, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to garner broad support in the Democratic-controlled House.
Lawmakers believe the Mueller report could be coming soon and are concerned about Justice Department regulations that require Mueller to submit a confidential report and leave the decision about what to disclose to Attorney General William Barr.

It also calls on the Justice Department to release unclassified portions of the document to the public.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell avoided commenting on the Senate bill last month but told reporters that the Mueller report “ought to be as fully open and transparent … as possible.”(Reporting by David Morgan; editing by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis)Published in
