Ever since Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry announced they were stepping back from their “roles” as senior royals, there’s been a debate in British media about whether the coverage of Markle has been racist.
And when confronted with the evidence that shows that certainly hasn’t always been the tone of reporting, they ask: Is it really racism, though?
One poll suggested a significant proportion of people thought it was Markle’s decision, not one made jointly or by Prince Harry.
And since the 1980s, unemployment rates among women of color have been consistently higher than for white women.
The coverage of Meghan Markle and the recent fallout is just another reminder that it certainly is.
