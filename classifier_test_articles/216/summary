There have been nearly 6,000 reports of sexual abuse involving unaccompanied immigrant children while in the custody of the United States government in the last four years, according to documents made public Tuesday.
The allegations include staff members at facilities housing immigrant children touching minors’ genitals, showing children pornography, and kissing them.
The documents show 178 allegations of sexual abuse by staff members on minors and at least 833 allegations of unaccompanied children sexually abusing other children.
At least 19 accusations of sexual abuse of unaccompanied children included adults who did not work at these facilities.
“These HHS documents detail a staggering number of sexual assaults on unaccompanied children in their custody,” said Deutch in a statement.
