68% of all NYC public school students are Black or Latino.
To only have 7 Black students accepted into Stuyvesant (a *public* high school) tells us that this is a system failure.
Didn’t she just say the majority of kids in public schools are Black and Latino?
Do you want more white kids in the school?
If AOC really wants to tackle the issues in public education going the lazy ‘racist system’ route isn’t the answer.
