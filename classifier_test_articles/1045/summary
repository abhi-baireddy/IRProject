WASHINGTON -- Each person living in America now owes a $67,000 portion of the national debt while the debt per taxpayer is more than $142,600.
The latest national debt figures from the Treasury Department show that the national debt has surpassed $22 trillion, which represents more than $67,000 per person.
In 2018, the IRS received 154,444,000 income tax returns, which means the debt per taxpayer currently equals $142,625.
These figures do not include the amount of "unfunded liabilities" or "promised benefits" from Medicare and Social Security.
According to some estimates, unfunded liabilities for Social Security total more than $12.5 trillion over the next 75 years.
