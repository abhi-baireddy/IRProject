WASHINGTON -- Each person living in America now owes a $67,000 portion of the national debt while the debt per taxpayer is more than $142,600.

According to the Census Bureau, there are 328.7 million people living in the United States. The latest national debt figures from the Treasury Department show that the national debt has surpassed $22 trillion, which represents more than $67,000 per person.

In 2018, the IRS received 154,444,000 income tax returns, which means the debt per taxpayer currently equals $142,625.

These figures do not include the amount of "unfunded liabilities" or "promised benefits" from Medicare and Social Security. According to some estimates, unfunded liabilities for Social Security total more than $12.5 trillion over the next 75 years. Medicare's unfunded obligations are currently projected to be $37 trillion over the same time period, according to the latest data.
