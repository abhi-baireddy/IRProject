Democrats brought in a convicted liar to testify before Congress today.
Low and behold, he lied again!
Cohen said he did not want a job in the White House.
Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump both refuted his testimony saying he was lobbying everyone for the Chief of Staff job.
Even CNN had to admit Cohen was lying again about not wanting a job in the White House.
