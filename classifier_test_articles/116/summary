Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that federal aid would soon arrive for communities impacted by historic flooding in the Midwest.
The latest: Pence visited a relief shelter in Omaha, Nebraska, and surveyed flood damage in the region during a tour of the region.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau said farm and ranch losses from the flooding could total $1 billion and there would be up to $500 million in livestock losses, according to the Associated Press.
The big picture: Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa declared states of emergency after melting snow and heavy rain from a "Bomb Cyclone" in the Midwest caused deadly, historic flooding around the Platte and Missouri rivers.
Pete Ricketts said it's the worst flooding in the state for 50 years.
