On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that asked whether that federal law should be struck down for restricting speech that is protected by the First Amendment.
The case is United States v. Sineneng-Smith.
Her lawyer, Mark Fleming, told the justices that the federal law itself should be wiped from the books.
"Normally, in the criminal law," Gorsuch observed, we "don't allow punishment for speech greater than the underlying conduct itself.
A decision in United States v. Sineneng-Smith is expected by June.
