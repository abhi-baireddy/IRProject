While the role of White House communications director has remained vacant since the departure of Hope Hicks in March, new reports have revealed that the president has offered the job to a well-known former Fox News executive – who has accepted the position.

Of course, this isn’t just any Fox News executive. Former co-president of Fox News Bill Shine was ousted from the conservative network in May 2017 after becoming embroiled in the high-profile sexual harassment scandal that had enveloped the outlet.

Shine oversaw the departure of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign after a 20-year career after former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit against him – and ultimately joined by others – who alleged sexual misconduct. He died shortly thereafter. Shine, for his part, remained a staunch defender of the serial abuser.

The move is yet another shameful indication of Fox News’ entrenchment in this administration. A network that once billed itself as “fair and balanced” – a title that it finally shed in a rare glimpse of self-acknowledgment – is not only serving as a mouthpiece for the administration, but staffing it. It’s American state propaganda.

Sadly, the move is not surprising either. Trump adding another unqualified shill whose shameful failure to protect women amid the #MeToo movement is par for the course in a White House that operates more like a C-grade reality show than the respected institution that it once was.
