Boxes of N95 protective masks for use by medical field personnel in New Rochelle, New York, March 17, 2020.
(Mike Segar/Reuters)A federal agency reportedly shipped face masks overseas from a Miami warehouse even as a nearby Veterans Affairs hospital was rationing them due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had a warehouse of face masks sitting unused in Miami while a Veterans Affairs hospital in the city was telling its health care workers to use the same face mask for an entire week, Fox News reported.
Since then, however, the administration has reportedly halted USAID shipments of personal protective equipment out of the country.
The government has also been unable to fill more than 90 percent of the requested number of N95 protective face masks.
