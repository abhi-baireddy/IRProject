Welcome to another episode of “Ocasio-Cortez Doesn’t Get It,” where we delve into the myriad of things New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) runs her mouth about, but doesn’t seem to understand.
Rahm Emanuel suggests that The Bronx and Minneapolis are not "the middle of the country" and that @AOC + @IlhanMN's policies don't represent "the middle" either.

They don’t represent Michigan or Minnesota, they represent blue districts in those states.
