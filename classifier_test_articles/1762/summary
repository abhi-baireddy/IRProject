Bernie Sanders, 77, and Hillary Clinton, 71, are back at it again, squabbling and wrangling over Every.
Bernie, of course, has reason to be sore after his 2016 loss to Hillary in the Democratic Party primaries.
Early on, Team Clinton essentially took over the Democratic National Committee, which then made things very difficult for Mr. Sanders.
Plus, he stayed in the race forever, forcing Mrs. Clinton to spend much needed cash.
So, there no love lost between Bernie and Hillary â€” to be clearer, they pretty much hate each other.
