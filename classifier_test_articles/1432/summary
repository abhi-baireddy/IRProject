Poor Bill de Blasio.
This is probably the only interesting fact about the mayor of New York, but he never gets any credit for it.
In his home state, de Blasio doesn't even win the superlative for being the most craven politician, an honor that belongs to the Democratic governor, Andrew "Amazon" Cuomo.
If a politician gives a speech in an early primary state and no one hears it, did it really happen?
The best way to tell that de Blasio doesn't care about something is if he makes noise about it.
