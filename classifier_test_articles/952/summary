Montgomery County police collared Jovan Crawford, 27, and Scott Duncan Roberson, 25, for allegedly pummeling Togo native Atsu Mable over his Trump cap, according to cops and local media.
“They were asking me, ‘Hey bro, why did you put that hat on?’ And I didn’t say anything, I just passed by,” Mable told WJLA-TV.
They both face charges of robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, assault, and theft, according to officials.
