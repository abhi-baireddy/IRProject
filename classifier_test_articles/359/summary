Trump has reportedly always viewed federal investigators in Manhattan as his biggest threat, since they have jurisdiction over his family business, his now-closed foundation, and even his campaign because it's headquartered at Trump Tower in the city.
And whatever hazards Robert Mueller's Russia probe holds for Trump and his inner circle, the ongoing investigations elsewhere are likely to hold far more legal jeopardy of the criminal variety over time, especially if Trump doesn't win re-election.
Trump is reportedly keenly aware of the legal “hellscape” he's facing beyond Mueller, according to the Daily Beast, and late last year he began encouraging his legal team to stick around even after Mueller concludes his investigation.
Even after the special counsel delivers his report, a slate of sealed indictments filed in the D.C. federal courthouse might actually outlive Mueller's appointment.
At this very moment, members of Trump's inner circle, including his family members, could be indicted and not even know it.
