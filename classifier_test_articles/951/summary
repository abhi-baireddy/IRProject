A migrant who repeatedly raped his 11-year-old step-daughter in Ireland has been jailed for 12 years.
In her victim impact statement, the girl said the family were experiencing financial and other implications from the man no longer being in the home.
He had pleaded not guilty one count of oral rape, 12 counts of rape and three counts of defilement of the same girl on dates between 2011 and 2017.
The court heard the man effectively controlled the victim during the time of the offences in a domestic situation where he was a position of authority.
He said the man does not accept the jury verdicts on the other counts.
