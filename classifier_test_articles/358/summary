The House voted Tuesday afternoon to block Donald Trumpâ€™s border wall national emergency, 245-182.
Just 13 Republicans voted with Democrats, keeping the final tally low enough to demonstrate that an override of a Trump veto would not be possible.
Thus far, there are three Republicans saying they will vote against Trump: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Thom Tillis.
One Republican, Roger Wicker, has been back and forth and noncommittal, but is probably not anxious to be that 51st vote against Trump.
Or, possibly, he cares more about protecting Trump and the Republican Party than about the institutions of our government.
