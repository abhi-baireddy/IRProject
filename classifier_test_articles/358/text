House Democrats keep the pressure on Trump.

The House voted Tuesday afternoon to block Donald Trump’s border wall national emergency, 245-182. Just 13 Republicans voted with Democrats, keeping the final tally low enough to demonstrate that an override of a Trump veto would not be possible.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is required by law. Thus far, there are three Republicans saying they will vote against Trump: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Thom Tillis. All Democrats will vote for this resolution and against Trump, so that makes 50. One Republican, Roger Wicker, has been back and forth and noncommittal, but is probably not anxious to be that 51st vote against Trump.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is playing dumb, saying he’s just a simple country law school graduate and trying to figure out the separation of powers is beyond his abilities, so he really can’t say if Trump’s emergency declaration is legal. He apparently flunked the Article I part of constitutional law. Or, possibly, he cares more about protecting Trump and the Republican Party than about the institutions of our government.
