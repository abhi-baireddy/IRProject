Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., unwilling to give up on claims that Donald Trump colluded with Russia despite special counsel Robert Mueller's conclusion, has launched a new front against the president.

This one involves subpoenas for the bank records of Deutsche Bank.

CourthouseNews reported Trump previously warned he would consider such action crossing a "red line."

"Trump had been referring to Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation at the time, but two congressional committees in the control of Democrats ran roughshod over that boundary on Tuesday," the report said.

Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, long has insisted he saw clear evidence of collusion.

Now, Schiff, arguing his role is different than Mueller, has subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and possibly other banks, claiming "potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process."

House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California launched a parallel bid investigating "the potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes," the report said.

The Congress members may be using as a foundation for their investigation the statements of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who was convicted of lying.

The report quoted Eric Trump, a son of the president and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, calling the legal demands "an unprecedented abuse of power and simply the latest attempt by House Democrats to attack the president and our family for political gain."
