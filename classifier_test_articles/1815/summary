Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., unwilling to give up on claims that Donald Trump colluded with Russia despite special counsel Robert Mueller's conclusion, has launched a new front against the president.
CourthouseNews reported Trump previously warned he would consider such action crossing a "red line."
Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, long has insisted he saw clear evidence of collusion.
Now, Schiff, arguing his role is different than Mueller, has subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and possibly other banks, claiming "potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process."
The Congress members may be using as a foundation for their investigation the statements of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who was convicted of lying.
