Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) Monday evening Fox News town hall event was the most-watched town hall event of the 2020 campaign thus far, according to early Nielsen data.
That total viewership bested CNN’s Bernie Sanders town hall event from back in February; and it doubled MSNBC’s during the same time period on Monday evening, and nearly tripled CNN’s.
The prior town hall ratings record for the 2020 cycle was a CNN-hosted event with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), which drew 1.95 million total viewers.
But the success of Sanders’ town hall event—both in terms of ratings and the headlines generated—comes as at least four other presidential campaigns consider being involved in a similar event.
Fox News announced on Wednesday afternoon that it will hold a town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in Milwaukee on May 8, with Baier and MacCallum once again hosting.
