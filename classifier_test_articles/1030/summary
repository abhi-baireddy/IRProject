RALEIGH, N.C. — The Republican candidate whose narrow lead in a North Carolina congressional race was thrown out because of suspicions of ballot fraud announced Tuesday he will not run in the newly ordered do-over election, saying he needs surgery late next month.
He did not mention the alleged ballot fraud scandal.
State election officials grew concerned about reports that an operative working for Harris was illegally tampering with absentee ballots.
Harris last week stopped a special state elections board hearing by declaring he couldn’t continue to testify.
The state elections board turned over evidence of his actions in 2017 to federal prosecutors, who took no action.
