JPMorgan has turned the traditional banking strategy on its head, using credit cards to bring in new customers rather than starting them out with a checking account.
The bank's early success in opening new branches has been fueled by card customers eager to open a checking account, according to the consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith.
For years, the traditional approach to consumer banking was to get a customer's checking account and then look to sell them other products, such as mortgages, auto loans, and investment advice.
The largest US bank has used its credit cards, including the hugely successful Chase Sapphire cards, as a way to acquire new customers.
Of course, JPMorgan isn't content to just rely on credit cards to bring in new customers.
