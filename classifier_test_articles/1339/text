Satan’s party.

On Monday evening Senate Democrats once again blocked a cloture measure that would prohibit infanticide.

Senators voted 53-44 on a bill from Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) that would penalize doctors who fail to “exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.

The bill did not pass its cloture vote.

2020 Democrat presidential candidates Senators Kamala Harris (CA), Bernie Sanders (VT), Cory Booker (NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), Amy Klobuchar (MN), and Elizabeth Warren (MA) all voted “NO” on this bill that would have required doctors to provide proper degree of care to babies born alive after attempted abortion.

President Trump lashed out at Democrats after they failed vote to protect newborn babies from murder.

On Monday night Planned Parenthood director Leana Wen, M.D., attacked President Trump for defending babies.

The President of the United States is lying to the American people about the Sasse bill. What @RealDonaldTrump is saying has no basis in medicine—or reality. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) February 26, 2019

We should all speak up and fight back when @RealDonaldTrump is spreading lies & deliberate misinformation. The Sasse bill is about criminalizing doctors and taking away the right to safe, legal abortion. #ProtectProviders — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) February 26, 2019

Dr. Wen and Planned Parenthood have no shame in supporting the slaughter of babies before birth and after birth.

And Democrats support this.

Pure evil.
