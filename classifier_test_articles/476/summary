Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals.
The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600.
Wuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat.
The inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency.
