Washington â€” House Democrats unveiled a proposal Wednesday to bolster the country's infrastructure to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, in what would be "phase four" of the congressional response to the outbreak.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters in a conference call that the House's "interest in infrastructure has always been bipartisan."
The plan builds upon a framework first introduced by Democrats in January, which would cost an estimated $760 billion over five years.
In an interview with CNN Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi said she did not believe House Democrats were acting too quickly on phase four legislation.
Mr. Trump said during the coronavirus task force briefing Wednesday that he supports phase four legislation addressing infrastructure.
