Border Patrol agents in southern Arizona used a military Black Hawk helicopter to track down and arrest immigrants who were decked out in camouflage clothing as they illegally crossed from Mexico into the United States.
Military pilots flew the helicopters while Border Patrol agents looked for illegal crossers.
#USBP agents in AZ arrested 75 illegal aliens with assistance from National Guard helicopter crews working under #OperationGuardianSupport.
The National Guard was first deployed to the southern border last April and again in the fall.
