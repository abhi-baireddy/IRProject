In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a megachurch in Birmingham, AL is partnering with a local health center to provide coronavirus drive-thru testing at one of the church's campuses.
The Church of the Highlands in association with Christ Health Center is offering COVID-19 drive-thru testing at its Grant Mills campus located at 4700 Highlands Way.
Even as one church works to help with the health care response to the outbreak, another church has been hit by it.
After testing, doctors told Strong his wife has COVID-19 in addition to a blood clot, viral pneumonia, and sepsis.
"She's in isolation in the hospital with what the doctors told us was COVID-19," Strong told the website on Wednesday.
