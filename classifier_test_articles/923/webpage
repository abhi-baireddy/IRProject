(AP) — A liberal challenger on Monday ousted a conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice endorsed by President Donald Trump, overcoming a successful push by Republicans to forge ahead with last week’s election even as numerous other states postponed theirs due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Joe Biden also emerged victorious, as expected, in the state’s Democratic presidential primary. Biden’s easy victory became academic when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out, one day after Wisconsin held in-person voting. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But the absentee-ballot-fueled victory by liberal Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky was a huge win for Democrats. It reduced conservative control of the court to 4-3, giving liberals a chance to take control in 2023.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Karofsky will now be on the court when the Republican-controlled Legislature tackles redistricting next year, a fight many expect to be decided by the state Supreme Court.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Her win will also certainly be seen as a bellwether in battleground Wisconsin ahead of the November presidential election. Trump barely carried the state four years ago, and both parties see it as critical this year.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More on Election 2020:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-82"><a class="link-0-2-83" href="/ec2dd8a06535b5f2412291ec99af3dd7">– <!-- -->Analysis: Will voters want a president who feels their pain?</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-82"><a class="link-0-2-83" href="/e45b0fd875cd2bf8be2b92330f37300f">– <!-- -->AP FACT CHECK: Trump misfires on watchdogs, mail-in voting</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-82"><a class="link-0-2-83" href="/253c16bc5813c5dbec0beafdb53489fc">– <!-- -->Voters reject Trump&#x27;s pick in chaotic Wisconsin court race  </a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Justice Dan Kelly was an early underdog in the Supreme Court race, given the expected higher Democratic turnout since the election was on the same day as the presidential primary. But the Supreme Court outcome became more uncertain as Biden emerged as the presumptive nominee in March and the coronavirus pandemic led to fears of in-person voting and closure of polling locations. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">With so much riding on turnout, the Republican push to proceed with the election was viewed by Democrats as a bid to suppress Democratic votes, particularly among minorities in Milwaukee.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Karofsky credited her win to voters rising up and rejecting Republican efforts to suppress turnout.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“People were willing to do that because they wanted their voices to be heard in this election,” she said. “A lot of times on election day we’re wringing our hands because we’re so upset about voter apathy. That wasn’t the problem on Tuesday. People wanted their voices heard.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Karofsky voter Caleb Andersen, of Milwaukee, worked the polls on election day and thought the hurdles put up to voting in person motivated some people to come out who wouldn’t have otherwise.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“I’m sure there’s some level of vindication,” Anderson said of the Karofsky win. “I do feel there was a lot of voter activity by people who were angered by the entire thing, the lack of availability of absentee ballots.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump last week broke from health experts and called on his supporters to “get out and vote NOW” for Kelly. He later said Democrats were playing politics by trying to postpone the election.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats said, ‘Oh, let’s move the election two months later,’” Trump said. “Now they talk about, ‘Oh, safety, safety.’”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump first voiced support for Kelly at a rally in January, far before concerns over the coronavirus led to calls for a delay in the election.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">After Democratic Gov. Tony Evers ordered the election postponed, the highly politicized Wisconsin Supreme Court backed Republicans in <a class="" href="/97db30e6564b9b5eedfc300234ea6630">proceeding with in-person voting </a><!-- --> in a ruling issued the day before the April 7 election. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Thousands of voters congregated for hours in long lines on April 7, defying social-distancing guidelines that led to the postponement of primaries in several other states. Milwaukee opened just five of 180 polling places due to a shortage of workers. </p><div id="afs:Content:8763360042" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-86">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-87 overrideArticle" href="/tag/Election2020">Election 2020</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Karofsky surged to victory behind a record-high number of absentee ballots — nearly as many as all the votes cast in a state Supreme Court race last year.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Wisconsin election crystallized what’s expected to be a high-stakes, <a class="" href="/e1a6172a1cd4429e379bba9216e6f8a3">state-by-state legal fight</a><!-- --> over how citizens can safely cast their ballots if the coronavirus outbreak persists into the November election.

Democrats earlier Monday called for moving a May 12 special congressional election in Wisconsin to mail-in only.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Returns weren’t allowed to be reported until Monday due to a quirk in the court battle over the election. Even before the counting began, a group of Milwaukee-area voters filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force a partial revote to protect the “thousands” of voters who they argue were disenfranchised by the turbulent election. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Many voters complained that they had <a class="" href="/8f424ec38b9d220db5efa9b3380050b7">requested absentee ballots that never arrived,</a><!-- --> forcing them to choose between sitting out the election or risking infection by voting in person. City officials in Milwaukee, as well as Wisconsin’s two U.S. senators, called on the U.S. Postal Service to investigate the complaints.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Evers

(AP) — A liberal challenger on Monday ousted a conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice endorsed by President Donald Trump, overcoming a successful push by Republicans to forge ahead with last week's election even as numerous other states postponed theirs due to the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Joe Biden also emerged victorious, as expected, in the state's Democratic presidential primary. Biden’s easy victory became academic when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out, one day after Wisconsin held in-person voting. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But the absentee-ballot-fueled victory by liberal Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky was a huge win for Democrats. It reduced conservative control of the court to 4-3, giving liberals a chance to take control in 2023.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Karofsky will now be on the court when the Republican-controlled Legislature tackles redistricting next year, a fight many expect to be decided by the state Supreme Court.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her win will also certainly be seen as a bellwether in battleground Wisconsin ahead of the November presidential election. Trump barely carried the state four years ago, and both parties see it as critical this year.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"9afd9530-6ae0-11ea-d9ab-e7cfa122f9b3\" class=\"related-story-embed\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Justice Dan Kelly was an early underdog in the Supreme Court race, given the expected higher Democratic turnout since the election was on the same day as the presidential primary. But the Supreme Court outcome became more uncertain as Biden emerged as the presumptive nominee in March and the coronavirus pandemic led to fears of in-person voting and closure of polling locations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With so much riding on turnout, the Republican push to proceed with the election was viewed by Democrats as a bid to suppress Democratic votes, particularly among minorities in Milwaukee.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Karofsky credited her win to voters rising up and rejecting Republican efforts to suppress turnout.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People were willing to do that because they wanted their voices to be heard in this election,” she said. “A lot of times on election day we’re wringing our hands because we’re so upset about voter apathy. That wasn’t the problem on Tuesday. People wanted their voices heard.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Karofsky voter Caleb Andersen, of Milwaukee, worked the polls on election day and thought the hurdles put up to voting in person motivated some people to come out who wouldn’t have otherwise.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m sure there’s some level of vindication,” Anderson said of the Karofsky win. “I do feel there was a lot of voter activity by people who were angered by the entire thing, the lack of availability of absentee ballots.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump last week broke from health experts and called on his supporters to “get out and vote NOW” for Kelly. He later said Democrats were playing politics by trying to postpone the election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats said, ‘Oh, let’s move the election two months later,’” Trump said. “Now they talk about, ‘Oh, safety, safety.‘”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump first voiced support for Kelly at a rally in January, far before concerns over the coronavirus led to calls for a delay in the election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Democratic Gov. Tony Evers ordered the election postponed, the highly politicized Wisconsin Supreme Court backed Republicans in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/97db30e6564b9b5eedfc300234ea6630\">proceeding with in-person voting \u003c/a> in a ruling issued the day before the April 7 election. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Thousands of voters congregated for hours in long lines on April 7, defying social-distancing guidelines that led to the postponement of primaries in several other states. Milwaukee opened just five of 180 polling places due to a shortage of workers. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Content:8763360042\" class=\"hub-link-embed\">Full Coverage: Election 2020\u003c/div>\u003cp>Karofsky surged to victory behind a record-high number of absentee ballots — nearly as many as all the votes cast in a state Supreme Court race last year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Wisconsin election crystallized what’s expected to be a high-stakes, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e1a6172a1cd4429e379bba9216e6f8a3\">state-by-state legal fight\u003c/a> over how citizens can safely cast their ballots if the coronavirus outbreak persists into the November election.

Though he has a visceral bond with his most loyal supporters, he’s far more likely to use grievance or even biting humor to make his case. His presumptive Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, meanwhile, is a politician defined by personal grief and loss, who has long had an ability to use his own family tragedies to connect with voters. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"954ab8a0-6ae0-11ea-cad4-65a413a552e2\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Biden owns the empathy marketplace,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. “But that’s just one quality. Sometimes bluster and a can-do attitude also matters.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Early polling in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/ff4d5bcb568f02e76af1a8945167c8b5\">the general election face-off between Trump and Biden\u003c/a> bears out a gap between the two contenders when it comes to who Americans see as more compassionate to their concerns. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In March, 43% of registered voters said Trump “cares about average Americans,” according to a Quinnipiac poll. Nearly 60% said Biden cares about average Americans, including 29% of registered Republican voters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think voters have recognized these traits in him all along, and will continue to because that’s who he is and has always been,” said Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware and a Biden supporter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Empathy has often been an intangible in presidential politics, helping some contenders overcome glaring weaknesses and sinking others who fail to display a genuine human connection with voters dealing with economic pain and other hardships. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8768171220\">Full Coverage: Election 2020\u003c/div>\u003cp>Biden witnessed that firsthand as Obama’s vice president during their 2012 reelection campaign. At the time, the economic recovery from the 2008 recession was sluggish at best and the unemployment rate still hovered around 8%. Yet polls showed voters overwhelmingly saw Obama as more empathetic to their economic struggles — particularly after Romney, a millionaire businessman, told wealthy donors that 47% of Americans viewed themselves as victims and thought they were entitled to government aid. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Biden arguably has more of a common touch than Obama, who may have bested Romney on empathy but was still often seen as cerebral and professorial. Biden is the opposite: a tactile, emotional politician whose own searing personal losses have played out in the public eye over decades. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Just weeks after he was first elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden’s wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident. In 2015, while he was serving as vice president, his son Beau succumbed to brain cancer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Biden can stumble through scripted campaign settings, he’s often at his best after events, when he wades into the crowd to greet voters one-on-one. It’s not uncommon to find voters who have come to share with Biden their own personal story of loss — nor is it uncommon for Biden to hand out his personal cellphone number, particularly to those whose lives have been touched by cancer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He nearly revealed his phone number during a nationally televised town hall last month when he took questions from Americans fearful about the growing pandemic and worried about the economic fallout. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Not that I’m an expert, but just having been there ... I’m so sorry for you,” Biden said, his voice filling with emotion. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden’s campaign is trying to use these moments for maximum political impact — although social distancing guidelines have made it a challenge. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last week the campaign launched what it’s calling “virtual ropelines” — 45-minute Zoom calls with a group of eight supporters. The campaign plans to make at least part of those conversations public. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump rarely puts himself in a small-group setting — either in person or virtually. His sustained, one-on-one interactions with voters are infrequent. He instead prefers commanding an audience from behind a podium at large campaign rallies — where he's more likely to make people laugh than cry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though he has held meetings during the pandemic with business executives, faith leaders and health care representatives, his most visible interactions in recent days have been with reporters at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/969eafc8f5cb01e9b3e8fe941b3264eb\">lengthy White House briefings\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Republican president often opens his daily briefings with prepared remarks in which he pays tribute to Americans facing difficulties. On Friday, he said he prayed that God “will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But those overtures are often quickly overshadowed by the president’s sparring with journalists, criticism of governors who say they can’t get the supplies their states need and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\">his often inaccurate claims\u003c/a> about solutions on the horizon. It's all punctuated by his social media posts, in which he frequently touts the television ratings for the coronavirus briefings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of Trump’s allies cringe at those comments but also know well that there is little that can be done to change the president’s approach. Throughout his presidency, Trump has mingled moments of sorrow and challenge with political combat, perhaps most notably when he spent days publicly feuding with the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, after a hurricane devastated the American territory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That approach might doom other politicians. But Trump has repeatedly upended political norms, casting aside the traditional expectations many Americans have for their president, even in the midst of a crisis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota and a Republican, said that while Trump is not always outwardly compassionate, his actions may matter more than his words. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you’re drowning and one bystander says they understand while another says nothing but tosses you a life vest — which person is more empathetic?” Pawlenty said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the end of Friday’s briefing — Trump's longest to date, at 2 hours, 16 minutes — the president briefly revealed, in his own way, that the crisis has struck an emotional chord. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“These are the saddest news conferences that I’ve ever had,” Trump said. “I don’t like doing them. You know why? I’m talking about death.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>EDITOR'S NOTE — Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

Trump distorts that record to make Fine and other public servants look like plants or holdovers from President Barack Obama.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fine has been acting Pentagon inspector general for more than four years, and before that was inspector general at the Justice Department for a decade, including the entire duration of the George W. Bush administration. He now reverts to the position of principal deputy inspector general at the Pentagon.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, many serve presidents of both parties.

There is no evidence that the report was “wrong” or politically motivated. Again, he insinuates that a longtime civil servant is an Obama loyalist out to get him. The inspector general in charge of the report is a government employee whose tenure predates the Obama administration.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Content:8780180692\" class=\"hub-link-embed\">Full Coverage: AP Fact Check\u003c/div>\u003cp>The report was based on \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/5cd379d2e431e596234d0d05d52af6ad\">a survey of 323 hospitals\u003c/a> around the country in late March and reported conditions they described. It did not make any judgments about the federal health department or the Trump administration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With coronavirus cases rocketing toward their expected peak, the inspector general’s office reported that a shortage of tests and long waits for results were at the root of mounting problems faced by hospitals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Overseeing the report was Christi A. Grimm, who is acting as HHS inspector general. She is a career government manager who took over the position early this year in an interim capacity. Grimm began her career with the agency in 1999, serving both Republican and Democratic administrations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A week ago \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/57def4c165e6f2ea1d4bf1b0091e4101\">Trump fired Michael Atkinson\u003c/a>, the intelligence community inspector general who forwarded to Congress a whistleblower complaint that ultimately led to the president’s impeachment in the House. His career at the Justice Department dated back to the early Bush administration, and it was Trump who nominated him as inspector general for intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>VOTING FRAUD\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!” — tweet Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “Mail ballots — they cheat. OK? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they’re cheaters. They go and collect them. They’re fraudulent in many cases.” — briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “You get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room, signing ballots all over the place. ... I think if you vote, you should go.” — briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Voting fraud is rare. Trump's push for in-person voting in a pandemic, such as in Wisconsin last week, also contradicts the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and his task force’s social distancing guidelines, which urge Americans to maintain 6 feet (1.8 meters) of separation and avoid crowds of over 10 people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The CDC \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/election-polling-locations.html\">specifically recommends\u003c/a> states “encourage mail-in methods of voting if allowed in the jurisdiction\" given the coronavirus threat. Late last week, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services \u003ca href=\"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/040920.htm\">said it was monitoring \u003c/a> the potential spread of the virus during Tuesday's voting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s true that some election studies have shown a slightly higher incidence of mail-in voting fraud compared with in-person voting, but the overall risk is extremely low. The Brennan Center for Justice said in 2017 the risk of voting fraud is 0.00004% to 0.0009%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Trump is simply wrong about mail-in balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud,” Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/09/trump-is-wrong-about-dangers-absentee-ballots/\">wrote in an op-ed\u003c/a> this week. “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee-ballot scandals, problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail, including the heavily Republican state of Utah.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump cast an absentee ballot by mail in last month’s Florida Republican primary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When asked about that contradiction Tuesday, he told reporters that it was fine “because I’m allowed to” vote by mail and that he didn’t expect to get to Florida.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A commission Trump convened after the 2016 election to investigate potential voting fraud disbanded without producing any findings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>VIRUS TESTING\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “Initially speaking, the tests were old, obsolete, and not really prepared. We have a brand-new testing system that we developed very quickly, and that’s your result.” — news briefing on April 6.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “This administration inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work.” — news briefing on March 30.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: His assertion that he inherited a “broken” and “obsolete” COVID-19 test from the Obama administration is false. The novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year, so there was no test to inherit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instead struggled to develop its own test for the coronavirus in January, later discovering problems in its kits sent to state and county public health labs in early February.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It took the CDC more than two weeks to come up with a fix to the test kits, leading to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/1b92ce21f8ddf7eefb634b92fee38fed\">delays in diagnoses\u003c/a> through February, a critical month when the virus took root in the U.S. Not until Feb. 29 did the Food and Drug Administration decide to allow labs to develop and use their own coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them, speeding up the supply. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meantime the U.S. bypassed a test that the World Health Organization quickly made available internationally. Trump has said that test was flawed; it wasn't.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: \"“We are leading the world now in testing by far.” — news briefing Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: \"America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world. ... Now we’re performing them at a level that nobody has ever seen before.” — news briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “Nobody has done more testing. ... If (other countries) did the kind of testing proportionally that we are doing, they’d have many more cases than us.” — briefing on April 6.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He's wrong to say the U.S. has done more tests “proportionally” than other countries. More broadly, his frequent boasts about testing mask what his own officials have called a failure of the system. The U.S. has notably lagged on this vital front.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for proportional testing, South Korea is just one of the countries with better testing rates. It also has fewer known cases of COVID-19, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of its population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One test has been done for every 100 South Koreans, compared with one for every 150 Americans, according to figures in recent days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Altogether, South Korea has conducted nearly 500,000 tests; the U.S. has conducted over 2.2 million. But South Korea’s population is six times smaller. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. only recently surpassed South Korea in the total number of tests, even though both countries reported their first confirmed cases on the same day in January.\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. testing continues to be constrained by shortages of key supplies, including sampling swabs, and backlogs of unprocessed tests.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ECONOMIC RELIEF\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, with his daughter Ivanka in the Roosevelt Room of the White House: “She created over 15 million jobs.” — speaking Tuesday with bankers via video conference about virus aid for small businesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: That’s a complete illusion. Before the coronavirus became widespread, less than half that many jobs were added to the entire U.S. workforce during Trump’s presidency, and his daughter was not responsible for them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The president is referring to a White House initiative led by Ivanka Trump that garnered nonbinding commitments from companies to provide 14 million or so training opportunities in the years ahead. Training for a job is not working at a job for money.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s no telling how many workers were already going to be trained, absent the initiative. In many cases, the pledge simply confers a presidential seal of approval on what some companies were doing anyway. By having companies sign the pledge, the administration is relying on the private sector to take on more of the financial burden of training workers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>(And now, job gains under Trump have been more than wiped out by the pandemic.)\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, on a federal emergency lending program for small businesses: “I’m hearing it’s a very, very successful rollout.” — news briefing Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “As of today, Small Business (Administration) has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much-needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already ... we’re way ahead of schedule.” — news briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He’s glossing over reality. There have been \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/1804383d7b1b9633e265a78d5c6984ee\">substantial delays\u003c/a>, with few loans issued.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The $349 billion emergency lending program just began operating April 3, but the rollout has been plagued by a host of problems. Small-business owners have complained that they are unable to get through to the SBA or the banks to apply for loans or that they are being rejected by banks that say they are accepting applications only from businesses that are already customers of the bank.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two of the nation’s largest banks, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank, weren’t initially set up to take applications.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The SBA’s loan processing system then stopped working early in the week, making it impossible for loans to be approved and money distributed, while confusion spread about the documents that lenders needed from customers to complete loan transactions. That’s according to a trade group for community bankers and the CEO of an online lending marketplace. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump was actually citing the value of applications received at the time but yet to be fully administered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had predicted before the program started that loans could be turned around and money transferred to businesses’ bank accounts the same day as applications were received. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE VIRUS THREAT\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, referring to his past comparisons of the coronavirus to the flu: “You said I said it was just like a flu. So the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu. ... It was in 1917, 1918. And anywhere from 50 to 100 million people died. That was a flu, OK? So, you could say that I said it was a flu, or you could say, ‘The flu is nothing to sneeze at.’” — briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He’s revising history — both his own and that of the century-old pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump never suggested the coronavirus was akin to the pandemic Spanish flu, which spread from early 1918 to late 1920 and killed over 50 million worldwide. On the contrary, he repeatedly dismissed COVID-19 from January until mid-March as being less of a danger than the common flu and something that would mysteriously disappear soon enough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In February, he asserted that coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down, not up,” and told Fox Business it will be fine because “in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for,” he told reporters on Feb. 26. “And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two days before the WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump still presented a sunny outlook on COVID-19. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,” he tweeted March 9. “It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And in a Fox News virtual town hall March 24, Trump rejected likening the coronavirus to the 1918 pandemic. “You can’t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died. That was a flu, which — a little different,” he said, overstating the likely death toll of that pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, asked about the wisdom of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/84d346817770d2841d22efcd833fa7e0\">freezing funding to the WHO\u003c/a> during a pandemic: “I’m not saying I’m going to do it, but we’re going to look at it.” Told he had said minutes earlier he would freeze funding, he said, “No, I didn’t. I said we’re going to look at it.” — briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Actually, he said earlier in the briefing that he was going to freeze U.S funding to the organization.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO,” he said. ”We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He’s unhappy with the organization’s coronavirus recommendations. The United States contributed nearly $900 million to its budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency’s website, an amount that represented one-fifth of the WHO’s total budget for those years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, Trump said he'll make an announcement about WHO soon. “We're going to be talking about that subject next week,” he told reporters. \"We’ll have a lot to say about it. We’ll hold it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MALARIA DRUG\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, on the government’s decision to stockpile millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine to make it available for patients with COVID-19: “You’re not going to die from this pill. ... I really think it’s a great thing to try, just based on what I know. Again, I’m not a doctor.” — news briefing Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “What do you have to lose? I’ll say it again: What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it’s their choice and it’s their doctor’s choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine — try it, if you’d like.” — news briefing on April 4.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “They say taking it before the fact is good. ... It can help them but it’s not going to hurt them.” — news briefing on April 5.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He’s making unverified claims about a drug that can have serious side effects and may not work. The drug has not been approved as a treatment for COVID-19, and Trump’s own health experts say more studies are needed to know whether it’s safe and effective to use.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president has been talking up hydroxychloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. Research studies are now beginning to test if the drugs truly help COVID-19 patients, and the FDA has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile as an option for doctors to consider for patients who cannot get into one of the studies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the drug has major potential side effects, especially for the heart, and large studies are underway. The FDA says people should not take it without a prescription and emphasizes that the malaria drugs being explored \"are not FDA-approved for treatment of COVID-19.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in a joint statement warned against “prophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for COVID-19.” That means prescribing a medicine for the purpose of warding off a disease or preventing its spread.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, explaining his hesitancy to suspend U.S. domestic flights to stem spread of the virus: “They’re generally very, very empty planes. ... There’s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes.” — news briefing on April 6.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: False.
