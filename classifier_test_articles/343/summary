The Supreme Court seemed poised Wednesday to protect a 40-foot World War One memorial cross on public land in Bladensburg, Maryland, from a lawsuit that argues it violates the Constitution.
The American Legion built the Peace Cross to honor the World War One dead of Prince George’s County in 1925.
Justice Elena Kagan — who defended a cross memorial as solicitor general in the Obama administration — seemed to agree with that proposition, noting the cross stood without objection for over 90 years.
The plaintiffs say that the Peace Cross violates the First Amendment’s ban on religious favoritism.
The Legion and other veterans groups still host annual programs at the Peace Cross.
