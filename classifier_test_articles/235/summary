An illegal immigrant from Mexico died early Friday after jumping the border, getting caught and being put inside a Border Patrol vehicle, the agency announced.
The man, who wasn’t identified, came over the border near Cuevitas, Texas, as part of a group of people.
He was caught and put into the vehicle while agents nabbed other migrants in the group.
“This loss of life is tragic, despite the best efforts of our Border Patrol agents and medical professionals,” said Brian Hastings, chief of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector.
The death came just hours before the U.S. is slated to seal off the border with Mexico amid coronavirus fears.
