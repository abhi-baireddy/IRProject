Beyoncé's "Homecoming" Coachella documentary, released Wednesday at midnight, inspired frenzied reactions among her fans on Twitter – the same reaction that normally accompanies everything the pop icon does.
She reveals how she was "limiting myself to no bread, no carbs, no sugar, no dairy, no fish, no alcohol."
"We all want a Beyoncé body but who’s doing 'no bread, no carbs, no meat, no dairy, no sugar, no alcohol?'"
Her words inspired at least one Twitter user to take her lead, with one "Homecoming" viewer writing, "Me, writing down Beyoncé’s workout plan to get fine after having twins.
"Homecoming" is streaming now on Netflix, with a live album of the same name available on music streaming services.
