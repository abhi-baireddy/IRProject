The Houston Public Library has apologized for featuring a convicted child molester last fall during its “Drag Queen Storytime” series.
“A media spokesperson for the library confirmed one of the program’s drag queens, Tatiana Mala Nina, is Alberto Garza, a 32-year-old child sex offender,” reports local TV station KHOU.
Because 2013’s Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges forcibly instituted genderless marriages into the nation’s legal regime, public schools are now legally bound to teach about gay sex in sex ed.
Well, the bill would mandate that children learn about “the relational or sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals,” and “gender, gender expression, gender identity” — i.e., transgenderism.
And if we’re all gay, gay doesn’t mean anything, and there’d be no need to teach it to four-year-olds.
