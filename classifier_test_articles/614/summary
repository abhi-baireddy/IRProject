Asked why he supported “open borders” at a recent Iowa town hall, Bernie Sanders responded that he did not.
His decrying “open borders” was a case in point: the comment was politically unnecessary, played into a right-wing nativist trap, and misconstrued the political economy of migration.
Unfortunately, Bernie articulated his opposition to “open borders” using language that legitimates false and dangerous right-wing nativist talking points.
There are no doubt libertarian calls for “open borders” emanating from the Cato Institute.
Bernie is also the only candidate with an economic and foreign policy agenda consonant with substantive support for immigrant rights.
