Exclusive: Multiple sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one five eyes nation, and to the Trump administration, report that Special Counsel Mueller is going to indict all three of Donald Trump’s oldest children along with Jared Kushner.

Donald J Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, and Mr. Kushner will all be indicted, these sources said, although they were not clear if the indictments would all be revealed at once.

Multiple sources also reported a fierce debate raging within the Justice Department over how to handle the fact that President Trump is himself indicted. At time of writing, some sources believed that Trump’s own indictments were more likely than not to be kept under seal until he is out of office, although no sources were definitive on this point.

One public report in the U.S. Spectator predicted that Mueller’s report may come as soon as tomorrow, Friday March 8th. Patribotics sources, in more than one nation, also say the report is imminent. One senior source characterized its contents by saying it would be “Not good for anyone named Trump”.
