The Internet Research Agency (IRA) is one of the Russian agencies involved in the country’s all-too-successful 2016 efforts to support Donald Trump and wreck the U.S. election system.
But on Election Day 2018, the IRA’s ongoing role in election interference earned them something else—a direct attack from the NSA’s Cyber Command.
As the Washington Post reports, U.S. Cyber Command fired more than a warning shot across IRA’s bow, demonstrating an ability to completely shut down the state-sponsored hackers by taking away their internet access.
“They basically took the IRA offline,” according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.
The IRA still seems to be active in, among other things, cyber intrusion and using both human and bot trolls to direct social media conversations.
