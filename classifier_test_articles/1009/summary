Well, get ready for what is turning out to be the tedious next chapter in a Tolstoy-length novel of pure Hillary-blaming, by none other than “Whining Donald” Trump.
The strategy, cooked up by Trump and his team of bloodsucking lawyers, is to change the subject of the Mueller Report to Hillary instead.
According to Vanity Fair, it was Hillary all along who concocted the Steele Dossier, by colluding with the Russians.
So the Steele dossier had no pro-Democrat agenda at its inception.
That its conclusions were steeply unfavorable to Trump is a problem Whining Donald will have to take up with reality, a thing with which he is at continuous war anyway, so it should be familiar territory.
