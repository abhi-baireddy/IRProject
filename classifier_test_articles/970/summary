Yesterday, President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a huge show out of releasing their plans for the “biggest tax cut in history,” promising “massive” help for the middle class.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof skewered Trump’s tax plan in a brutal op-ed published today which sums the situation up perfectly: “This Isn’t Tax Policy; It’s a Trump-Led Heist.”Trump’s new tax “plan” (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself.
President Trump’s tax plan is specifically designed to eliminate what little tax he already does pay.
This is the very opposite of “populism.” Trump’s “tax plan” is nothing less than an act of class warfare by the ultrawealthy elites.
When asked how this will help the middle class, Secretary Mnuchin had no answers.
