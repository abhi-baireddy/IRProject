On issue after issue, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic majority has chosen a path of partisanship, rather than problem-solving.
The latest example is the House Democrats’ failure to even propose a budget, a core responsibility of any congressional majority.
While House Democrats have kicked basic budget-writing to the curb, they have not been shy about offering a litany of big-spending proposals with no way to pay for them.
Yet the Democratic majority, on 32 separate occasions, has blocked it from receiving an up-or-down vote.
These first 100 days have shone a spotlight on how disconnected House Democrats are from the rest of the country.
