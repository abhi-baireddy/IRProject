(CNN) Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams have become the first members of Congress to test positive for coronavirus , a grim new indicator of the virus' aggressive spread.
"Today I learned that I tested positive," he said in a statement released on Twitter.
A Republican aide told CNN that the Capitol physician is now in contact with members who might have been exposed by Diaz-Balart and McAdams.
"I have just been informed that my colleague, Mario Diaz-Balart, tested positive for COVID-19," Scalise said in a statement.
Earlier Wednesday, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers sent a letter to congressional leadership requesting just that.
