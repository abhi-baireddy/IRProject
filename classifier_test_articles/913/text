This is curious. By several accounts, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was expected to leave the Department of Justice shortly after William Barr was confirmed as Attorney General. Now a month later Rosenstein is still there with no plans to leave (yet).

#NEW Deputy AG #RodRosenstein has reached an agreement w/ Attorney General William Barr to stay on at @TheJusticeDept "a little while longer,” despite initial plans to step down by now.

Speculation has long been that Rosenstein would want to stay on until the Mueller investigation was completed. But it hasn’t been easy. Behind the scenes, it’s clear he has been on thin ice with Donald Trump. Back in February Trump even accused Rosenstein of treason.
