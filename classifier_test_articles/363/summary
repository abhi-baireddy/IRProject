The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Office of General Counsel and Media Bureau rejected a petition by the progressive Free Press on Monday to “weaponize” the agency against broadcasters and conservatives to censor political speech.
Free Press recently petitioned the FCC to censor broadcasters from showing President Donald Trump’s press conferences on the coronavirus outbreak.
Pai said:Under my leadership, the FCC has always stood firmly in defense of Americans’ First Amendment freedoms, including freedom of the press.
The Free Press petition misinterprets the agency’s rules.
“The Federal Communications Commission believes that freedom of the press is essential to a free society and a functioning democracy,” the FCC concluded in its letter to Free Press.
