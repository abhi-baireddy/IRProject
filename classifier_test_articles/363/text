On Tuesday, Markos Moulitsas joined Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily to share his thoughts on Bernie Sanders’s town hall on Fox News, Pete Buttigieg’s rapid rise, and what it all means for the Democratic presidential primary. According to Moulitsas, Sanders’s appearance on Fox—and Buttigieg being in talks to appear on Fox—are concerning especially because “[Trump] clearly believes the network is his, and it’s operated as such … it has basically become his propaganda arm.”

As recently as yesterday, Trump even referred to the network in first person (“we” having Donna Brazile refers to the former DNC chair joining the network recently as a paid contributor).

x So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the Ã¢ÂÂaudienceÃ¢ÂÂ was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile? Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2019
