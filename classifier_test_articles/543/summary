Cairo (AFP) - Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas announced Saturday a cut of all ties with Israel and the United States, including security cooperation, after Washington unveiled a controversial Middle East plan seen as favouring Israel.
His comments came as the Arab League rejected US President Donald Trump's plan, which had enraged Palestinians.
- 'Minimum rights' -The Cairo meeting brought together senior Arab officials, including Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and the United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs.
- 'Violation of accords' -Abbas told the Arab League the US plan was in "violation of the (autonomy) accords" launched in Oslo in 1993 by Israel and the Palestinians.
Abbas said that while Israel would immediately start annexation, under the plan the Palestinians would have to wait four years, until they show "good will", to get a limited state.
