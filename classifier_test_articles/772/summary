Beto O’Rourke speaks with supporters during a three day road trip, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, March 15, 2019.
Beto O’Rourke is stoking up one the great bonfires of modern political history; he is a phenomenon of these strange times so unique that no one could have imagined him.
AdvertisementAll of the Democratic candidates and the entire political process are being taken over and occupied by the invasion of the whole public space by Robert Francis O’Rourke.
The mighty and malicious meat-grinder of the American national political media, twitching and drooling in anticipation, is turning toward Beto, scarcely believing the noisy and juicy helplessness of this victim.
The national political media are a savage beast, and they are now an extremely vicious beast because they have been beaten badly by President Trump.
