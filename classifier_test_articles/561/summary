Preliminary data analysis by Mother Jones finds that Black people overall have disproportionately contracted and died from the coronavirus.
In Michigan, Black people are 14 percent of the state’s population but 33 percent of its coronavirus cases and 40 percent of its deaths.
The CDC has since released racial data on 10 states.
In Mississippi, where 90 percent of counties are particularly vulnerable, Black people make up 38 percent of the state’s population and a startling 66 percent of COVID-19 fatalities.)
