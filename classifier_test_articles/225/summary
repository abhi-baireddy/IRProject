Doug and Eric Alberts are trying to round up the surviving hogs on their 9-acre farm in Fremont, Nebraska.
"Honestly, I didn't expect to see nothing alive, from the pictures we'd seen," Eric told CBS News.
"When we came in with the boat and it was still 5 feet deep... we didn't expect nothing to be here."
As the weather warms and snow melts, more flooding is expected in places like North Dakota and Minnesota.
