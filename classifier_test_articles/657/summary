Alabama lawmakers are considering a bill this week that would ban all abortions in the state by making the killing of an unborn baby a felony.
State House Bill 314, sponsored by Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, would make an abortion and attempted abortion a felony.
The state Senate Judiciary Committee also is expected to consider the companion bill (Senate Bill 211) sometime this week.
â€œThey are trying to tee this up as an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade and its progeny.
In 2012, the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a personhood bill as unconstitutional because it recognized unborn babies as human beings who deserve the right to life.
