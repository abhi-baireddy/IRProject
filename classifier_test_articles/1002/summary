On Thursday, a New York appeals court gave Summer Zervos the green light to proceed with her defamation lawsuit against Trump.
A former contestant on The Apprentice, Zervos claimed that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent.
Trump denied the allegations, calling them “100% false” and a “hoax.” Zervos then sued Trump under New York law for defamation, claiming that he damaged her reputation by falsely painting her as a liar.
Also on Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James made a new filing in the state’s lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation.
Under federal law, migrants who prove they were “abused, abandoned, or neglected” by their parents are entitled to a pathway to lawful permanent residence.
