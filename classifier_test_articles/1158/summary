FILE PHOTO: Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker testifies before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Justice Department on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2019.
The Justice Department, which has already said Whitaker stands by his testimony, had no immediate comment.
A House Judiciary Committee spokesman and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.
Berman is a former law partner of another Trump attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Nadler said then that media reports contradicted Whitaker’s testimony and that “several individuals” had direct knowledge of phone calls Whitaker denied receiving from the White House.
