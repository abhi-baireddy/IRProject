President Trump said Wednesday Attorney General Bill Barr will hold a news conference Thursday following the release of his redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia probe –and suggested he would chime in as well.
“You’ll see a lot of strong things come out tomorrow.
Attorney General Barr is going to be doing a press conference.
Barr is expected to release the report to Congress and the public Thursday morning.
While the president has claimed that the nearly 400-page report “totally” exonerated him, Democrats aren’t buying it and plan to seek an unredacted copy of Mueller’s report, the culmination of a 23-month investigation.
