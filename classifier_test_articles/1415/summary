The storyYou've been hearing a lot about oil and gas lately...and about a squad called OPEC.
OPEC’s official mission is to keep oil prices stable by coordinating on policies and how much oil they produce at one time.
OPEC kept prices low in the hopes that those companies would decide the juice isn’t worth the squeeze, and fold up shop.
Either way, the last few years have been a stand off between Old School Oil (OPEC) and the New Kids on the Block (the US).
Low oil prices are a big part of why Venezuela's economy has tanked.
