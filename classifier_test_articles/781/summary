Yet those votes—rejecting the prime minister’s Brexit deal Tuesday, rejecting both the option of a no-deal Brexit and the option of a second referendum on Wednesday, and voting to delay exit Thursday—demonstrated that neither the ruling party nor any other parliamentary faction commands the majority to do that in practice.
As a result, Parliament had to debate and vote on whether it approved the initiation of the U.K.’s exit from the EU.
It appears as though the Prime Minister has lost control of Brexit, her government’s main preoccupation, and that Parliament has taken over.
Instead, the ERG favors a so-called “no-deal Brexit” wherein the U.K. leaves the European Union without any arrangements in place.
The majority of Parliament, however, finds a no-deal Brexit unacceptable, and last Wednesday voted to rule it out as an outcome.
