It’s early yet, but the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination for 2020 already seems like the most substantive primary contest in recent memory.
An intervention finally came earlier this month, when the former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, a candidate running near the bottom of the pack, unveiled the first detailed immigration platform of the 2020 campaign.
“People are not that interested in the legal immigration system,” he said.
“They’re almost entirely focussed on issues of border security and illegal immigration in the United States.
I think legal immigration is the most important piece, but, politically, in terms of what moves people, gets them interested, shapes the debate, it’s the least important.”Broad immigration reform is, obviously, also more politically difficult now, in a post-Trump climate.
