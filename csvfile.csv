https://www.vox.com/,"As the harms of social distancing become more and more apparent, Americans may start to wonder: Are we overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic?

A few people (although not most of the public) seem to think so. Some federal officials, from President Donald Trump to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), have asked if “the cure is proving worse than the disease itself.” Protesters in several states, including Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky, have called for lockdowns to end, arguing that the damage to the economy is too much to bear.

This is a question public health experts and officials expected from the start. As Kent State University epidemiologist Tara Smith told me, “It’s the paradox of public health: When you do it right, nothing happens.”

The problem with proper prevention, the linchpin of many public health strategies, is that there’s no clear indication when it works. There’s no public celebration when a coronavirus case or death doesn’t happen.

And in the meantime, the economic damage of closing down America is readily apparent. Some economists warn that the unemployment rate could surpass 30 percent. About 22 million have filed unemployment claims since social distancing measures took effect in March. The lines for food aid are stretching for blocks across the country. It’s now much more difficult — if not impossible — to visit family and friends and partake in many favorite hobbies and activities.

In other words, the benefits of social distancing aren’t very visible, while the pain from it is. That creates a situation in which it can be easy to take for granted that social distancing is, according to experts and models, likely preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US.

But it’s important to remind ourselves what we’re doing here. The US wants to avoid getting to the point where it’s obvious we did something wrong and need to correct course. We want to prevent what happened in Italy, Spain, or New York from happening across the country. That means reacting not just to what’s visible to us in the present, but what’s potentially in the future. Doing that will always at some level seem like an overreaction, even if it’s the right call.

“Anytime you are dealing with an outbreak, if it appears like you overreacted, then you probably did the right thing,” Krutika Kuppalli, a fellow in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity program, told me.

That’s particularly true for coronavirus. There’s still a lot we need to learn about the virus, but we do know it seems to spread at least in part through people who aren’t showing any symptoms. That means it can be spreading in communities without anyone — not even the people who are infected — knowing it. That requires taking action before the virus is clearly visible, at least without mass testing, in a community.

There’s also evidence from past outbreaks, particularly the 1918 flu pandemic, that reacting quickly and aggressively — even before a disease clearly poses a threat — is crucial both to saving lives and, in the long term, potentially keeping the economy intact.

Yes, it demands a shared sacrifice at this time. But it’s worth it. The alternative — that we let up to millions of people, including our friends, family, and peers, die — is so bad we need to do everything we can to prevent it.

The coronavirus requires what might seem like an overreaction

It’s true that we still don’t know enough about the SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. That can seem like a reason to not do much: Maybe the virus isn’t as contagious or as deadly as we think it is. Maybe it’ll die down in the summer with warmer weather. Maybe only specific segments of the general population are really vulnerable.

That’s all possible. But remember: Even if all of this and more turns out to be true in the future, the reality is we simply don’t know that now and didn’t know it before. We have to act with the best information we have. And that information suggests the coronavirus is really bad — whether it’s a huge outbreak in Wuhan, China, that forced the country to lock down, the outbreak in Italy that overwhelmed its health care system, or the outbreak in New York that has turned the US into the world’s leader in reported cases and deaths (with more than 639,000 and 30,000, respectively, as of April 16 — and both figures are likely underestimates).

We also know that the coronavirus can spread from people who don’t have symptoms yet or will never develop significant symptoms. That could mean the disease is less deadly than we think; if there are a lot more asymptomatic carriers than we realize, it could mean a way smaller fraction of the people who are infected are dying.

But it also means that the virus can spread before it’s even clearly visible in a community. That’s been particularly exacerbated by America’s poor testing capacity — a result of both poor pandemic preparedness generally and President Donald Trump’s slow reaction to the outbreak — leaving the country unable to quickly test people to see if there’s asymptomatic spread. (To this end, we actually underreacted to Covid-19, and have continued doing so by failing to scale up testing.)

“Your chance of the first case being the one that comes to your attention is very, very, very, very small,” George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the UCSF, told me. “By the time you have the first death, you have to figure that there’s been three full weeks of transmission, and there are at least several hundred cases in the population.”

So once a city, state, or country is reporting a few Covid-19 cases and especially deaths, it’s typically safe to assume there is a much bigger outbreak going on — just one that’s not fully visible, at least yet, to the public. Given that coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, it’s important for the public and officials to act quickly and preemptively to stop exponential growth.

It’s in this context that it’s so important that countries do what can feel like an overreaction. If you wait until there are already a bunch of cases or deaths in your community, it could be too late to prevent an outbreak that even extreme social distancing might be unable to get under control for weeks.

Consider the stories of California and New York. California actually reported some of the first coronavirus cases and deaths in the country — including the first case of community transmission — but now New York has 14 times the Covid-19 deaths as California. There are important differences between the states, such as New York City’s much higher population density and greater public transportation use. It’s also possible New York just got unlucky: “There’s the possibility that there were just more introductions of the virus in the East Coast, in the New York area,” Jeffrey Martin, an epidemiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told me.

But one likely contributor is that California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, reacted quicker to the outbreak. The Bay Area issued America’s first shelter-in-place order on March 16, and California issued a statewide stay-at-home order three days later — while New York didn’t until March 22. Even before the government mandates, some parts of California seemed to adopt social distancing early: Restaurant data from OpenTable suggests that seated dining on March 1 was down 2 percent in New York City, but it was down 18 percent in San Francisco. (Though it was only down by 3 percent in Los Angeles, so not every place in California acted the same.)

The extra days and weeks may not seem like that much time. But when coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, that short time span can be important. “With this virus, days, and even hours, matter,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

It could have been easy at the time to make the case that California and particularly the Bay Area were overreacting, given that the entire state had fewer than 25 deaths when it locked down. But it ultimately seems like it was the right decision.

Previous research is clear: Outbreaks require strong, early action

While there’s a lot about the coronavirus and the nature of this outbreak that we still don’t know, research from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was linked to as many as 100 million deaths globally and about 675,000 deaths in the US, provides some useful evidence for strong, early action.

A 2007 study in PNAS found that the places that took quicker action on social distancing — closing schools and banning big public gatherings — saw better outcomes:

[C]ities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (≈20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.

One example cited in the study is the difference between Philadelphia, which was slow to act, and St. Louis, which was faster. As this chart shows, St. Louis did a much better job of flattening the curve and averting excess deaths:

Another 2007 study, published in JAMA, validated the findings — showing places that acted earlier and more aggressively saved lives. But this study also demonstrated the importance of sustaining social distancing measures: When cities, including St. Louis, pulled back their measures too quickly, they saw a spike in deaths.

Here’s how that looks in chart form, with the line chart representing excess flu deaths and the black and gray bars below showing when social distancing measures were in place. The highest peak comes after social distancing measures were lifted, with the death rate falling only after they were reinstated.

This did not just happen in St. Louis. Analyzing data from 43 cities, the JAMA study found this pattern repeatedly across the country. Howard Markel, an author of the study and the director of the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine, described the results as a bunch of “double-humped epi curves” — officials instituted social distancing measures, saw flu cases fall, then pulled back the measures and saw flu cases rise again.

Notably, the second rise in deaths only appeared when cities removed social distancing measures, the JAMA study found: “Among the 43 cities, we found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect.”

While invoking social distancing is often presented as a choice between saving lives and sustaining the economy, there’s also some preliminary evidence that the early, aggressive actions help the economy in the long term as well. Dylan Matthews covered a recent study along these lines for Vox:

Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner released a working paper (not yet peer-reviewed) last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively. The three analyzed the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in the United States, as the closest (though still not identical) analogue to the current crisis. They compare cities in 1918-’19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later. Their conclusion? “We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over.”

The basic problem is that a lot of people getting sick and dying is also pretty bad for the economy — potentially worse than temporarily shutting the economy down.

The risk for us now, by believing we might be overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic, is thinking we can ease up on measures, doing it, and subsequently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths. In fact, that already appears to be happening in some parts of the world; Asian countries that initially contained the outbreak, such as South Korea and Singapore, are now reporting signs of a second wave of cases after easing some of their restrictions.

None of this completely eliminates the possibility that we are overreacting. Maybe a year or two from now we’ll realize that we didn’t have to close down certain parts of the country. Or maybe certain segments of the population could have remained at their jobs. Or maybe the warmer temperatures could slow the virus’s spread more than we think (though heat hasn’t been enough in Singapore, where it’s currently 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit). We just don’t know.

But as public health experts have told me, it’d be much better to end up second-guessing ourselves about whether we overreacted than whether we underreacted and maybe caused the deaths of millions. Because that’s the risk right now, based on the best evidence we have.

https://www.vox.com/,"I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

Share All sharing options for: I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

SEONGNAM, South Korea — On April 15, millions of people across South Korea donned face masks, rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer to cast their votes in a nationwide election.

Poll workers wore face protection, masks, and medical gloves. Upon arrival at the polling station, voters’ temperatures were taken, and anyone showing signs of fever was taken to a more secluded area of the building to cast their ballots. Separate polling stations were set up outside of hospitals for people infected with Covid-19 to vote.

The strict health and safety measures South Korea’s government put in place for election day could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the world — including the United States — on how to safely hold an election amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In-person voting is a risky prospect right now, as public health experts warn that having large numbers of people gather in small, enclosed areas like polling places is one of the surest ways to spread the extremely contagious coronavirus.

This scenario played out in Wisconsin last week, when Republican lawmakers and the state’s conservative-controlled Supreme Court rejected the Democratic governor’s attempts to postpone the state’s scheduled elections or change voting rules to allow people to vote by mail.

The result was a political and public health nightmare: Wisconsin voters were forced to either stay home and forfeit their votes or violate the state’s stay-at-home measures and risk their health to cast their votes in person at their local polling places. Thousands chose the latter option.

With little time to prepare, poll workers scrambled to do whatever they could to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Photos showed voters — many wearing masks, but some not — trying to maintain social distancing guidelines (remaining at least 6 feet apart) as best they could while standing in long lines waiting to vote, before being ushered into cramped schools, gyms, public libraries, and churches to cast their ballots.

The state’s public health officials have said it could be weeks before they know whether Wisconsin’s elections triggered a wider outbreak of the coronavirus, and some state party officials worry the chaos around the election has damaged its legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.

But as South Korea’s very different experience on Wednesday shows, things didn’t have to go that way.

South Korean voters had to go through extensive sanitization measures

As of election day, April 15, South Korea had nearly 10,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 220 deaths. The country saw its peak of Covid-19 cases on February 29, when it recorded more than 900 new cases. Now, a month and a half later, the number of new cases lingers at around 30 a day — one of the quickest turnarounds for any country struggling with the virus.

Experts credit the drastic drop in numbers to a proactive government that has pushed aggressive preventive measures and consistent testing. The government bet on these same methods to safely hold the first national election by a country during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Entering the polling station was an extensive process. My polling station in Pangyo, Seongnam, was a community center within my apartment complex. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10 am, which is when voters usually swarm to the polls.

As soon as I walked through the entrance, I had to stop at a “sanitizing station” where four officials stood armed with a thermometer that took my temperature when hovered above my forehead, several bottles of hand sanitizer, and boxes of disposable gloves.

Once they checked I had a mask on (I had brought one from home), they took my temperature to ensure that I showed no fever; those who had a temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) were escorted to a separate polling booth in a secluded area before being sent for virus testing. They then squeezed hand sanitizer into my palms and gave me gloves to cover my clean hands.

Officials had already marked the floors ahead of time with stickers spaced one meter (3.28 feet) apart to ensure that voters were safely distanced while standing in line. Most people adhered to the stickers, and when a few inched up to the people in front of them out of impatience, the head supervisor of the poll instantly shooed them back into place.

The only time I took off my mask was when an official compared my face with my photo ID, which was required in the South Korean elections, and the entire process only lasted about 10 seconds.

Once it was my turn, I walked into one of the four voting booths, lined up a few feet apart from the other voters, with two paper ballots in my hand. The stamp I used to mark my vote slipped a bit in my gloved hands, but the gloves were necessary since there weren’t sanitizer wipes available to wipe down any surfaces. The government said it would frequently sanitize polling stations, but the booth wasn’t disinfected before the next voter walked in after me.

Once I cast my ballot, I was ushered to a large pink trash bag taped to the wall, dedicated to the disposal of gloves. A poll worker pointed to the trash bag and then to my hands to indicate I needed to remove my gloves before leaving.

Despite the long line and multiple sanitization steps, I was in and out of the building in less than 10 minutes.

Separate polling booths were set up outside of hospitals for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, and those in more severe conditions mailed in their ballots.

The largest group the government had to address was the nearly 60,000 people in quarantine; 22.8 percent of these people — a total of 13,642 — applied to vote and were given the option to leave their houses at 5:20 pm to arrive at their polling stations by 6 pm, after the rest of the population finished voting.

They had an hour to cast their ballots and return to their homes by 7 pm. The BBC reported that they then had to call the government to announce their return home; failure to do so could lead to a visit from the police.

It’s an efficient system, but it’s not foolproof. There are still some risk factors that make experts like Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, wary.

Kim said it all depends on the cooperation of the quarantined people. If they fail to follow the rules, it could easily lead to another outbreak.

Related Democrats should make voting reform a nonnegotiable baseline for the next stimulus bill

“I’m concerned that some people might finish voting before 7 pm and use their remaining time to wander, such as going shopping or visiting coffee shops,” he said. “They may think they’re harmless because they don’t seem sick, but we already know that asymptomatic people can transfer the virus.”

Ultimately, the success of this election won’t be tested until two weeks from now, once the incubation period of the virus is over. But if there isn’t a major surge in cases by then, the US could learn a few lessons on how to successfully hold elections, especially as November inches closer.

Most people seemed to feel comfortable voting because of the government’s effective response to the pandemic

The masks, hand sanitizer, and plastic gloves may have been an odd sight, but in many ways, election day felt like any other election: Families arrived in groups at polling stations, some brought their pets, and neighbors greeted each other at the entrance.

Kim Yu-jin, 36, who wheeled her child in a stroller as she voted with her husband, said she was happy with the way the elections were held.

“The government was perfectly prepared,” she said. “As a country, we’ve already been doing a good job at social distancing, and individuals have been proactively using masks and hand sanitizer. Everyone’s been trying to be as cautious as possible, which helped boost the government’s efforts to ensure a safe election.”

Bu Kyeong-hee, 48, said opening the polls as planned was not only the best way to ensure a smooth election but also the most logical step for a country that is slowly easing back into normal life. She added that other countries could learn from the aggressive measures taken by both the government and individuals to prevent infections and maintain social distancing while proceeding with crucial democratic events.

Hwang Sung-ha, 37, also thought it was appropriate for the government to push forward with the election because people could have a direct say in picking officials who would rebuild the country ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Not everyone agrees, though: While Lee Kyeong-sook, 67, also said she was impressed by how the government handled the election, she said she had initially hoped for the government to postpone the event.

“My friends and I all agreed that we wished the government had delayed the election,” she said. “They’ve already been asking people my age to stay inside, so I wonder why they pushed for us to show up at the polls today.”

But ultimately, Lee — who cast her ballot along with more than 29 million others around the country — said she did so because it’s her duty as a citizen. Voting is a right that Koreans obtained only in 1948, which is why she considers it so important to voice her opinion through elections.

“We need to come together for the best of our country — especially during times like this,” she said.

https://www.vox.com/,"The economy is in free fall.

About 22 million people — or more than 13 percent of the US labor force — have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks. Economists are projecting unemployment as high as 20 percent within a matter of months. Entire industries, like hotels and airlines, have all but shut down, and the rest of the economy is slowing as people stay indoors and the panic from the coronavirus shock turns into an ongoing recession.

When the economy is collapsing like this, there’s an actor who is supposed to step in: the Federal Reserve.

While Congress occasionally steps in to offer stimulus through tax and spending programs (and it has, though it can do much more), the primary duty of preventing and mitigating recessions in the US rests with the Federal Reserve, which is obligated under federal law to minimize unemployment.

The Fed hasn’t always lived up to that mandate. Despite taking extreme, at times heroic measures to rescue the economy in 2008-’09, the Fed still oversaw a prolonged, painfully slow recovery that took a decade or more to reach full employment again. It continually undershot its inflation target, even as people were suffering from mass joblessness.

To its considerable credit, today’s Fed has been taking aggressive steps to fulfill its mandate, even bigger steps than the financial crisis-era Fed did. Fed Chair Jay Powell has committed trillions of dollars of Fed purchases to combating the coronavirus downturn and making sure businesses have easy access to credit. He has brought interest rates down to zero and taken the unprecedented step of subsidizing state and local governments by buying their bonds.

But while it’s become common to argue that the Fed is “out of bullets” since it’s done so much, nothing could be further from the truth. There’s still more the Fed can and should do to end this recession. Here’s what it has done so far, and what work it can still do to ease the suffering of millions of Americans.

The Fed’s actions to date, summarized

Cut rates to zero

On March 15, the Fed announced that it would cut its target interest rate to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent, returning rates to the record lows they reached during the 2008-’09 recession and its aftermath.

The Fed funds rate (often colloquially called the “Fed rate” or even just the “interest rate,” given its economy-wide effects) is the primary mechanism through which the Fed influences the American economy. When the Fed uses its powers to lower the rate, that means borrowing is cheaper: Mortgage rates fall, APRs for credit cards fall, auto loans get cheaper, etc. This is meant to stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.

The Fed enforces this target both through expectations (it’s powerful enough that just saying “we’re lowering rates” causes banks and other actors to follow suit) and through “open market operations,” in which it buys up Treasury bonds with money it creates in a bid to make those bonds’ interest rates fall to its target range. (For more, see Matt Yglesias’s explainer.)

The March 15 action was actually the second move the Fed made on interest rates in response to coronavirus. On March 3, the board slashed rates from a 1.5 to 1.75 percent range to 1 to 1.25 percent, a half-point cut. Now that rates are down to 0 to 0.25 percent, there’s nowhere left to go except negative. The Fed hasn’t done that before, but it could; see more below.

Unlimited quantitative easing

The Fed hit the zero lower bound pretty quickly in the financial crisis of 2008-’09. Once it did, it moved from trying to manipulate short-run interest rates (like the federal funds rate) to long-run interest rates, like the interest paid on 10-year US Treasury bonds. Normally it does this through “quantitative easing” — just buying up massive quantities of bonds, in particular US government bonds and mortgage bonds from Fannie and Freddie. Historically the Fed has committed to buying a specific amount of bonds, either one time or every month or quarter. Its coronavirus response started that way, with $500 billion in government bond buys and $200 billion of mortgage bond buys.

Then on March 23, it announced that quantitative easing would be unlimited. The Fed declared that it would “purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” It also expanded what bonds it bought to include commercial real estate, not just home mortgages.

This was a major escalation from previous QE efforts because it assured markets that the Fed would keep acting indefinitely to keep long-term rates low. Uncertainty about whether QE will abruptly end, or fall short of what’s necessary, could harm the recovery, so the Fed tried to eliminate that uncertainty entirely.

Skeptics of QE argue that it hurts savers (like pension firms) at the expense of people with debts. That’s part of the point, to help people get out from under debt incurred during the recession and to encourage people and businesses to take out more debt. But it provoked some political backlash.

Buying up corporate bonds

The same day that the Fed announced unlimited QE, it also announced the creation of a variety of programs to buy up bonds not covered by the QE program. Those include new and old corporate bonds and bonds backed by consumer debt other than mortgages (student loans, auto loans, credit card loans). It also announced it would set up a “Main Street Business Lending Program” to facilitate lending to small businesses.

These programs ensure that interest rates on these kinds of loans to individuals and businesses don’t get too high and that there’s a market to buy them. That way, banks have an incentive to keep issuing loans, knowing the Fed at least could buy them.

“Traditional logic would say that actions in the corporate bond market (which is tapped by bigger businesses) should trickle down to small businesses and consumer credit,” Yglesias explained when these moves were announced. “But today’s Fed isn’t taking chances. … All kinds of loans — federal government debt, consumer debt, corporate debt, mortgage debt, commercial real estate debt, and small business debt — are going to get help.”

Later, on April 9, the Fed announced various moves to strengthen these efforts to buy up different types of debt. It offered new loans to small businesses participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, committed to buying as much as $600 billion in loans from small businesses, and expanded the size or scope of the corporate and consumer bond purchase facilities. It also …

Buying state and local bonds

… set up a $500 billion fund to buy bonds from state governments and a few large local ones, which are seeing tax revenues collapse and are much more constrained than the federal government when it comes to spending. Buying up the bonds cheap helps stabilize the municipal bond market and makes it more affordable for states and cities to take out loans now to cover pandemic expenses.

In total, the April 9 actions added $2.3 trillion to the Fed’s purchasing efforts.

Options still on the table

Negative interest rates

The Fed has set interest rates at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent. This means it’s hit the “zero lower bound” — it can’t cut interest rates any further without going negative.

That said, it can go negative. The European Central Bank has been experimenting with modestly negative interest rates since June 2014, and the Bank of Japan has since January 2016. The Fed has never done the same, but these are not normal times.

Under a negative rate system, investors have to actually pay borrowers to take their money — that is, it would actually cost you to put money in the bank. The idea is that this would push you to spend your money instead of parking it in your account.

The ECB rate is only -0.5 percent, a very small cost to most depositors. But if rates get too negative, there’s a risk that businesses and individuals will start pulling their money from banks entirely and holding cash; if your checking account is losing, say, 5 percent of its value a year, there’s a good case for taking your money out and stuffing it under a mattress.

There are ways to get around that, though. Harvard economist Greg Mankiw has suggested that the Fed could declare all paper money with a serial number ending in “0” invalid, effective a year from now. That sets up an effective rate of negative 10 percent, so if the Fed sets a rate of, say, negative 6 percent on money still in the bank, that’s still an incredibly appealing proposition compared to getting a tenth of your cash wiped out.

Miles Kimball at the University of Colorado has proposed a similar system wherein the Fed would set up an “exchange rate” between paper and electronic money, so that when you deposit $100 in cash, less than $100 is added to your bank balance. That would similarly enable negative rates and limit the incentive to hoard cash, since it can’t be deposited and used to pay checks, credit card bills, etc., and most people have bills they can’t pay in cash.

Explicitly set government bond rates

One idea publicly floated by now-Deputy Fed Chair Richard Clarida would be to take quantitative easing a step further and commit to buying up US government bonds until rates on long-term (10- and 30-year) bonds hit an explicit target — say, 0 percent.

This would have several benefits. One, it would provide some focus for the Fed’s commitment to unlimited quantitative easing by making it clear what the goal of that measure is. The Fed is clear that it wants to lower long-term interest rates, but not what it wants to lower them to, and clarifying that in terms of government bonds could give quantitative easing more power and make it more effective in lowering those rates and making it cheaper for individuals and businesses to take out long-term loans.

Second, it would help Congress in developing their own response. Mandating that government bond rates are 0 or negative in inflation-adjusted terms would give Congress a guarantee that it can cut taxes and boost spending as much as necessary to fight the downturn, without risking runaway debt; it would be free or cheaper than free to borrow.

Target levels, not rates

Currently the Fed targets a given rate of inflation — 2 percent per year, for instance. What it tries to communicate to markets is that if inflation goes above that rate, it will take action to contain it, and conversely that if inflation falls below that rate, it will take action to increase it.

The problem has been that the Fed’s obedience to this target has been asymmetrical. Inflation has undershot the Fed’s target for well over a decade now:

The Fed not only hasn’t been able to get it much higher but also hasn’t tried to get prices of goods and services to where they would have been if the US had had steady 2 percent inflation every year from, say, 2008 to present.

Many economists have called for the Fed, in response to this failure, to adopt “level targeting” — not simply trying to hit a given rate of inflation, but trying to get consumer prices to where they ought to have been if inflation had hit the Fed’s target every single year. That means committing to aggressive action, and several years of above-trend inflation (say, 4 or 5 percent annually), to get back on track.

This suggestion is often paired with a proposal to move from targeting inflation to targeting nominal GDP — the size of the economy, not adjusting for inflation. The hope is that NGDP reflects both the rate of inflation and the underlying state of the economy, and targeting it could force the Fed to be more aggressive when economic growth is lagging and unemployment is rising. The Fed has a statutory duty to minimize both unemployment and inflation, and NGDP offers one way to do that.

Let low-income countries print dollars

One of the Fed’s less recognized policy tools is “swap lines”: defined arrangements that let other countries trade their currencies for dollars. The idea is that the dollar is a stable global reserve currency, whereas other countries’ currencies tend to be less stable, creating risk around exchange rates that can deter investment, especially in developing countries. Expanding access to credit in dollars can thus help safeguard other countries’ economies.

The Fed has long had these in operation with rich countries like the UK, Canada, and those represented by the European Central Bank, but recently expanded them to include a few emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil. Expanding to even more developing countries could help them recover.

Helicopter money, or printing money and giving it to people

Perhaps the most straightforward way for the Fed to help the economy would be to put money directly in people’s hands by printing it and mailing out checks.

It’s doubtful the Fed can do this under current statutory authority, but some in Congress have argued for giving it that authority. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) has proposed $2,000-per-month checks to adults and $1,000-per-month checks to children funded by printing money. A simpler idea would be to simply let the Fed send out checks the same way that Congress did through its recent $1,200 check initiative.

Helicopter drops have a long and distinguished history as a monetary policy idea; Ben Bernanke, for instance, has argued they have a place in the policy toolkit. The Fed has traditionally shied away because it views giving money to people as the domain of fiscal policy and thus of Congress. Congress could remove that hesitation by explicitly authorizing the Fed to drop helicopter money. The Bank of England is already doing something like this by directly funding government operations via printing money, so the Fed would be in good company.

Buy corporate stocks

The Fed has supported corporations by backstopping the corporate bond market and ensuring that short- and long-term interest rates remain low. But there are other actions it could take as well, though they would potentially require authorization from Congress.

The most straightforward option would be to buy corporate stocks, the way the Bank of Japan has done in recent years. That not only helps stabilize the stock market directly, it enables the Fed to set up a sovereign wealth fund invested in the US economy whose profits it can refund to the Treasury. That effectively provides a way to finance federal spending besides taxes and debt, which can be helpful if we need more fiscal stimulus in the future.

https://www.vox.com/,"On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s (R) office released a letter arguing that a Texas law governing who may obtain an absentee ballot must be read very narrowly — so narrowly that it could potentially disenfranchise millions of voters during the coronavirus pandemic.

The letter went even further than that, threatening criminal prosecutions against activists who encourage many younger voters to vote absentee.

The next day, a state trial judge in Austin rejected Paxton’s reading of this absentee ballot law, holding that Texas voters should have broad access to absentee ballots during the pandemic. But it is far from clear that Judge Tim Sulak’s order will survive contact with higher Texas courts.

That case is called Texas Democratic Party v. Debeauvoir.

All nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court are Republicans, so there is a very high likelihood that Paxton’s narrow reading of the law will prevail if Texas Democratic Party reaches the state supreme court. Paxton is widely expected to appeal Judge Sulak’s decision.

Texas is one of a minority of states that does not permit voters to obtain an absentee ballot for any reason they choose. In Texas, voters over the age of 65 may obtain such a ballot merely by requesting one, but younger voters may only obtain an absentee ballot under a limited set of circumstances.

The law does permit voters under the age of 65 to obtain an absentee ballot if they have a “sickness or physical condition,” but Paxton’s office claims that voters under the age of 65 have to actually be ill in order to obtain a ballot. As they read the law, it’s not enough if a voter is stuck at home in order to avoid becoming infected.

Because older voters tend to favor Republican candidates, Texas’s odd legal regime, where older voters may have an easy time voting from home while younger voters could struggle to obtain a ballot, could provide a significant unfair advantage to Republicans if the coronavirus pandemic still requires most Texans to remain at home on Election Day.

Moreover, the Texas law can plausibly be read in one of two ways — meaning that the Republican-controlled state supreme court could easily choose the reading that is best for the GOP.

Texas’s law is ambiguous

The specific law at issue in the Texas Democratic Party case provides that “a qualified voter is eligible for early voting by mail if the voter has a sickness or physical condition that prevents the voter from appearing at the polling place on Election Day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring the voter’s health.” The case turns on the proper reading of the words “physical condition.”

A team of civil rights lawyers led by the ACLU proposed reading this law broadly in a brief filed in the Texas Democratic Party case. They argue that the words “physical condition” include the physical condition of being susceptible to the coronavirus. Thus, during a pandemic that requires massive social distancing to control infections, everyone has a “physical condition” that should enable them to obtain an absentee ballot.

Paxton’s office, meanwhile, argues in a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Ryan Vassar, that “a reasonable fear of contracting the virus” is not a legitimate reason to receive an absentee ballot because “an individual’s fear of contracting COVID-19” is merely a “mental” condition — not a “physical” one.

Vassar’s argument rests on a false distinction, and it is not an especially plausible way of reading the state law: The same person can simultaneously have the physical condition of being susceptible to the coronavirus and the mental condition of being afraid of contracting the coronavirus.

That said, there is a more plausible way to read the statute narrowly. Because the words “physical condition” appear in conjunction with the word “sickness,” and because the statute states elsewhere that this provision deals with cases of “disability,” a judge could rule that the words “physical condition” are meant to refer to a disabling condition that is not shared by the public at large. Often, when a law uses a general term in the context of other, more specific terms, courts will assume that the general term should be given a narrow reading — one similar to the specific terms.

Given that this statute could fairly be interpreted in one of two ways, there’s a very good reason for courts to choose the more expansive reading. The right to vote, the US Supreme Court recognized more than a century ago, “is regarded as a fundamental political right” because it is “preservative of all rights.” Often, when there are two plausible ways to read a statute and one of those readings undermines a fundamental constitutional right, courts will choose the reading that leaves that right intact.

But it is far from clear that the Texas Supreme Court, with its entirely Republican membership, will choose to uphold voting rights here.

Paxton is determined to attack the right to vote

Texas’s attorney general, meanwhile, appears determined to fight for a narrow reading of the state’s absentee voting law. In a statement released shortly after Judge Sulak’s decision, Paxton claimed that “this unlawful expansion of mail-in voting will only serve to undermine the security and integrity of our elections and to facilitate fraud.”

In reality, however, the overwhelming majority of states permit voters to obtain an absentee ballot without having to justify that request. Only seven states — Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and South Carolina — have laws restricting access to absentee ballots for people under a certain age, according to the advocacy group Vote at Home.

So Paxton is effectively arguing that the legal regime that exists in the vast majority of states is a threat to election security and an invitation to fraud.

And Paxton isn’t simply relying on phantom fears of voter fraud. Vassar’s letter — the one offering the attorney general’s office’s idiosyncratic reading of the state law — also claims that “to the extent third parties advise voters to apply for a mail-in ballot based solely on fear of contracting COVID-19, such activity could subject those third parties to criminal sanctions.” The attorney general’s office, in other words, appears to be threatening criminal prosecutions against any organization that encourages healthy voters to seek an absentee ballot.

In the likely event that Paxton prevails before Texas’s Republican Supreme Court, moreover, the stakes are simply enormous. If voters remain on lockdown this November, millions of Texans could be disenfranchised if they cannot obtain absentee ballots.

https://www.vox.com/,"I tried to write an essay about productivity in quarantine. It took me a month to do it.

Share All sharing options for: I tried to write an essay about productivity in quarantine. It took me a month to do it.

In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when it was just beginning to become clear that people who could stay at home would be doing so for a very long while, an argument began to emerge. It mostly played out on social media, but after a while it moved to news outlets, too: the New York Times, HuffPost, Forbes. It concerned working at home, because it is disproportionately easy for people like me who work in digital media to work at home, and the question it revolved around was: Is a pandemic the time to get extremely productive? Or is it the time to take a break?

First, there was the King Lear argument. Shakespeare, as people reminded each other, wrote King Lear when he was quarantined during a plague. And it soon became clear that Shakespeare was just one of the many geniuses of history who accomplished miraculous things while confined to his house. Sir Isaac Newton discovered the laws of gravity and invented calculus under quarantine. Mary Shelley, well, was not under quarantine when she wrote Frankenstein and invented science fiction, but she was at least cooped up in the house because of the year without summer, so truly, can’t she serve as an inspirational figure as well? After a period, it began to seem somewhat astonishing that anyone ever managed to accomplish anything without some global catastrophe confining them to their home.

Just a reminder that when Shakespeare was quarantined because of the plague, he wrote King Lear. — rosanne cash (@rosannecash) March 14, 2020

And then, inevitably, came the whispered implication: Shouldn’t you yourself be using this time at home — dare we say this gift — because you are at home and not working in an essential field? Shouldn’t you be using this time to become more productive? Shouldn’t you be buckling down and writing a masterpiece or inventing a genre or discovering fundamental laws of the universe? At the very least, shouldn’t you be taking up a new hobby, mastering a skill, or perhaps be reaching your fully fledged form as what Forbes termed a “coronapreneur?”

But then came the backlash. The push to be productive while sheltering in place during a once-a-century global catastrophe was the latest sign, critics argued, of capitalism corrupting our minds.

“Please don’t be guilted into being more productive during the coronavirus,” wrote Monica Torres at HuffPost.

“This mindset is the natural endpoint of America’s hustle culture — the idea that every nanosecond of our lives must be commodified and pointed toward profit and self-improvement,” wrote Nick Martin at the New Republic.

“I, too, am declining to write the next King Lear as protest against capitalism,” proclaimed Rosa Lyster at the Outline.

Since Lyster’s March 18 article, the Outline’s staff has been entirely laid off as a result of the pandemic’s toll on the economy. While I was working on this article, CNBC reported that Vox Media, Vox’s parent company, was planning to furlough multiple employees. That’s another layer of this fight: Many of the people who are arguing over how productive anyone should be right now are doing so with the knowledge that layoffs or furloughs or pay cuts are hanging over their heads. With that knowledge comes the whisper developing in the back of everyone’s minds that perhaps this is the time to get very productive indeed, because how else can they show their employer how valuable they are and ensure their continued employment?

Perhaps this is also the time to make our off hours very productive, because you never know when you’ll need a new hobby you can turn into a side hustle. At the very least, staying busy and using your time meaningfully will be the virtuous thing to do, and it will keep your mind off everything else that is happening ... right?

Unless that line of thought is yet another sign of capitalism getting into our heads, and we really need to process and mourn and deal with the overwhelming and exhausting anxiety of living through a once-a-century pandemic. Maybe?

In the end, it all boils down to one question: Under these very peculiar circumstances, should we be trying to be productive?

Time-oriented productivity was invented by industrial capitalism

The idea of productivity as we currently understand it — doing as much as possible, as efficiently as possible — is a product of industrial capitalism. In non-industrialized societies, human beings tend to organize their sense of time around how long it takes to complete certain tasks, measuring time not by hours but by how long it takes to boil a pot of rice, for instance. And instead of keeping to a strict work schedule from 9 am to 5 pm and reserving the rest of their lives for leisure, people in non-industrial societies tend not to establish strict divisions between their working lives and the rest of their lives.

Instead, they work on a task for as long as it takes to do it, with plenty of rest mixed in. Often they fall into what we might call the college student work system: long periods of idleness, and then sprees of frantic work as a deadline approaches (think harvest time, market time, or other similar markers). This way of thinking about work is called task-orientation.

As the West industrialized over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the rising capitalist bourgeoisie developed new ways of thinking about time, which, in turn, it passed on to the working class. A factory’s machines must be turned on at the same time every day, and so workers, it followed, must be at their posts at the same time every day. And as factory work became more common, workers learned to think of part of their time as their own, and part of it as belonging to the people they worked for. To the capitalist, time is money, and specifically, the worker’s time is the employer’s money.

To the capitalist, time is money, and specifically the worker’s time is the employer’s money

But the great switch from task-orientation to time-orientation did not happen overnight. It took centuries of social conditioning and moralizing, centuries of discussion of the importance of punctuality and the wickedness of idleness.

Moralizers wrote adages about how Satan finds work for idle hands. Factories instituted harsh punishments against lateness and loitering. Schools were designed to teach students that their time was not their own: If schools could manage to give poor students activities to work on for at least 12 hours a day, declared Bishop William Turner in 1770, “we hope that the rising generation will be so habituated to constant employment that it would at length prove agreeable and entertaining to them.” And over time, young children could become “habituated, not to say naturalized to Labour and Fatigue,” wrote the reformer John Powell in 1772.

The economist E.P. Thompson developed the ideas and examples I’ve outlined here in his classic 1967 essay, “Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism,” which examines England’s shift from task-orientation to time-orientation. Thompson argued that as capitalism and Puritanism rose together in the West, the pair taught human beings a different relationship to time from the one they had before: one in which time had a value, in which it was literally equivalent to money. And for Thompson in 1967, the rise of task-orientation prompted a new question: How were capitalist human beings going to handle leisure time?

“If Puritanism was a necessary part of the work-ethos which enabled the industrialized world to break out of the poverty-stricken economies of the past,” Thompson wrote, “will the Puritan value of time begin to decompose as the pressures of poverty relax?”

Put differently: Now that more people are living out of poverty than ever before, now that we have, once again, the concept of leisure time, is it possible for us to break away from the idea that productivity is a moral good and idleness evil?

In the 21st century, people work even when they’re not supposed to be

In the US, it looks as though the answer to Thompson’s question is no. Americans are not learning to treat productivity as anything but a moral good, or idleness as anything but wicked. Many people spend their time working, even when they are ostensibly off work. Even rich American men — theoretically the people with the opportunity for the most leisure time, since they have plenty of money and fewer household obligations than women do — spend more time working than their peers in other countries. One economist postulated to the Atlantic in 2016 that wealthy American men, like the children William Turner wanted to educate in the 18th century, are so habituated to the accumulation of wealth that they treat it as a form of recreation: It’s the closest thing they have to fun.

But even those of us who are not wealthy and who are not men spend most of our time working. This is especially true for millennials. As BuzzFeed News’s Anne Helen Petersen pointed out in her viral 2019 essay on millennial burnout, the youth of today’s workforce spent their childhoods optimizing to become more effective workers, only to graduate into a job market that had been decimated by the 2008 recession. Raised to be problem solvers, millennials like me responded by optimizing ourselves en masse, becoming ever more efficient and ever more committed to their work, while that work, in turn, seeped invisibly into even more corners of their lives, carried by smartphones and push alerts and long hours at the office.

But that constant work, which was supposed to bring millennials a measure of the job security our parents took for granted, was unsuccessful.

“The more work we do, the more efficient we’ve proven ourselves to be, the worse our jobs become,” Petersen wrote: “lower pay, worse benefits, less job security. Our efficiency hasn’t bucked wage stagnation; our steadfastness hasn’t made us more valuable. If anything, our commitment to work, no matter how exploitative, has simply encouraged and facilitated our exploitation. We put up with companies treating us poorly because we don’t see another option. We don’t quit. We internalize that we’re not striving hard enough. And we get a second gig.”

We have become a society in which people feel constant pressure to work and to be productive, even when we are theoretically resting. And that’s under normal circumstances.

Millennials work; they cobble together side hustles and temporary jobs into something approaching a living wage; they post the result on social media for their friends to admire. But then social media, too, becomes a form of work, a place on which millennials are reminded that they must always continue optimizing their lives for clicks. Marie Kondo your home, cook your Alison Roman shallot pasta, organize your books by color, and post a picture of the shelf on Instagram.

We spend our time locked into the endless, infinite scroll of Twitter and Tumblr and Facebook and Instagram, all of which reward constant immersion and monitoring until they begin to feel like duties rather than products to use for fun. We listen to podcasts and audiobooks at 1.5 speed to consume them more efficiently; Netflix floated the idea of letting us speed up our binge-watches, too. We consult lists of the TV shows we must watch and the books we must read which come, over time, to look more and more like homework. Leisure today is not truly leisure; it is labor.

We have become a society in which people feel constant pressure to work and to be productive, even when they are theoretically resting. And that’s under normal circumstances.

So what happens during a pandemic?

It took me almost a month to write this essay. But I wanted desperately to produce something for that entire month.

My editor assigned this essay to me on March 19. “People keep talking about King Lear,” she said. “Could you write something about that?”

“No problem,” I said. I started a file labeled “You don’t have to write King Lear,” and then instead of writing anything in it I sat and stared at it for some time. Then I opened Twitter in another tab.

My mind felt as though it had been shattered. I couldn’t sustain a thought long enough to analyze anything. I just stared in a blank fury at that Rosanne Cash tweet reminding me that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during quarantine.

“What a stupid thing to say,” I thought. “We’re already dealing with a global emergency and now I’m supposed to write King Lear on top of that? Well, fuck you.”

Rosanne Cash was probably not trying to pressure anyone into writing King Lear. Probably she was just trying to remind us that great art can come out of very dark times, and that this too shall pass, and perhaps when it is over, it will have given us some great artistic gift. But I was in no place to think of her tweet that way.

Like nearly everyone else who is living through this, I was grieving. The world was a certain way, and then the pandemic came and changed things, and now that old world will never come back in quite the same way again: It’s dead. That’s a loss, and one we have to work through.

I was also angry. I am still angry. I am furious at the leadership in our government that has abdicated responsibility for handling this crisis. I’m furious that essential workers are putting their lives on the line without medical-grade protection. Looking at one industry and one city alone, at least 62 New York City transit workers are dead and over 6,000 more are in quarantine with suspected Covid-19 after management told them not to wear masks on the subway to prevent customers from panicking. How can anyone not be angry and afraid and sad right now? And how can anyone do meaningful work under those conditions?

I am also living through my second major financial crisis as a working adult at age 31. Those first few weeks, whenever I wasn’t listening to the sirens outside my apartment or trying to figure out safe ways to see my 72-year-old parents again, I was thinking about all the reports that said that traffic throughout digital media was high, but ad revenue was way down; reports that showed layoffs and pay cuts and furloughs spreading through one media company after another.

I am a good well-behaved, high-achieving millennial. Every instinct I had said that now was the time to buckle down and put myself to work, to try to outwork whatever would come. But I couldn’t sustain a thought long enough to work on long-form analysis.

Still, I wanted to lose myself in a project, something I could finish, something that would give me a sense that I had produced something — and that I had thus been virtuous. I baked bread, and then bread pudding. I sewed masks. I started an advice column. I started a book club.

I felt like I still wasn’t being productive enough. I felt like I couldn’t ever be productive enough. The thought of this unfinished essay assignment haunted me every time I sat down to work.

“The thing is,” I told myself every time I looked at the empty file, “the thesis of this hypothetical piece is that capitalism is fake and you don’t actually have to be productive during a global crisis. So, capitalism is fake. Don’t be productive.”

I wanted to produce something, and I couldn’t do it, and the failure felt monumental

But the thought felt like cheating. It felt lazy and hackneyed. All I wanted was to produce something, and I knew where the desire came from, what historical and economic factors lent it moral weight and what quirks of my own brain chemistry made me internalize them so completely, but that didn’t make the desire less real. I wanted to produce something, and I couldn’t do it, and the failure felt monumental.

Eventually, I pulled myself together enough to be able to hold a thought in my head. I put this essay together, section by section, and the work felt soothing.

But I don’t have a good answer to the question of how hard you should be working or how productive you should be during a pandemic. We’re in a global crisis, and if we are extremely lucky, we’re sitting in our homes and trying to work through it. Taking on big and absorbing projects might be soothing right now, because we have been taught to experience labor as soothing and this is not the ideal moment to start deprogramming capitalism from our brains. But it also might feel impossible to take on any additional labor right now, because dealing with the loss we’re feeling is monumental enough.

Those are both perfectly reasonable, understandable reactions. Be kind to yourself. Do what feels good to you, and what you have to do to make it through this.

You don’t have to sit around and do nothing if the idea is scary to you. But also: You really don’t have to write King Lear.

https://www.vox.com/,"Day after day, Deanna Miller Berry watches the requests pile up in her inbox.

“Please help me,” a resident of Denmark, South Carolina, pleads. “I’m stuck in my house and don’t want to drink the water.”

“Just water,” another resident writes in.

A third request for water comes in from a family of two who live in an apartment in the center of town on a block flanked by Baptist churches and not too far from the Piggly Wiggly. Miller Berry logs the responses to the dozen questions in an Excel sheet for the Denmark Citizens for Clean Water: Yes, someone in the home is directly impacted by Covid-19. Yes, someone has a disability. Yes, someone is elderly. No, neither one has access to their own transport.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Miller Berry’s document keeps growing longer. As the founder of Denmark Citizens for Clean Water, she helps supply the community with clean water instead of the brown, smelly liquid that has been sloshing out of the taps in a number of homes for more than a decade. She delivers tanks and pays the monthly water costs — sometimes hundreds of dollars — for residents in the majority-black community.

The town’s battle with drinking water — laced with HaloSan, a pesticide meant to kill bacteria — long precedes the pandemic, though. Residents told a local outlet 10 years ago, “The smell is terrible.” More recently, former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer mentioned the residents’ concerns over their water system on the campaign trail.

Virginia Tech civil engineering professor Marc Edwards, who exposed the unsafe lead levels in the water in Flint, Michigan, and helped bring national attention to the issue, has also gone down to Denmark to test the town’s well at the request of the community. In 2017, he collected dozens of samples from homes, Miller Berry says, but when Edwards asked the town’s mayor if he could test a well for possible bacterial contamination after spotting a leaky sewage pipe, the mayor refused.

As for Flint, Mayor Sheldon Neely is still busy dealing with the community’s access to clean drinking water six years after large amounts of lead were detected. And now there is the pandemic. When Vox spoke with Neely a few weeks ago, he had declared a state of emergency before the president of the United States had, and had ordered water that was shut off by the previous administration reconnected.

Meanwhile, miles away in Detroit, lawyers and activists are also fighting to turn water back on for the city’s most vulnerable populations, after officials promised it would do so amid coronavirus concerns — yet hundreds still remain without access.

Having chemical- and lead-free water — or water at all — in the pandemic is vital: Hand-washing with soap is one of the most effective ways to fight off the virus. But millions of Americans across the country lack clean water — from small, rural towns in Kentucky to New Jersey’s densely populated city of Newark. And while clean water access isn’t only an issue for majority-black communities like Flint, Denmark, or Detroit, one study did find race to be the strongest correlative to lack of clean water. It is a crisis that is further exacerbated by the coronavirus, compounding years-long injustices in water-poor communities.

“It’s just a Catch-22,” Edwards tells Vox. “If [these communities] don’t engage in rigorous hygiene, they’re endangering themselves to coronavirus, and if they do, they’re fearful of the water.”

Communities without access to clean water are in a “constant state of emergency”

Contaminated water isn’t confined to a few communities or states, experts say. In any given year from 1982 to 2015, nearly 45 million Americans were accessing water that violated health standards, according to a 2018 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

While that may be true, the lack of water access impacts low-income communities like Denmark, Flint, and Martin County, Kentucky, more aggressively.

“That is a reality for our poorest Americans,” Edwards said, which “translates into a lot of problems. ... Cities that have a lot of water shutoffs. Others are living in fear of bathing and showering because of distrust in their water. And so even the basic functional water and quantity for hygiene isn’t being delivered.”

In Martin County, Kentucky, BarbiAnn Maynard, who has seen brown, milky water in her shower and kitchen for nearly two decades — when she does have water — waves off the collective panic around coronavirus.

“This is not anything unusual for us,” Maynard, a member of the Martin County Water Warriors, tells Vox. “I used hand sanitizer rather than our water” before coronavirus. She has been afraid to wash her hands for a long time, and the pandemic has changed almost nothing, she says. When she takes a shower, she uses antibacterial hand-wash.

The Martin County Water District operates in a “constant state of emergency,” the state’s Public Service Commission noted. A 2019 report from the Appalachian Citizens Law Center noted nearly half of the county’s residents couldn’t afford to buy water regularly. (The water department did not return Vox’s request for comment.)

Now in the pandemic, many of the grocery stores in the county are out of water, Maynard says. Donors paying into a fund for residents to buy water are still making contributions, but the only grocery store allowing residents to buy water at market value limits it to two gallons per person per visit. It takes an average of four gallons to get through the day, Maynard says. Before the pandemic, residents could make a 45-minute drive to a spring in West Virginia, but now they’re not allowed to cross state lines.

To work around the grocery stores’ rules, Maynard went directly to the bottle distribution center in Elkhorn City, Kentucky, more than an hour drive from her home, to buy cases in bulk.

But even before the coronavirus, Martin County needed more bottled and distilled water than other places in the US. “It’s just as bad inhaling it in the shower, so you have to get right back out,” Maynard says.

The threat of dirty, lead-infused, or chemical-laced water — and, in some cases, no water at all — is not only a rural concern. Last year, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off in the city of Detroit, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31 had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report).

Kristi Pullen Fedinick, the director of science and data at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, attributes the overlooked water crises across the country to governmental “policies that have led to specific communities being disenfranchised and marginalized.”

These dozens of communities across the United States, she says, have been facing not only water crises but many other issues because they have been systematically ignored for decades by those in charge. She ticks off the problems communities tend to face when they lack water: poor air quality, poor access to health care, and higher-than-average death rates. “The pandemic really exacerbated those issues they have been facing for a very, very, very long time.”

In Newark, New Jersey, for example, the state’s largest city, lead-contaminated water has impacted the health of its residents for years, with city officials denying there was a problem. In 2018, they abruptly changed course, however, and started handing out water filters to some residents after a new study confirmed that lead was indeed in the water at an alarmingly high rate, the New York Times reported. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to the mayor recommending the city advise residents “to use bottled water for drinking and cooking, until we can be assured of the reliable efficacy of filtration devices.” At the same time, the Newark Water Coalition provided hundreds of gallons of water and filters at its distribution sites pre-pandemic, to fill in the void of just how much water residents need.

But with the stay-at-home mandates in a hot spot like New Jersey, the coalition’s co-founder Sabre Bee says getting water out to those in need isn’t always possible when keeping social distancing in mind.

“We were doing [distribution] at church, but of course, we can’t gather in groups of five or more,” Bee says. “And so we haven’t been able to move distributions.” Instead, she and other advocates for clean water deliver water to older and ill people, those who cannot get around in the middle of a pandemic.

People are telling Bee they’re boiling water when they can’t get clean water, which she knows works with bacteria. But with lead, she says, that only concentrates the amount in the water.

“I know this is serious,” Bee says about the pandemic, “and I have to help my immune system during this time, but I’m drinking water that’s poisoned. So now I’m just a ball of nerves and feeling helpless and hopeless.”

Local water advocacy groups are stepping in to bring water to their communities

In 2018, the NRDC found that more than 30 million Americans, nearly 10 percent of the country’s population, drank from sources that violated the EPA’s federal regulations. The issue, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlines on its website, is that even though the EPA puts out regulations — like setting legal limits on contaminants in drinking water and regularly updating water standards — they are just regulations. There is no national standard that mandates states implement the EPA’s guidelines. This leaves a gap in local and state governments carrying out these guidelines, because in many cases, they may not have the financial resources to improve their drinking water.

“I’m just a ball of nerves and feeling helpless and hopeless”

As Edwards says, all the blame cannot be placed on small, local governments: “Many of our post-industrial cities and towns in America are losing population, and those who are left behind cannot afford to upgrade their infrastructure and maintain it to meet existing federal laws and standards. And so [those in charge] end up cutting corners because they have no choice.”

This leaves those communities at risk to take it upon themselves to find — and many times buy — their own clean drinking water.

In Denmark, Miller Berry has taken on the burden of helping those in her community. “We’ve gotten zero help from the state of South Carolina. We’ve gotten zero help from our county, and we’ve gotten zero help from our city officials. We are being ignored by all three,” Miller Berry says. (Multiple attempts by Vox to contact the mayor’s office went unanswered.)

She has paid more than 20 residents’ water bills over the past few months, according to her calculations, and word is spreading. These days, she gets more than 60 calls a day.

“I’ve been reaching out to the National Guard today to see if they could provide a water buffalo [tank]. But a [tank] cannot be provided to us until our county emergency management manager declares Denmark an emergency,” Miller Berry says.

This is a stark contrast to local governments that have stepped up in the pandemic. In Newark, construction workers have replaced more than half of the nearly 19,000 lead-laden pipes since 2019, according to Kareem Adeem, the city’s director of water and sewage. Filters that should last the better part of a year were passed out before the coronavirus outbreak to the residents who still have lead-contaminated water in their pipes, he said.

In Kentucky, Maynard can’t even finish her sentence when she talks about how people are supporting her community. “Getting donations right now is, oh, my gosh,” she says over the phone with relief. A state representative sent 60 gallons of distilled water for medical needs, while another Democratic state Senate candidate, Scott Sykes, sent 200 cases of water to residents, she said.

Even though it’s a massive public health threat, coronavirus feels like a blip to communities struggling with water, Edwards says. “There [are] many dimensions to this problem and [coronavirus] is a minor dimension, but it’s symptomatic of a frustrating situation that you can’t even rely on to get water from your tap.”

https://www.vox.com/,"As coronavirus has shut down the United States, schools have had no choice but to close and move classes — or at least, some semblance of them — online. But some school services can’t be delivered remotely. You can’t serve lunch over Zoom.

For millions of American families, though, school meal programs are essential, the difference between fed kids and hungry ones. On a regular, non-pandemic school day, the National School Lunch Program provides free or low-cost meals to 29.7 million kids, while the School Breakfast Program reaches 14.6 million students daily. And as the people who work in school nutrition are acutely aware, with skyrocketing unemployment, the need is only going up. “We’ve already seen new applications coming in,” says Gay Anderson, child nutrition director for South Dakota’s Brandon Valley Schools and president of the School Nutrition Association.

In response, school nutrition programs have sprung into action, trying to figure out how to get food to the kids who depend on it without putting themselves — or the students — at risk. School feeding, which falls under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Agriculture, is a complicated operation on a good day; now, districts are scrambling to navigate this new reality.

What those efforts look like on the ground varies widely: Some districts are operating curbside grab-and-go operations daily; others are running twice-weekly delivery routes, with school buses ferrying meals instead of kids. Some communities haven’t been hit hard by the virus yet; others have had to temporarily suspend or scale back service as food service workers have fallen ill. Some are offering hazard pay to front-line workers, but many aren’t — there’s no federal funding allocated to improving labor conditions for essential staff.

The past few weeks have been “a big cyclone of worrying,” one cafeteria worker in Virginia told me. “Are the kids safe? Are we safe? Can we do this? Are they not going to get fed?” Then there’s an uncertain future to contend with: Districts are consumed with the challenge of feeding kids now, and at the same time, school nutrition directors are trying to figure out what to do about next year, bracing for higher food costs on even more limited budgets.

Over the past week, I’ve been talking to school nutrition directors and food service workers across the country about their programs and what their lives look like now. Our conversations have been condensed and edited for clarity.

Shayna Williams

Contract food service worker for Amity Regional School District, Connecticut

I’m a front-line worker. We’re still continuing to provide meals for the kids while they’re out of school in this crisis. I’m making 450 to 900 meals a day, depending on the request. Not only am I making meals for my school, but I’m making meals for other schools in the district, and we’re sending them off.

I’ve only been at this job since January. Before this started, I would come in around 9:30, prep for the meals, cash out all the students that come through for lunch, and then clean afterward. It wasn’t so stressful, and it wasn’t so scary.

Now we’re coming in at 6 am, maybe 6:30 am, every morning, and we’re working until maybe 1:30, 2 o’clock. We serve Monday through Friday from 10 am to 12 pm. They’re all cold meals. We probably do a turkey and cheese sandwich. Maybe chips and dip. Cereal, applesauce, carrots, celery, broccoli — anything that they need, we’re giving it to them as long as it’s healthy.

I’m grateful to even be at work still. A lot of people aren’t working, and unemployment checks haven’t hit a lot of people’s bank accounts yet. I’m grateful. But again, it’s scary. Right now, I’m making $17 an hour. We haven’t gotten any type of hazard pay. We’re working on it, but we haven’t heard anything back yet. I’m hoping for the best.

I don’t feel safe because I think that we need PPE. It’s very important. We need necessities that will protect us. We all have gloves they give us, but we bring masks. I brought my own, and then the next day, everybody wore masks. They’re like, “Oh, my god, we can wear masks?” I’m like, “Yes! We have to wear masks! If you have to bring your own, bring your own.”

People are dying every day from this disease. So it’s like, am I at risk? Am I putting myself at risk? Yes. I’m a single mom. I’m afraid that if I bring it home to my daughter, god forbid something happens to her. So that’s my stress as well.

I miss seeing the kids. Because lunch people, lunch staff, food service workers — whatever you want to call us — we affect the students as well. You really watch them grow up. It’s like your own kid. I used to go to school just to eat lunch. I didn’t have food at home, so I know how much of an effect a school lunch person can have on a child. You never know what a kid is going through. When you see them and you smile, it matters. It means something to them. To this day, at 32 years old, it still means something to me when I see the lunch lady that used to give me food when I didn’t have food. She took care of me. She’s a good person. I try to be that role model for the kids when they come through my line.

Brook Brubeck

Food services director for Prairie Hills Unified School District, Kansas

It was a no-brainer that we would move into emergency feeding, so in mid-March I started gathering information to see what I needed to do to make that happen. That essentially meant Googling “emergency closure feeding for school nutrition” and reading different articles about what schools had done during natural disasters and what schools on the East and West coasts were doing.

I knew I wanted to provide lunch for sure, breakfast if it was possible. We started getting news that the USDA was going to loosen guidelines and allow us more flexibility in where and how we could feed kids during an emergency. We have a waiver that allows us to serve in areas that would not normally qualify, because the free and reduced percentages are not as high. We can treat it just like our summer food program, which is free for any child under 18. You don’t have to provide identification or anything like that. We don’t need to know if you’re a student. You just show up to the site and get a meal.

We have nine serving sites, and we have a home delivery route in our largest community — that’s considered the ninth site. It’s just me, driving my car.

When we first started, we relied heavily on prepackaged items that we could just throw in a bag. Uncrustables are huge. We serve lunch and breakfast at the same time, so tons of prepackaged mini pancakes and mini bagels with cream cheese. Precut apple slices. Baby carrots that are packaged. That allowed us to focus on the operation for a while rather than trying to focus on the food. We just set up an assembly line on the cafeteria tables so that we could spread out and just started bagging.

We’ve moved away from the prepackaged stuff because it isn’t available, we just can’t get it. So now we’re having to do things like cup our own fruit and bag our own vegetables, which is tedious. I’m usually in the kitchen by about 4:15 am, just getting stuff ready. Today for lunch we did a ham and cheesy ranch croissant. We’ve had to get very fancy with our bread choices because we can’t find anything else. We’ve joked that we were going to put it on our regular menu and label it the Corona Special.

The very first week, my cooks were also the meal service people. We learned quickly that that was not going to work. I realized if we had any chance at all of making this sustainable for any length of time that I needed to keep the people preparing the food as insulated as I possibly could.

I think the thing that surprised me the most has been the level of responsibility I feel. I want so much to make good decisions for my staff and for our communities, and it often feels like those are at odds. I feel like their lives are in my hands — in both cases, because I have definitely seen the need for our meals for families that are struggling. I also see the fear in my employees’ eyes.

Claine Raining bird

Assistant cook at a school on an American Indian reservation, Montana

We had to find a new system to serve the kids. We do hot meals. Comfort food. We did breakfast for lunch today — premade omelets, pancakes, sliced oranges, milk. Tomorrow’s going to be our Easter dinner. We normally do some scalloped potatoes, ham, fruit, and a dinner roll. We would serve this on trays; now it’s in a to-go box.

We have one central curbside pickup point at our main school — we’re pretty centrally located. It’s a half-mile walking distance in each direction. The town’s not very big. There are five different towns on this reservation. In other towns, the HPDP [Indian Health Service’s Health Promotion and Disease Prevention program] is doing meals. We have our own school, and that takes care of most of the feeding on this side of the reservation. Our food program and their program are two different things.

Certain items are backed up. Cleaning supplies, gloves. Bags of chips, now — the little 8-ounce bags. We’re serving about 500 meals a day, maybe 2,000 a week. We can pretty much figure out the patterns. Mondays are the busiest, and Fridays, because of the weekend. I’ve worked in all the schools, so I know the kids that need it, and I know the ones that will be all right. We’re in a part of the state where the poverty is pretty high, so over 60 percent of kids qualify for free and reduced lunch. Right now, we’re almost matching our normal numbers daily, so I know our district is doing pretty well.

Claine requested his school not be named in this article to protect student privacy.

Jessica Shelly

Director of student dining services for Cincinnati Public Schools, Ohio

I was actually in Washington, DC, on Capitol Hill about to talk to an Ohio senator about child nutrition programs when I got the call from my district that we were closing the schools because of a possible Covid-19 case and I should get on the first plane back to Cincinnati. This was March 10. Our schools didn’t actually close until March 16, but we started doing meals on that very next day, because we had spent so much time preplanning, getting deliveries in, figuring out our sites.

We’re a little different than most other districts, where they’re actually preparing meals in one of their school kitchens. Our district made the decision to close every single school building — they went in and did a massive cleaning of every single building and then sealed it so nobody can go in and possibly recontaminate it.

We’re working out of the test kitchen below our offices, so we’re capped at making 4,800 meals a day. I normally serve between 55,000 and 60,000 meals a day, but that can’t happen when all my schools are closed. What was imperative was our relationships with other community organizations, like UMC Food Ministry and Children’s Hunger Alliance, who were able to set up meal distribution at community centers — places of faith, YMCAs, Boys and Girls Clubs, libraries. With those partnerships, we were able to fill in gaps that we couldn’t do alone as a school district.

At some places, we are running out of food. That’s heartbreaking. We tell the kids, “Hold on, we’re going to get you something, just hold on.” Sometimes they’ll wait and sometimes they don’t. Other sites we just don’t have as much volume at, but we feel strongly about keeping those open because they’re in corners of our city that are very far away from the center. Our district is 92-square-miles large. It’s a very spread-out community.

Our projected loss — this is painful — from March 16 to May 22, which is the end of our school year, is $2.4 million. We only get reimbursement money when we serve a meal. I am greatly decreased in the number of meals I’m serving, which means the amount of money I have coming in is very, very small. But almost all my fixed costs stay the same. Salary, electricity, water, garbage: All that stays the same. It’s going to totally change how I look at what I can and cannot offer.

I’ve been doing a lot of policy and advocacy. I’m hoping the USDA reimburses districts for their fixed costs. That would help a lot. In Houston, after Hurricane Harvey, the USDA came through and said, “All kids eat for free for the next four years. Don’t worry about applications, don’t worry about paperwork. Don’t worry about administrative red tape. Feed the kids.”

I’m really hoping they’re going to look at the country and say, “You know what, there are so many families that have lost income, that are on unemployment, that are struggling. Across the country, the next four years, everybody eats for free. Feed the kids, feed the nation, support our future, and let them all eat free.” That’s my pie-in-the-sky ask.

Danielle Bock

Director of nutrition for Greeley-Evans Weld County School District 6, Colorado

We’d had a really bad outbreak of norovirus last spring break — when I say really bad, we shut down at least three of our elementary schools and our alternative high school for multiple days. So, luckily and coincidentally, we’d given ourselves a year to come up with a contagion plan. We actually did a district leadership training back in January. Have you ever done those hand-washing demos where you put glow-in-the-dark powder on your hands and then you go wash them under blacklight? We’d just done that with 200 of our district administrators. We had no idea about coronavirus at that point.

Thank god for the contagion plan, because at the very least it gave us a structure to think about this — what would it look like if one building was closed? What would it look like if all the buildings were closed? What it did not have were plans for a long-term closure. That was not something we had anticipated. But it came in very handy that Friday before spring break when we found ourselves sitting down to say, what does it look like if spring break is two weeks long? That was our original plan — we’re going to extend spring break a week and see if this blows over.

At first, we did drive-up distribution — stay in your car, ask how many kids are in your household — but there were way too many points of contact. It was taking three to four people per site, times 10 sites, plus drivers to deliver, plus people back at our production kitchen ... it was just too many people. The second week, we moved to a bus route distribution. The buses still stop at those 10 schools in the loading zones and hand out meals to families, and they also run routes through the neighborhood.

We went from serving one day of breakfast and lunch at a time to three days of breakfast and lunch at a time. On Wednesdays, we’ve added two parking lot distributions where families can drive up and get the meals, as well as food from our local food bank. On Thursday and Friday, when we do our route, we’re handing out what are called backpacks. They’re basically a weekend bag. A local nonprofit will purchase ready-to-eat and shelf-stable food — think Cup Noodles. Not super nutrient-dense, but it’s food, and it’s food that a person as young as second grade can put together themselves without assistance from an adult.

The first week, when we did the drive-up distribution, we served about 15,000 meals total for the week, breakfast and lunch combined. Normally we serve 14,000 meals a day. I came home after I did the numbers on that Friday and absolutely broke down to my partner. We had a couple cocktails, and we got all of our angst out about it, and then I said, “Okay, how are we going to fix this?” So we switched to our bus routes. Last week, we served 42,000 meals, and it’s much closer to what we do in a normal school week.

I am immunocompromised, so I’m very conscious of my own health. I’m doing most of the things that I should be — my alcohol intake at the end of every day probably doesn’t help my immune system, but it’s my quarantini, so I go with it. I do feel safe. I feel like we’re doing all that we can with what we have right now to make sure that we’re continuing to nourish our students and ensure that our staff is cared for. Lunch ladies are not the kind of people who are going to sit at home through something like this.

https://www.vox.com/,"The coronavirus has already upended America’s election process.

Sixteen states have postponed their primary elections due to the pandemic. Wisconsin, a crucial toss-up state, forced voters to wait in five-hour lines during a shelter-in-place order for its election on April 7.

Beyond the logistical obstacles, the pandemic is a big problem for anyone already worried about voting rights. Republicans have spent the last decade or so pushing measures to make it harder to vote, including voter ID, purges of voter rolls, and closing polling places. The John Roberts Supreme Court has been right there with them.

And now, as we just saw in Wisconsin (and more recently in Kentucky), the Republican Party is eager to exploit the coronavirus crisis to advance this agenda and put up obstacles for voters living through stay-at-home orders and worried about their health. (It’s worth noting that their tactics in Wisconsin may have backfired.)

David Daley has been reporting on America’s electoral system for the last several years. His 2016 book, Ratf**ked, was a deep look at the GOP’s decade-long gerrymandering strategy and its impact on voting rights. Daley’s new book, Unrigged, is about the grassroots efforts to undo the damage done by that strategy and make the election process freer and fairer. A lot of progress has been made, Daley argues, but much of it could be reversed by the coronavirus.

I spoke to Daley about what reversal might look like, if the recent debacle in Wisconsin is a sign of what’s to come, and near the end, I ask him about the potential nightmare scenario for voting rights in November.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You called the GOP’s 2010 gerrymandering plan “the most audacious political heist of modern times.” Did the Democrats ever really recover from it?

David Daley

No. The GOP’s gerrymandering plan (called REDMAP) has shaped our politics for the last decade.

There are 59 million Americans right now that live in a state in which one or both chambers of the state legislature are controlled by the party that won fewer votes in 2018. Fifty-nine million of those people live in a state where Democrats won more votes and Republicans won more seats.

That’s the end result of this redistricting cycle, and these maps have held that strong in all of these state legislatures. So there’s no question that Democrats haven’t recovered from this, and it’s hard to appreciate how much this distorted our politics.

“The nightmare would be uncertain elections decided by gerrymandered state legislatures in ways that don’t reflect the wishes of the states”

Sean Illing

There’s a ton to say about this, but I want to pivot to what’s happening right now. We’re having this conversation just days after the Supreme Court handed a major defeat to Democrats in Wisconsin who tried to make it easier for people to vote during the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican gambit failed in the end, but is this a sign of what’s to come in November?

David Daley

Wisconsin was a dress rehearsal for what we’re going to see in November. I think it’s entirely likely that in many states, in many cities, it’s going to be absolutely impossible to conduct the kind of traditional in-person voting that this country has gotten used to. We’re going to need to expand the vote-by-mail options for more people.

What happened in Wisconsin is that 1.2 million people applied for absentee ballots. It overwhelmed these underfunded election boards in the state, and they weren’t able to handle it effectively.

The post office this week still had ballots in envelopes stacked up in many places across Wisconsin. And what you saw was that the governor, a Democratic governor in this case, stepped up and said, rightly, that it’s not safe to ask people to vote [in person] in the middle of this [coronavirus] crisis. And Republicans forced the matter into the courts.

Can you imagine a similar situation in November? I can, and it’s horrifying. This is how a public health crisis turns into a constitutional crisis.

Sean Illing

Something you’re hinting at that’s worth making explicit is Republicans are likely to exploit the confusion that will invariably result from trying to pivot to a mail-in election in such a short time. That’s a huge deal because a key strategy on the right is to create the impression of illegitimacy so as to undermine the whole process.

David Daley

Exactly. If it’s impossible to hold in-person voting in places around the country, if we have not taken appropriate steps to run an efficient, safe, and secure mail balloting, we lay the groundwork for a brutal fight about the legitimacy of the election, and that will lead to the courts stepping in. And we just got a pretty good sense from the US Supreme Court about how they will rule if similar questions come before them.

Sean Illing

What are the steps we need to take now to make this transition to mail-in voting successful?

David Daley

In two-thirds of American states, you can request an absentee ballot for absolutely any condition without an excuse. In one-third of our states, you need a specific excuse, and in many of those places, a pandemic is not enough. So we need Congress to take action to ensure that all Americans have the right to cast a mail-in ballot.

We [also] need to be passing laws in states that allow election officials to begin opening and counting and preparing ballots ahead of Election Day. In Pennsylvania and Michigan, for example, election officials are barred from beginning to open and count the ballots prior to Election Day. That might be okay if mail-in ballots are a small percentage of the overall vote, but if it’s a large percentage, they’re going to be deluged, and you’re not going to have results out of these states until much later than usual, which, of course, just opens the door to more rhetoric about voter fraud and the like.

Election boards need to be funded properly as well. This is why the Brennan Center and others have called for at least $2 billion for states to pay for the ramping up, for the printing of ballots, for the return postage, for the optical scanners and the training of employees. These are the things that we have to be thinking about now.

“Wisconsin was a dress rehearsal for what we’re going to see in November”

Sean Illing

Six states already vote entirely by mail. Is that a model other states can easily replicate?

David Daley

Oregon has been doing this for a long time. A lot of these states have had time to master this process. There are a lot of technicalities that have to be worked out, but there are models that are available for states to emulate.

What I think is important is that the states that do this are able to do it successfully and without voter fraud. They need to be able to do it securely and in a way that drives up turnout among voters of all parties. We know this can work. We know that it’s nonpartisan, but these are uncharted waters, and if we want to safeguard the election this fall, we need to be moving quickly in this direction.

Sean Illing

The benefits of mail-in voting are obvious enough, especially in a pandemic, but are there any under-appreciated downsides? Could the process be rigged or hijacked?

David Daley

Rigged or hijacked? No, I don’t think so. Indeed, by most indications, [vote by mail] makes it really obvious if someone is trying to rig or hijack it.

Just look at North Carolina in 2018 when there was an absentee ballot scandal going on there. It was pretty clear and people were able to report, “Hey, there was this guy, and he came to my door and said he was collecting my ballot.” Oregon did a study of more than 100 million ballots that had been cast there by mail since they started, and they found 14 cases of possible fraud. So, 14 cases out of more than a hundred million ballots — that’s a pretty low number.

But we do have to think about places where the mail is not safe or secure or where post offices are far away from folks. I’m thinking particularly about Native American tribal land. In the new book, I talk about the impact of vote-by-mail on Navajo in San Juan County in Utah, a county the size of New Jersey where there are only three post offices in gas stations, and people might go to them once a month. We have to do something to ensure that if you live on Native American land, if you live deep in rural America where there may not be easy post office access, that your right to vote is still protected. And the same for public housing where mailboxes may not be as secure.

The other question often falls around signature verification. We’ve seen that young people and minorities most often have their votes thrown out for improper signature verification. It happens at a higher rate for those groups, and states can fix that. You can simply pass a statute that says if you’re throwing out a ballot for that purpose, you have to contact the voter and allow them to come in and verify that ballot.

All of this speaks to how thoughtfully the process needs to be constructed.

Sean Illing

You gestured at something I think we have to just say plainly: Republicans are actively trying to suppress minority votes because they know that will help them win elections. Does an all-mail-in election create new opportunities for voter suppression?

David Daley

I think that given what we’ve seen over the last decade, we would be naive to think that the Republican Party would not attempt to twist every electoral rule that they can in their favor — they’ve become very good at this over the last decade. You’ve already begun to see President Trump suggest that he supports mail-in ballots for military members and senior citizens, so they’ll seek to limit access to specific demographics that they know are more likely to be on their side.

A really important question here is whether you provide postage for return ballots. A state like Washington that does all-mail ballots covers return postage. If you don’t do that, then you are creating what could potentially be seen as an additional poll tax. And as I was saying earlier, the issue of signature verification has been shown to have a more negative effect on minority voters and younger voters and that has to be looked at as well.

So yeah, there are always going to be fresh avenues for voter suppression, and that’s just a battle we’ll be waging no matter how we vote.

“This is how a public health crisis turns into a constitutional crisis”

Sean Illing

What’s the biggest nightmare scenario this November?

David Daley

Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution gives state legislatures the right to essentially appoint electoral college electors. The nightmare scenario is that gerrymandered state legislatures in swing states appoint electors in ways that may or may not be reflective of the wishes of that state.

Sean Illing

That seems pretty damn unlikely, but what would it look like?

David Daley

Think of a swing state like, say, Wisconsin, which we know will be close in November. I think it came down to something like 22,000 votes in 2016. So let’s say Wisconsin isn’t able to safely hold in-person voting in Milwaukee on Election Day. And let’s say we end up with an outcome that’s highly disputed. In that case, the ultimate authority to appoint electors would sit with the state legislature. So the nightmare would be uncertain elections decided by gerrymandered state legislatures in ways that don’t reflect the wishes of the states.

Can I try to end this on an optimistic note?

Sean Illing

God, yes—

David Daley

We saw in 2018 that a lot of Americans were willing to get engaged and fight for voting rights, and they made huge gains. They circulated petitions and built organizations and won big change, and I think we ought to be heartened by it even in these dark moments. The battle for voting rights has never been a straight line, but what matters is that we’re all engaged in that fight.

Dr. King talked about the moral arc of the universe being long but bending toward justice. I think what we have all learned is that it doesn’t bend by itself; it only bends when we all get involved and actively take hold of it and push it in the right direction.

Toby Ord on existential risk, Donald Trump, and thinking in probabilities

April 9, 2020 | Oxford philosopher Toby Ord spent the early part of his career spearheading the effective altruism movement, founding Giving What We Can, and focusing his attention primarily on issue areas like global public health and extreme poverty. Ord’s new book The Precipice is about something entirely different: the biggest existential risks to the future of humanity. In it, he predicts that humanity has approximately a 1 in 6 chance of going completely extinct by the end of the 21st century. The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that tail risk is real. We always knew a zoological respiratory virus could become a global pandemic. But, collectively, we didn’t want to think about it, and so we didn’t. The result is the reality we live in now.

But for all the current moment’s horror, there are worse risks than coronavirus out there. One silver lining of the current crisis might be that it gets us to take them seriously, and avert them before they become unstoppable. That’s what Ord’s book is about, and it is, in a strange way, a comfort.

This, then, is a conversation about the risks that threaten humanity’s future, and what we can do about them. It’s a conversation about thinking in probabilities, about the ethics of taking future human lives seriously, about how we weigh the risks we don’t yet understand.

Elizabeth Warren has a plan for this, too

April 6, 2020 | In January, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to release a plan for combatting coronavirus. In March, she released a second plan. Days later, with the scale of economic damage increasing, she released a third. Warren’s proposals track the spread of the virus: from a problem happening elsewhere and demanding a surge in global health resources to a pandemic happening here, demanding not just a public health response, but an all-out effort to save the US economy. Warren’s penchant for planning stands in particular stark contrast to this administration, which still has not released a clear coronavirus plan. There is no document you can download, no web site you can visit, that details our national strategy to slow the disease and rebuild the economy.

So I asked Warren to return to the show to explain what the plan should be, given the cold reality we face. We discussed what, specifically, the federal government should do; the roots of the testing debacle; her idea for mobilizing the economy around building affordable housing; why she thinks that this is exactly the right time to cancel student loan debt; why America spends so much money preparing for war and so little defending itself against pandemics and climate change; whether she thinks the Democratic primary focused on the wrong issues; and how this crisis is making a grim mockery of Ronald Reagan’s old saw about “the scariest words in the English language.”

What social solidarity demands of us in a pandemic

April 2, 2020 | There is no doubt that social distancing is the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But the efficacy of social distancing (or really any other public health measure) relies on something much deeper and harder to measure: social solidarity.

“Solidarity,” writes Eric Klinenberg, “motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor’s door.” Klinenberg, a sociologist by trade, is the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. His first book, Heat Wave, found that social connection was, at times, literally the difference between life and death during Chicago’s 1995 heat wave. Since then, he’s spent his career studying trends in American social life, from the rise of adults living alone to the importance of “social infrastructure” in holding together our civic bonds.

This conversation is about what happens when a country mired in a mythos of individualism collides with a pandemic that demands social solidarity and collective sacrifice. It’s about preventing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation from overwhelming the most vulnerable among us. We discuss the underlying social trends that predated coronavirus, what kind of leadership it takes to actually bring people together, the irony of asking young people and essential workers to sacrifice for the rest of us, whether there’s an opportunity to build a different kind of society in the aftermath of Covid-19, and much more.

Coronavirus has pushed US-China relations to their worst point since Mao

March 30, 2020 | The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder that the worst really can happen. Tail risk is real risk. Political leaders fumble, miscalculate, and bluster into avoidable disaster. And even as we try to deal with this catastrophe, the seeds of another are sprouting.

The US-China relationship will define geopolitics in the 21st century. If we collapse into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism, the results could be hellish. And we are, right now, collapsing into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism.

The Trump administration, and key congressional Republicans, are calling COVID-19 “the Chinese virus,” and trying to gin up tensions to distract from their domestic failures. Chinese government officials, beset by their own domestic problems, are claiming the US military brought the virus to China. The US-China relationship was in a bad way six months ago, but this is a new level of threat.

Evan Osnos covers the US-China relationship for the New Yorker, and is author of the National Book Award winner, The Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China. In this conversation, we discuss the past, present and future of the US-China relationship. What are the chances of armed conflict? What might deescalation look like? And we know what the US wants — what, in truth, does China want?

Is the cure worse than the disease?

March 26, 2020 | “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself!” That was President Donald Trump, this week, explaining why he was thinking about lifting coronavirus guidelines earlier than public-health experts recommended. The “cure,” in this case, is social distancing, and the mass economic stoppage it forces. The problem, of course, is COVID-19, and the millions of deaths it could cause.

This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously. Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

An economic crisis like we’ve never seen

March 23, 2020 | “What is happening,” writes Annie Lowrey, “is a shock to the American economy more sudden and severe than anyone alive has ever experienced.”

It’s also different from what anyone alive has ever experienced. For many of us, the Great Recession is the closest analogue — but it’s not analogous at all. There, the economy’s potential was unchanged, but financial markets were in crisis. Here, we are purposefully freezing economic activity in order to slow a public health crisis. Early data suggests the economic crisis is going to far exceed any single week or quarter of the financial crisis. Multiple economists have told Ezra Klein that the nearest analogy to what we’re going through is the economy during World War II.

“I have a secret advantage when trying to understand moments of economic upheaval. I’m married to Annie Lowrey,” writes Ezra Klein. “I can give you the bio — staff writer at the Atlantic, author of Give People Money (which is proving particularly prophetic and influential right now) — but suffice to say she’s one of the clearest and most brilliant economic thinkers I know. Her viral piece on the affordability crisis is crucial for understanding what the economy really looked like before Covid-19, and she’s been doing some of the best work on the way Covid-19 will worsen the economic problems we had and create a slew of new ones. But this isn’t just a conversation about crisis. It’s also a conversation about how to respond. I wouldn’t call it hopeful — we’re not there yet. But constructive.”

He also discusses the logic behind travel bans and limits of their efficacy, why it’s impossible for the US to completely cut itself off from China, and what Trump didn’t say in his Oval Office address, but should have.

https://www.vox.com/,"The United States has now reported more than 672,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 30,000 deaths. The global total is at nearly 2.2 million cases and nearly 150,000 dead.

Yet President Donald Trump has just put forward new guidelines for how US states can begin to ease some of the lockdown restrictions that have been in place for the past several weeks.

On Thursday, the president revealed his administration’s step-by-step plan to “Open Up America Again,” though he said that, ultimately, the decision to begin easing shutdowns would be left to the discretion of state governors. Some states are already considering plans to loosen measures in the coming weeks; others have extended their lockdowns.

The steps themselves laid out in the plan make sense; they offer a gradual, phased-in approach to bringing people back to work and reopening businesses. But the US still lacks large-scale testing or surveillance infrastructure, which means that even this kind of careful, gradual reopening risks once again sparking outbreaks.

China on Friday revised the official death toll in Wuhan — where the virus first originated — raising it by nearly 50 percent, from 2,579 to 3,869. Officials denied a coverup, but the massive revision is likely to raise even more questions about Beijing’s handling of the pandemic.

And in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro fired his health minister, who was both popular and widely praised for trying to stanch the outbreak in the Latin America country, even as Bolsonaro tried to downplay it.

Here’s what you need to know today.

A plan to reopen the US?

On Thursday, Trump released his proposal for reopening the American economy, after weeks of shutdowns across the country because of the coronavirus. The lockdown measures appear to be slowing the public health crisis, but they have pushed the US economy to the brink of collapse, with approximately 22 million Americans filing for unemployment in just about one month.

“Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we are starting our life again. We are starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and a very responsible fashion,” Trump said at a press conference Thursday. “We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time.”

Trump said that governors would “call the shots,” and said some states that have not been badly hit by the virus could start reopening soon, while others might take longer.

Broadly, the plan lays out three phases. Phase One asks vulnerable individuals to stay at home and encourages everyone else to maintain social distancing measures like avoiding socializing in groups of 10 or more people and keeping nonessential travel to a minimum. It also says large venues, like movie theaters, can reopen if distancing measures are in place, but bars should stay closed.

Phase Two loosens restrictions further, allowing for nonessential travel and gradually reopening schools and bars, the latter with reduced capacity. Vulnerable people should continue to shelter in place; everyone else is asked to avoid gatherings of 50 or more.

Phase Three says vulnerable people can resume normal activities, while advising them to still be cautious, and places can open for business, though some must adopt some social distancing limits and/or increased sanitary practices.

The plan also includes specific criteria states or regions must meet before beginning each phase. You can read the full proposal here.

The phase-in proposal is similar to what other countries, like Germany, have put forward in a gradual attempt to reopen businesses and schools.

But — and it’s a very big “but” — it’s unclear whether the United States actually has the infrastructure in place yet — things like massive, widespread testing and contact tracing — for this kind of phased-in reopening plan to work.

Social distancing measures aren’t a cure-all to coronavirus; they’re meant to put society on pause to slow the rate of infection so the health care system is not overwhelmed. But they’re not meant to replace other measures like testing, contact tracing, surveillance, and isolation of the sick.

In fact, testing has actually slowed in the United States, driven in part by shortages of equipment, reagents, test kits, and machines to run the tests, and in part because in many places, the criteria for being tested is still heavily tilted toward health care workers and people who are sick enough to require medical treatment.

As Vox’s German Lopez explains:

This is one reason the plans to end social distancing are so grim: Not only do they suggest that some level of social distancing will be needed for the next year or so (until a vaccine or a similarly effective treatment is widely available) — which we don’t know if the country can sustain — but they call for a level of surveillance and testing the US simply hasn’t shown the ability and willingness to build and manage yet.

This may change, especially as business leaders themselves begin to put pressure on the administration to widely ramp up testing capabilities.

But Friday, the president — who just said Thursday that he would let governors call the shots — is already using Twitter to do the opposite, calling for specific states (particularly ones that have seen protests against stay-at-home orders recently) to be “liberated.”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

LIBERATE MICHIGAN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

LIBERATE MINNESOTA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

Trump’s mixed messages may be a political ploy to portray himself as the “good guy” who wants to get everyone back to work.

But Trump said governors would have discretion on when to reopen, and undermining those governors who feel stay-at-home orders are still necessary to protect the people of their state could have devastating consequences. A premature loosening of rules will only deepen both the public health crisis and the economic pain.

China dramatically revises its coronavirus death toll

The coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and the Chinese government has faced mounting criticism for hiding information about the severity of the virus in the early days of the pandemic, which experts say helped create the global catastrophe the world is seeing now.

And given the scale of the crisis, China’s own statistics about the coronavirus have been called into question throughout the course of the pandemic. The country imposed a months-long, unprecedented lockdown to control the virus, but the US intelligence community and others say China has underreported both the total number of cases and the death toll in the country.

Now, China has revised the official death toll in Wuhan by more than 1,200, an increase of about 50 percent. The number of coronavirus deaths jumped from 2,579 to 3,869. Officials also slightly revised up the number of infections in the city by more than 300, for a new total of more than 50,000.

Officials said the revision was because of incorrect and delayed reporting, not from some attempt to cover up information, according to the Guardian.

“Medical workers at some facilities might have been preoccupied with saving lives and there existed delayed reporting, underreporting or misreporting, but there has never been any cover-up and we do not allow cover-ups,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing.

(Zhao Lijian is the same Chinese official who, in order to shift blame away from China for its mishandling of the outbreak, promoted the conspiracy theory that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.)

All countries, not just China, have faced legitimate difficulties in reporting statistics as hospitals and officials deal with a fast-moving health emergency and a novel virus. New York City also revised up its death toll by thousands this week, including people who died at home without a coronavirus test but likely succumbed to the disease. Italy, too, has said it might be undercounting deaths.

But when it comes to China, these new figures will only fuel suspicions that China has tried to hide information, especially given its lack of forthrightness in the early stages of the pandemic.

Jair Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s Dr. Fauci

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the coronavirus threat in his country. He hosted a huge rally in March. He has tried to undermine states that have imposed social distancing restrictions to protect their citizens by telling everyone to just go back to work.

“We have to face this virus, but face it like a man, dammit, not a boy,” Bolsonaro said in early April. “We have to face it with reality. That’s life. We’re all going to die someday.”’

Through it all, coronavirus infections have continued to rise in Brazil, with the country now registering more than 30,000 cases and nearly 2,000 deaths — although Bolsonaro has questioned those statistics, accusing governors of manipulating the data for political ends.

All of this put Bolsonaro’s health minister, Henrique Mandetta, in a truly awkward position.

Mandetta is a doctor who’s become popular in the country for trying to communicate the real risks of the coronavirus to Brazilians. He’s encouraged social distancing measures and backed up the states in discouraging gatherings and curtailing business. And he’s tried to convey all of this information while navigating his boss’s misinformed talking points.

Which, uh, may sound familiar to anyone who has been following the trials and tribulations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force. And sure enough, as Bolsonaro is often compared to Trump, Mandetta has been compared to Dr. Fauci.

In an interview on Sunday, Mandetta basically called out his boss, saying that he “hoped we can speak with a single, unified message, because otherwise Brazilians end up doubting.”

“They don’t know whether to listen to the health minister [or] the president. Who should they listen to?” he added.

It seems Bolsonaro finally had enough of Mandetta contradicting him, and on Thursday Bolsonaro fired him.

And many Brazilians are angry. People had already been protesting daily against Bolsonaro’s handling of the crisis, but after Mandetta’s axing, they erupted, with people banging pots and shouting “Bolsonaro murderer” from their windows, according to the Financial Times. Brazil’s leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva accused Bolsonaro of leading the country “to the slaughterhouse.”

Mandetta will be replaced by Nelson Teich, an oncologist who had been working as partner in a medical service consulting firm, according to the Guardian.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump can’t help but sow division, even at a time when Americans are largely united in supporting stay-at-home orders and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Just after 11:21 am Eastern time on Friday, President Donald Trump posted a trio of tweets endorsing the so-called liberation of a trio of states with Democratic governors from measures they’ve taken to slow the spread of coronavirus.

These posts — which are among the most dangerous of Trump’s tenure — appear to have been inspired by a segment he saw on Fox News minutes earlier.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump began, with two further tweets saying “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd amendment. It is under siege!”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

At 11:19 — two minutes before Trump’s Minnesota tweet — Fox News ran a segment about small groups of right-wing protesters in Minnesota and Virginia who have been agitating for governors there to relax stay-at-home orders so they can resume normal shopping and traveling activities.

Fox has extensively covered right-wing demonstrations in Michigan on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week, which echo the same theme. Early Friday afternoon, Fox News displayed chyrons promoting an anti-stay-at-home protest scheduled for later in the day in Minnesota.

Fox News’s coverage might give you the idea that these protesters represent the views of a significant chunk of people in their states. But polling indicates that’s not the case. For instance, a YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 61 percent of Americans think Trump should institute a nationwide stay-at-home order, compared to just 22 percent who are opposed. Along the same lines, polling from the Pew Research Central released on Thursday showed that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) noted in response to the so-called “Operation Gridlock” in her state, the sad irony is that such demonstrations could end up extending the need for stay-at-home orders by spreading the virus among protesters. But asked on Thursday if he thinks protesters in Michigan should listen to local officials like Whitmer, Trump said that such people listen to him instead.

“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me,” Trump said.

JON KARL: Shouldn't the anti-stay-at-home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities?



TRUMP: ""I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me."" pic.twitter.com/842jov2kY8 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

One shudders to contemplate what sorts of actions right-wing protesters might take if they interpret Trump’s call for them to “LIBERATE” their states seriously.

https://www.vox.com/,"Millions of newly laid-off Americans are now wondering how to access government unemployment benefits as they scramble to cover rent, groceries, and other daily necessities. Vox is here to help readers navigate the bureaucracy.

Congress has significantly expanded unemployment insurance as part of its historic $2 trillion CARES Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump. Laid-off or furloughed Americans who file for unemployment through their states will see an extra $600 per week added on to that existing state benefit. The average benefit in the US is about $385 per week, but some states are more generous than others.

There are a few key things to know about this new law, as my colleague Dylan Matthews recently explained. First and foremost, it adds $600 to every weekly unemployment check. Second, more people now qualify for unemployment insurance than before. The law creates a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for freelancers, independent contractors, or gig economy workers who previously were ineligible for unemployment insurance. The law also makes benefits easier to access by waiving some states’ requirements for people to look for work. These programs will provide people the increased assistance for four months — late March until July. And with many states still setting up their Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs, benefits will be paid out retroactively. That means even if workers can’t apply for benefits until May, they will ultimately still receive what they are owed from the time they were laid off.

“The UI provisions in the CARES Act were some of — if not the — strongest provisions of the act,” said labor economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute and formerly part of the Obama administration. “It will alleviate the hardship of millions of people.”

People who have already filed for regular unemployment benefits because they were laid off from a job should be starting to see the expanded benefit show up in their checks in the coming weeks. The process could be a bit more complex for contract or self-employed workers who need to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and are waiting for states to set up these programs.

But because so many people are filing for unemployment all at once, it is causing frustrating delays. Many are experiencing jammed phone lines, and many state unemployment websites have crashed with the high demand, including states like New York, Florida, and Michigan.

“The system’s a little clogged up right now,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. “People should keep trying.” Evermore noted that even if some workers are being told they’re not eligible immediately, that could change in the coming weeks as states start receiving the federal money and set up the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.

“The states need resources in order to administer the UI,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Vox recently. “Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable. So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this.”

Vox crowdsourced common questions from readers and contacted experts to answer them. Here’s our guide on how to access unemployment benefits, who is covered, and much more.

Your unemployment insurance questions, answered

How much does my state offer in base unemployment benefits? And where do I apply?

Here’s a chart that shows each state’s minimum and maximum weekly unemployment benefit, as well as a link to each state’s unemployment office. People can apply online or over the phone, though many states are recommending online applications due to busy phone lines.

Each state has its own guidance, but due to high demand, some states are advising people to call on certain days or at certain times depending on the alphabetical order of their last names or order of their Social Security numbers. Check your state’s website to find out if there are specific guidelines.

Who qualifies for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

The CARES Act opened up unemployment benefits to a range of people who weren’t eligible before, including gig economy workers like drivers for Uber or Lyft, freelancers, and independent contractors. Part-time employees who lost their jobs due to coronavirus will also be covered, as will people who had to stop working to take care of a sick member of their family or homeschool their children.

Bottom line: If coronavirus is responsible for your layoff, furlough, or drastic reduction of your hours — or is preventing you from looking for work because fewer employers are hiring — you have a good chance of getting these expanded benefits. It’s worth applying even if you are unsure if you’ll be covered.

Who doesn’t qualify for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

People who are working from home but still getting a full wage are not eligible for benefits. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible; neither are new entrants into the workforce, like recent college graduates, because they don’t have a long enough work history to apply for benefits.

What documentation do I need to sign up for unemployment insurance?

States ask for some basic information during the application process, including:

Your name, birthdate, and Social Security number

Your last employer’s information, including company name, supervisor’s name, address, and phone number

The last date you worked and the reason you are no longer working

Your gross earnings in the last week you worked (starting Sunday and ending with your last day on the job)

You may also be asked about other employers you worked for in the past 18 months, including the employer name, address, dates of employment, gross wages earned, hours worked per week and hourly rate of pay, and the reason you are no longer working.

This means keeping documentation about your previous income and wages is key. This information can be found on your W-2s, paystubs, or invoices if you are a freelancer or independent contractor.

When will the extra $600 show up in my unemployment check?

This will vary state by state, but the extra money should start appearing soon — likely by next week for people who are already in their state system, but longer for those still waiting for their applications to go through. It takes time for the US Department of Labor to coordinate with state unemployment agencies to get the money flowing. It will likely be longer for freelancers and independent contractors to get the benefit because they are waiting for the government to set up an entirely new program.

“The $600 with existing benefits, people should be in a position to get that within 3 weeks,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. “The disaster benefits, they’re going to take a little time to develop the intake.”

How much could I get over four months? And what happens if there’s a delay in getting the extra money?

All told, the extra $600 per week will add up to around an extra $10,000 over four months. If there is a delay in it showing up in people’s paychecks (which there likely will be), people will be getting retroactive pay in their first paychecks to make up for the lag time.

“That is a way to get a lot more money to people who really need it,” said Stettner. “It has the ability to prevent some of the real damaging parts of unemployment: reducing your savings, food security, having trouble maintaining your housing”

What’s the difference between being furloughed and being laid off? Do furloughed employees qualify for the expanded unemployment insurance program?

Unlike a more permanent layoff, a furlough is a temporary period of unemployment — with a promise that the employee will return to work when economic conditions improve. But the big difference here is that while furloughed employees forgo their wages, they keep other benefits like health insurance. Employees who have been furloughed due to coronavirus will be eligible for expanded unemployment insurance.

What’s the process for gig economy workers or independent contractors?

Freelancers, gig economy workers, and independent contractors will file for unemployment insurance from a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which is still being set up by the Labor Department and states and could take longer to be ready in some states (Washington state, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania have announced their programs will be ready to take applications by the end of April). When the program is available, it can be accessed on state unemployment websites where people apply for regular UI. Check your state’s website for guidance on when and how you should apply, if you fall into this category.

“Gig workers will need to file for PUA first, and then they will get the $600,” said Stettner. “This is the new program part of the law and will take the longest to set up — the pandemic program for gig workers et al.”

What documentation do freelancers or independent contractors who rely on invoices or cash need to prepare to get benefits?

Keeping documentation about your previous income and wages as a freelancer, independent contractor, or self-employed worker is important and will help you when filing for unemployment. Keep documentation both about how you get your money and how much you have been paid per month in the past (old tax returns and invoices are good examples).

“Whatever documentation they have about how they get their money would be helpful,” Evermore added. If people are lacking documentation, they can file good-faith attestations about their wages to unemployment offices, but documents are preferred.

If I’m working two-part time jobs and lose one, can I get benefits for the lost job while still working the other?

Though part-time workers are eligible for expanded benefits, the answer to this question depends on whether the weekly earnings from the second job erase the partial benefit credit you’d get from unemployment, Stettner said.

“In simplest terms, the closer the pay of the second part-time job they have is ... to the first part-time job they lost, the less likely they are to get benefits. The bigger the difference, the more likely to get benefits,” he said.

What if I just got a job offer that is now rescinded or up in the air due to coronavirus?

Again, you are eligible for the expanded unemployment benefits. Having documentation here is also important if you can get it; for instance, having both your offer and a written statement rescinding or postponing that offer that you can send to your state’s unemployment office can be helpful when filing for unemployment.

“However you found your offer was rescinded, keep that handy,” Evermore said.

What if I was unemployed prior to the crisis and am having no luck finding jobs? Can I apply for benefits even if my old benefits ran out?

Yes. Anyone who has exhausted their regular unemployment insurance can get a 13-week extension on their benefits. Once that extension is exhausted, workers can apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Evermore said. “That can go up to 39 weeks total,” she added.

What is the situation for new or soon-to-be college graduates who can’t find a job?

People who are a few months away from graduating college and looking for jobs are in more of a bind because of their limited work history.

There’s a provision in a recently released bill from House Democrats that would allow recent college graduates to qualify for something called a “job seekers allowance,” about half of the benefits available for the rest of workers. But unless Congress passes a provision to allow this, recent college graduates are in a tough spot.

What about employees in houses of worship, including ministers, rabbis, or imams?

In many states, congregations don’t pay unemployment insurance and employees aren’t eligible for unemployment. So unless the specific employer has decided to voluntarily participate in unemployment insurance, employees of churches, synagogues or mosques likely won’t be eligible in most states.

However, Stettner and Evermore said it depends on how the US Department of Labor interprets the language of the CARES Act. If the new pandemic program is treated like a standard disaster relief program, church, synagogue, and mosque employees could be covered — but that won’t be determined until Labor provides more information about how the program is being implemented.

https://www.vox.com/,"Another weekend, another crop of new releases. Movie theaters remain closed around the US as the country continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic, but film lovers have plenty to look forward to on streaming services and through “virtual theatrical” releases.

This weekend boasts gritty new dramas, newly available dramedies, and two documentaries about women artists. (And most of the films that have been newly released to watch in recent weeks still remain available, too.)

Here are eight of the best movies, from a range of genres, that are available to watch at home for the weekend of April 17 — some for a few bucks on digital services, some through virtual theatrical engagements, and some to subscribers on streaming platforms.

45 Years

45 Years, directed by Andrew Haigh, tells the story of long-married couple Geoff and Kate (played by Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling). During the week leading up to their 45th wedding anniversary celebration, the pair’s steady relationship is interrupted by an unexpected letter. And while the news in the letter is a reminder of a past that barely concerns them now, it throws them into a strange uneasiness, and flips everything they thought they knew on its head. One of the more poignant examinations of a long marriage I’ve ever seen, 45 Years is a slow, empathetic, and knowing drama.

How to watch it: 45 Years is streaming on the Criterion Channel as well as on IFC Unlimited. It’s also available to digitally rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Google Play, and Vudu.

Beyond the Visible: Hilma af Klint

The brilliant Swedish painter Hilma af Klint made groundbreaking abstract work, often with techniques that predated those used by artists like Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian by decades. But she is a curiously underappreciated artist, both in her time and in ours; her paintings were rescued from near obscurity only in the mid-1980s, and she has been studied and hailed as innovative since, but the Museum of Modern Art still doesn’t own a single one of her works. Beyond the Visible explores the reasons for her exclusion from the official narrative of abstraction, but more importantly, it looks at the spiritual basis for and interests presented in her paintings. The film is a beautiful, illuminating tribute to the artist, and an argument for her importance.

How to watch it: Beyond the Visible: Hilma af Klint is in virtual theaters this week, and a list of participating theaters is available on the Kino Marquee website. (You’ll receive a rental link, and profits help support the independent theater you select on the page.)

Anna Rose Holmer’s feature debut stars newcomer Royalty Hightower as Toni, an 11-year-old trying to fit in with the older girls on her school’s dance team. When some of the girls on the team start to experience mysterious fits, Toni, along with her peers, wonders what’s happening. The Fits has no answers, but it’s a masterful and confident take on the pressure to become part of the crowd among adolescent girls. It was one of the best films of 2016 — a true gem.

How to watch it: The Fits is streaming on the Criterion Channel. It’s also available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, or to digitally rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Google Play, or Vudu.

Hail, Caesar! is one of the Coen brothers’ overlooked masterpieces. It’s a farcical — but deadly serious — tale of old Hollywood, focusing on a studio executive named Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who’s stuck trying to put out a thousand fires a day. Somehow he gets stuck in a sort of old-fashioned Passion Play, with himself as the man of sorrows trying to rescue everyone else from their sins. The cast is stacked with Hollywood glamour: George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, and more. The story has everything from synchronized swimmers to a coven of communists, and it’s an absolute delight.

How to watch it: Hail, Caesar! is streaming on Netflix. It’s also available to digitally rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Google Play, and Vudu.

Related Hail Caesar is the slapstick comedy about economic philosophy you need right now

The Innocence Project, founded in 1992 by law professors Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, is devoted to overturning wrongful convictions by using DNA evidence to free innocent prisoners, while advocating for reform in the criminal justice system. Netflix’s The Innocence Files tells the stories of some of the people they’ve helped free. In nine documentary episodes — some as long as a feature film — The Innocence Files draws on the same intriguing cases that often become the subjects of true-crime series, while illustrating the breakdown of supposedly just systems and the unreliability of allegedly unimpeachable evidence. It’s among the strongest documentary series about criminal justice I’ve ever seen.

How to watch it: The Innocence Files is streaming on Netflix.

The Quarry

From writer and director Scott Teems (Rectify), The Quarry is a slow-burning tale of sin and redemption. It centers on a mysterious man with a dark past (Shea Whigham) who arrives in a town near the US-Mexico border and poses as a preacher, and soon discovers the town has some darkness as its own. Also starring Michael Shannon in a terrific role as the hard-bitten local sheriff, The Quarry is a meditation on a lot of things — forgiveness, old hurts, racial wounds, and grief — and doesn’t try to provide any easy answers.

How to watch it: The Quarry is available via a variety of on-demand services, including Amazon, AppleTV, Fandango Now, Google Play, Microsoft, and Vudu.

Both deliciously wicked and perceptive about the battle of just getting through the day when you’re a teen, Selah and the Spades follows Paloma (Celeste O’Connor), who is the new girl at Haldwell School, a prestigious boarding school. When she arrives, she’s taken under the wing of Selah (Lovie Simone), a sophisticated upperclassman and the leader of the most powerful of Haldwell’s “factions,” the Spades. Selah and the Spades mixes the classic tropes of mobster movies with the cliques and concerns of high school films, but with a twist that’s all Tayarisha Poe’s. It’s the multitalented director’s first feature film, and it signals a strong voice and vision for filmmaking — one that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

How to watch it: Selah and the Spades is available on Amazon Prime Video.

What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael

Pauline Kael is one of the 20th century’s most important film critics, known for her strong opinions and her sometimes biting, sometimes controversial, always worthwhile reviews. While working as the film critic at the New Yorker from 1968 to 1991, she developed a coterie of young critics to mentor and influenced hundreds more with her work. What She Said is an introduction to Kael’s life and writing through the voices of those who knew her, worked with her, or have been influenced by her. And it’s a look into what film critics do, and maybe more importantly, why they do it.

How to watch it: What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael is in virtual theaters this week, and a list of participating theaters is available on the Film Forum website. (You’ll receive a rental link, and profits help support the independent theater you select on the page.)

https://www.vox.com/,"The number of new coronavirus tests reported each day has plateaued — a big blow to the prospects of America reopening its economy safely anytime soon, even as President Donald Trump insists the country is weeks away from doing so.

Trump announced guidelines on April 16 for states to reopen, calling for governors to ease social distancing measures, such as stay-at-home orders, as the number of new coronavirus cases begin to come down. He acknowledged a requirement for reopening the economy is that the federal government and states must know that the numbers of new coronavirus cases are actually coming down; without widespread testing, they simply can’t know what they’re dealing with and how to act.

Trump also claimed testing is “at an all-time high” and “growing at a historic rate.” But that’s false, based on the actual numbers.

According to the Covid Tracking Project, the US has averaged fewer than 150,000 tests each day so far in the week of April 13, including at both public and commercial labs. That’s an improvement from the early days of March, when the country reported new tests in the dozens and later the hundreds. But it’s not an increase from more recent weeks: In the week of April 6, the country also averaged fewer than 150,000 tests a day.

What the country needs to properly do testing, according to experts, is at least 500,000 tests a day. Some experts call for much more than that — millions or even tens of millions a day — but the general point is that the US needs to be doing multiple times the testing that it’s currently doing to be able to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts.

A recognition of that fact is perhaps the biggest reason the US is social distancing now. One of the big goals during this period is to flatten the curve — reducing the spread of the virus — as the US scales up testing and surveillance systems to let the nation and states better control new clusters of cases.

“The whole point of this social distancing is to buy us time to build up capacity to do the types of public health interventions we know work,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, told me. “If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy. And then when we lift things, we’re no better equipped than we were before.”

Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. “contact tracing”), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise. Without it, the only way to deal with the outbreak is more social distancing, which further hurts the economy, or letting the disease run its course — at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of lives.

The recent slowdown in new tests is driven by shortages in nasal swabs, personal protective equipment, reagents, test kits, and machines needed to run the specific tests required. According to David Lim at Politico, some labs also complain that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s testing criteria — which prioritizes hospitalized patients, health care workers, and those vulnerable to the virus, such as older people — is holding back potential tests, leaving existing testing capacity unused.

To fix the gaps, experts argue, the federal government needs to relax criteria for testing, invest in new supplies and labs, and better coordinate supply chains to address, among other issues, chokepoints. States, with limited resources and little control of the national supply chain, simply can’t do this all on their own.

Such fixes, however, are easier said than done. Experts warn the next phase of testing will be much more difficult than the initial phase, which largely required getting existing labs to start doing coronavirus testing — the low-hanging fruit.

“We’ve made substantial progress ramping testing this month,” Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in a tweet on April 10. “But many gains were made by getting players into fight (clinical labs, academic labs). Now we must expand lab capacity, platforms, throughput, test kits. Getting next million tests/week will be harder than getting first.”

This is one reason the plans to end social distancing are so grim: Not only do they suggest that some level of social distancing will be needed for the next year or so (until a vaccine or a similarly effective treatment is widely available) — which we don’t know if the country can sustain — but they call for a level of surveillance and testing the US simply hasn’t yet shown the ability and willingness to build and manage.

It’s possible the US could get a lucky break; there’s still a lot about the coronavirus that we don’t know, and maybe as we learn more, we’ll realize the country can be spared the worst. (That’s optimistic, given the outbreaks we’ve already seen across the globe, but it’s possible.) The Trump administration and states also still have time to ease testing criteria and scale up capacity in the coming weeks.

But unless something changes, America is simply not meeting the benchmark of aggressive testing that experts say is necessary to start to reopen the country. As eager as Trump is to get the economy going again, the US just isn’t ready to do it in a safe way yet.

https://www.vox.com/,"For years, Timothy Mackey has been researching the sale of opioids and illicit drugs online, tracking how dealers have used social media to push controlled substances. But over the past few weeks, the UC San Diego public health researcher has found himself in the bowels of the internet, trying to track the black market for fake Covid-19 tests and treatments. It turns out the two realms of drug-dealing share some similar scams.

The coronavirus pandemic has fueled demand for a wide variety of products, including some that aren’t readily available to the general American public, like at-home testing kits. Other things, like government-approved, proven Covid-19 treatments or cures, don’t yet exist. But online opportunists are working hard to take advantage of the public’s desperation, selling counterfeits on social media platforms, e-commerce marketplaces, and the dark web.

Mackey told Recode that, even as a public health expert, he’s had trouble quickly differentiating between legitimate and illegitimate products online. That’s partially because news about the Covid-19 pandemic moves so quickly that information about a legitimate product or trial in one country can quickly inspire fake and unapproved products in another.

“Every week there’s a new product or a new scam going on,” Mackey says. The problem is so pervasive that someone even reached out to him (on LinkedIn, of all places) offering to sell him seemingly fake, rapid test kits in bulk.

A fake Covid-19 testing kit is more dangerous than a fake Chanel bag. A counterfeit test could lead someone to believe they’re negative when they’ve been infected. A fake cure could leave someone worse off than before, and possibly dead. Even a phony N95 mask might mislead a doctor into believing they’re protected in a hospital full of Covid-19 patients, where faulty equipment can lead to more spreading of the virus.

Don’t buy drugs or treatments on Instagram

There’s no proven treatment for Covid-19, but plenty of social media accounts are nevertheless illegally pushing so-called cures or treatments. Online, you can find people advertising drugs that are undergoing clinical trials but are not yet approved to treat Covid-19, like chloroquine, as well as more far-out fake treatments involving cow urine, colloidal silver, and even oregano.

Platforms like Instagram and Twitter have banned advertisements for these products, but enforcing those bans seems to be an ongoing challenge. After a few minutes of browsing, we were able to find several posts advertising Covid-19 medications and treatment, an outcome that suggests social platforms are stuck in a game of whack-a-mole with these products, despite the efforts of both human moderators and automation. That’s not unlike the same challenges these platforms have had with stopping the spread of Covid-19 conspiracy theories and fake news.

When Recode sent an example of a suspect chloroquine post to Twitter, the company removed it, citing its policy against the sale of regulated goods.

The trend in fake Covid-19 products is especially troublesome because many of these products can look convincing to the average person. Jay Kennedy, a professor at Michigan State University’s criminal justice school and Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection, emphasizes that it’s relatively easy for counterfeiters to make the package of a fake product look believable: They can buy the vials and boxes from legitimate medical supply companies and then replicate any logos and certification stamps.

The accounts used to advertise these products might look less legitimate. They do not typically have a large number of followers, for instance, and they generally aren’t meant to exist long-term. Sellers have an incentive to keep them online just long enough to attract a buyer.

Mackey and his team are already analyzing a data set of 80 million tweets in addition to Instagram posts. Many of these posts prompt people to call them directly — perhaps using an encrypted app — using Covid-19 terms to advertise. They might ask potential buyers to use Bitcoin or other unusual payment schemes. Angelo Mazza, an intellectual property attorney who recently wrote a brief on Covid-19 counterfeits, adds that weird spellings and formatting of words are a strong hint that a seller isn’t authorized. The apparent typos might actually be attempts to evade screening algorithms set up by the social media platform.

Kennedy notes that another potential source of fake treatments is illegal online pharmacies, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has repeatedly tried to crack down on. “Unlike pharmacies, the vast majority of online pharmacies sell counterfeit medications, and people can ‘get’ drugs, prescription medications without needing a prescription,” he explains.

Regardless, if you see a drug available on the internet that normally requires a prescription you don’t have, don’t buy it. Even if you do manage to get ahold of the real pharmaceutical, it’s dangerous to take a medication unsupervised. One person has already died from taking chloroquine phosphate, for instance, and a recent study shows that coronavirus patients may face the risk of fatal heart complications when taking the drug. Participating in the black market for hydroxychloroquine also contributes to a troubling shortage for people with lupus and arthritis, who can need it to stay healthy.

At-home, FDA-approved Covid-19 tests do not exist, but fake tests are still available online

Beyond fake treatments, social media sites are also filled with accounts pushing rapid, at-home Covid-19 tests. Mackey told Recode that these posts seemed to pop up online suddenly after March 22, likely driven by the news, and that forced his research focus to expand from bogus cures and treatment to various coronavirus testing products. Now, Mackey thinks he’ll spend more time scanning the web for antibody tests, since they’re increasingly being discussed by public health and government officials.

No tests for Covid-19 infection have been approved by the FDA for use at home. There are also no FDA-approved at-home serological tests, which measure the amount of Covid-19 antibodies in a patient’s body and, thus, detect their immunity to the disease. Currently, the best way to be tested for Covid-19 — if you’re considered eligible — is through a medical provider, such as an urgent care facility, a drive-through testing center, or a hospital.

“Most people probably don’t know how a normal test kit works,” explains Kennedy. “That’s one of the major disadvantages that we consumers have. We don’t know how things like that are supposed to operate.”

Black market Covid-19 test sellers seem eager to take advantage of this knowledge gap. On eBay, we found a listing for a “rapid test device” for the Covid-19 antibody from a seven-year-old seller with generally positive feedback. Claiming to be based in Lithuania, the account previously sold mostly clothing.

The product listed certainly seems to resemble a legitimate Covid-19 test. The packaging bears the logo of a company called Realy Tech. The FDA lists “Hangzhou Realy Tech” as a company that’s notified the agency as having validated a serological test on offer, but the agency has not approved or reviewed its validation. Of course, there’s no way to know if this product on eBay was even produced by Realy Tech.

An eBay spokesperson told Recode that the platform is taking steps to block and remove products that make “false health claims,” and by the time of publication, eBay had taken down the above post for promoting false health information. Facebook, meanwhile, had taken down a page that appeared to be from the company Realy Tech.

The fake Covid-19 test problem is more widespread than this single example. Mackey says that many posts like this, using phrases like “Doctor Coronavirus” and “Covid-19” in their usernames, could easily be caught by an algorithm.

When Recode identified examples to Twitter, they were removed for violating the platform’s manipulation and spam rules. Similarly, after Recode identified accounts pushing similar test kit products on Instagram, which were also removed, a Facebook spokesperson explained that the company will take down posts and accounts pushing such products when it is made aware of them.

You can still find people promoting fake test kits, along with other phony coronavirus products, on the dark web.

Suspicious Covid-19 products are already under investigation

Coronavirus-related scams aren’t limited to tests or treatments. As broken supply chains lead to shortages, instances of price-gouging and outright fraud regarding medical supplies are becoming increasingly worrisome. In late March, a health care workers union claimed to secure a stash of 39 million N95 masks to sell to hospitals, a huge claim at the time that many found dubious. The masks never ended up being delivered to some health care centers, and an attempted seizure by federal authorities revealed that they were part of an elaborate, international grift.

Mazza, the intellectual property attorney, points to this example as a warning of what’s to come. “If it sounds too good to be true, there’s likely a problem,” he says. “Let’s look out for the guys selling the magic beans — all the different cliches that come to mind, they’re going to apply tenfold here.”

The number of bad actors seems to be growing. On March 22, the Justice Department announced its “first enforcement action against Covid-19 fraud,” which involved shuttering and launching an investigation into a website that allegedly sold vaccines to unsuspecting Americans in an attempt to capitalize on the fear surrounding the pandemic. The FBI has since arrested one man, after he sold coronavirus “prevention pills” to an undercover agent. And in early April, Customs and Border Protection caught fake Covid-19 test kits being shipped in from the United Kingdom through the Los Angeles International Airport.

In some cases, government investigators are working with tech companies to catch scammers. For instance, Facebook, eBay, Amazon, and others have partnered with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr to go after price gougers and others hoping to profit from the Covid-19 crisis. Twitter, meanwhile, says it’s working with governments and public health authorities to crack down on content that promotes fake treatments.

Fakes will be pervasive as long as Covid-19 is

Ultimately, Mackey explains that trends in fakes and counterfeits will continue to coincide with topics in the news cycle. When there’s a legitimate, Covid-19-related product, scammers and counterfeit sellers will likely emerge to take advantage of the people desperate to get ahold of it.

If and when real versions of at-home tests become available, the problem of fake and scammy tests will likely worsen. Mackey warns that once a vaccine is available, we should expect to see more bogus vaccines pop up as well. And more than 50 health experts warned in a letter earlier this month that any shortages in legitimate Covid-19-related products will make the phony treatment and vaccine problems worse.

Eventually, the onslaught of fake Covid-19 products showing up online could just become part of our new reality.

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Mackey said. “I mean, it’s a full-blown infodemic.”

https://www.vox.com/,"The Democratic presidential primary is over. Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee heading into the election. And this week, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren endorsed their former competitor.

On the left, the question is: What went wrong? How did Sanders lose to Biden? Why didn’t Warren catch fire? But too few of these postmortems have had sufficient data to build out their theories. And too many of them explain away strategic and tactical failures as media or establishment conspiracies.

Sean McElwee has a different perspective. McElwee is the co-founder and executive director of Data for Progress, an organization that utilizes cutting-edge polling and data-analysis techniques to support progressive causes. His aim is to fashion an agenda that is both progressive and popular. But he also sits atop mountains of data that let him test hypotheses with a lot more rigor than most armchair pundits.

As a result, McElwee has a fascinating, heterodox view of the 2020 primary, the Sanders and Warren campaigns, and what it will take for progressives to build power. We discuss the critical mistakes both major progressive candidates made, which progressive ideas are most popular with the American people, how the left’s theory of class politics interferes with its most obvious path to electoral victory, why maximalist policy agendas fail even when they look like they’re succeeding, what good (and bad) Overton Window politics look like, how progressives can shape Biden’s presidency, and much, much more.

You can listen to our full conversation by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show, available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.

As a teaser to our discussion, here are some of McElwee’s findings:

It is extremely difficult to significantly change the composition of the electorate via an inspiring campaign or a killer field operation. It has been tried many, many times and almost always ends in failure.

There is a way to change the composition of the electorate: by changing laws. Legal and structural reform that focuses on a) making it easier to vote (e.g. automatic voter registration) or b) giving people something valuable to protect (e.g. Medicaid expansion) works.

The left’s theory of class politics is grounded in the idea that lower-income, less-educated rural white voters are the likeliest constituency for a left agenda. But those voters, in reality, are much more conservative than the college-educated suburbanites the left often dismisses.

The trifecta of progressive policy issues that resonate most with these voters (and voters in general) are 1) aggressive pharmaceutical reform, 2) a job-creating clean energy agenda, and 3) ambitious paid family leave.

The way that progressives can build institutional power within the Democratic Party is not by trying to flip red districts but by ousting moderate Democrats in relatively safe blue seats.

Incremental legislative victories are an important though often overlooked way of shifting public opinion. In order to pass a major, structural change like Medicare-for-all, you need to prove your theory of the case to voters who are skeptical of change by showing that smaller, incremental changes like Medicaid expansion or lowering prescription drug costs can pass and work when implemented. Those smaller victories are like an investment in the future — they build public confidence in reform that can be cashed in for bigger reform later.

Running on a maximalist policy agenda creates a massive expectation gap between what you can achieve and what you say you can achieve. When you promise something and deliver, you build power. When you promise something and bring home half or a quarter, you deflate hope and create cynicism.

There’s a lot more where that came from. You can listen to our full conversation by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show, available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.

https://www.vox.com/,"Warring factions. Truces and sworn enemies. A fierce leader and her faithful followers. A newcomer who threatens her hold.

That’s the basis for the new film Selah and the Spades, which debuts on April 17 on Amazon Prime Video. But there’s a twist: It all takes place in a preppy high school. Both deliciously wicked and perceptive about the battle of just getting through the day when you’re a teen, the drama follows Paloma (Celeste O’Connor), who is the new girl at Haldwell School, a prestigious boarding school. When she arrives, she’s taken under the wing of Selah (Lovie Simone), a sophisticated upperclassmen and the leader of the most powerful of Haldwell’s “factions,” the Spades. Each faction operates a bit like a gang, with specialties of their own. The Spades’ is to sell drugs to the other students.

Selah and the Spades mixes the classic tropes of mobster movies with the cliques and concerns of high school films, but with a twist that’s all Tayarisha Poe’s. It’s the multitalented director’s first feature film, and it signals a strong voice and vision for filmmaking — one that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

I recently spoke to Poe by phone about the film’s visual style, her influences, the reason she centered her story on an antihero like Selah, and more.

Alissa Wilkinson

Selah and the Spades feels very stylized — it’s obviously a movie made by someone who had a strong idea of the tone and visual style they wanted right from the start.

Tayarisha Poe

Totally. I feel like it’s really obvious when you watch the movie that Wes Anderson is a huge inspiration of mine. When I was in high school and college, seeing Wes Anderson movies was the first time that I had seen something that felt like a storybook in a movie that was made for adults. I was addicted to that feeling of a storybook. Anytime I ask myself, “Why do I make movies?” it always comes back to this love of storytelling, and that feeling of the pages opening and entering into this world.

Also, that movie Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann, do you remember that? That’s one of my favorites. It has that same worldbuilding quality. Like, that’s just fuckin’ Venice, California, and it feels so otherworldly. Definitely that as well. Baz Luhrmann and Wes Anderson.

Alissa Wilkinson

And it’s not like we haven’t seen a movie set in a prep school or a high school before, but this one feels distinctly different. Sometimes it feels like a Martin Scorsese movie or something, with all of these warring gangs.

Tayarisha Poe

Totally. I grew up watching The Godfather. My parents freaking love that trilogy, as do I. I feel like The Godfather, specifically the first one — obviously, it’s a classic, so a lot of us have it in our DNA as filmmakers and as writers. But every time I watch it, it feels like returning home. So I feel like there’s a lot of Godfather influence in Selah and the Spades.

But even more than that, there’s this movie called Brick by Rian Johnson, who’s one of my favorite filmmakers. I’ve loved that movie since I first saw it. Right after I saw it, I made one of my first short films, and it was just a complete rip-off of Brick because I loved it so much.

The reason I love Brick is it does what I’m trying to do in Selah and the Spades: It takes this language and this mood and this atmosphere that is decidedly adult and serious and weighted and heavy, and places it in this world that’s typically seen as unserious — a teenaged world.

Because of this movie, I’ve been spending time with teenagers for years now, and they are serious human beings. They’re all just figuring out life, and that’s not that much different from being an adult. I’m really drawn to the complexity of being a teenager; there’s so much that you’re experiencing for the first time. I like the way that when teenagers are heartbroken, they feel like they might die, and it’s because they don’t really know if they’re gonna die or not. That weightiness that teenagers feel about themselves and their own life fits in nicely and naturally with the language and atmosphere of a classic mob film.

Alissa Wilkinson

At the heart of this movie, you have a great antihero: Selah, who is obviously not someone we should emulate, but we might admire her. How did she come to you?

Tayarisha Poe

Selah is just ... she’s a teenage girl. [Laughs.] She’s a teenage girl who has a little bit more power than most teenage girls do. But I think that she is crafted after the teenage girls that I knew when I was a teenager, and the one I saw myself as, as well.

What was really important to me with Selah as a character were her decisions. Those decisions that we may not agree with her making, because we’re not in her situation — those decisions always make logical sense to her. I wanted to make sure the character was always logical, even if we disagreed with her logic. I feel like that’s a trait that all the great antihero characters share, like Walter White in Breaking Bad and Tony Soprano in The Sopranos. They do terrible, messed-up shit, but they always know how to explain it. Their explanation always makes just the right amount of sense right before they have to stop themselves and admit that it’s just ego that got them there. I like that Selah’s ego fits in with this weird sense of logic that she has.

Alissa Wilkinson

So you have these compelling characters, but you set them down in a visual environment that’s very striking, too. How do you design that world so it’s visually interesting and grabs people’s attention? What’s your process like, especially with your background as a photographer?

Tayarisha Poe

A lot of it does come from how much photography influences my storytelling. I’ve been doing photography since high school, since I’ve been making movies. Once I picked up a camera, I started doing both.

Do you know this movie by Chris Marker, La Jetée? It’s like a half-hour long. They showed it to us when I was in high school in Intro to Film, and I was just blown away by the fact that this movie could be a bunch of photographs with some voiceover and a little bit of atmospheric sound and, like, five seconds of moving image, and that could constitute a movie.

So, once I saw that, I was like, okay, maybe a movie is not — this idea isn’t totally formed, but it’s something I keep thinking about every time I start a project — maybe a movie isn’t what we think it is. I keep asking myself, “What makes a film? What makes a movie?” Not just the physical medium, but conceptually, what makes a movie?

So, when Jomo [Fray] — the cinematographer [for Selah and the Spades], a great friend and a genius, truly — and I got into making the shot listing for the film, we just dug in. We really dipped into our love of photography, and our love of images that can in their own right tell an entire story, so that whatever we’re adding is telling a new story or a new version of that story. I think what cemented it for us was this idea that Selah is the predator, and in her eyes, everyone else is prey. Then how do we capture that as we’re moving throughout this school, and how do we capture Paloma?

What it boiled down to was this idea that we called savage formalism, which, believe it or not, is borne out of our love for Rihanna and her album Anti. She has this one line on “Needed Me” where she goes, “Didn’t they tell you that I was a savage?” She’s presumably saying to this man, “I can’t believe you’re sitting here crying in front of me about how wrong I did you. Didn’t they warn you about me?” She is just so unapologetically savage. So part of what we wanted to do [with Selah] was [incorporate] that sort of savagery, that impossibly cool projection of self that Rihanna has.

The formalism comes from talking about brutalist architecture and what happens to a society after a war. We thought about the world of Haldwell School, the system of the factions in the school. Everything is a little bit tense because no one has been running things for so long, and power is constantly shifting. So what happens to their world, this beautiful world of this boarding school with all these hip, cool young kids? What does this beauty look like through the eyes of a person, Selah, who’s been through this war of high school? That’s how we came up with this very non-high school way to look at high school. It was fun.

Alissa Wilkinson

It’s fun to watch, too. As Selah and the Spades has played at film festivals, people have seen it, and you’ve been around to hear their reactions. Have you heard anything in particular from teenagers who’ve seen it? What are they saying? What do they say to you?

Tayarisha Poe

Yeah. We actually got to play it at TIFF’s Next Wave, which was just one of the greatest experiences of my life. [Note: The Next Wave program at the Toronto International Film Festival features films selected by a committee of film enthusiasts aged 15 to 18.] Shout-out to all those kids because they’re brilliant and so smart. They’re a bunch of high schoolers, and they ask the best questions, and it was really refreshing to talk to them about it because it’s really a story for them.

I think people who are post-college, people who are my age — millennials, I guess, because now we’re all old — we can look back at high school and say, “Oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn’t have done those things, but everybody’s okay now.” Or you look back at high school and say, “Oh, maybe it wasn’t the best time, but it was, like, mostly pretty cool.” It’s all hindsight. But I think for teenagers, it’s happening right now, so they’re feeling these emotions right now, and they’re going through this tumultuous time period of figuring out college or dealing with their parents and dealing with their friends or handling all their stuff right now. So I think their reaction was much more visceral than I was even expecting.

I think a lot of them felt very seen. They hadn’t seen somebody who looked like them on screen do these things before. I don’t know if audiences who are white realize or recognize what it feels like to not see yourself all the time, just constantly not see yourself, and when you do see yourself, you’re being shot by a cop or you’re going to jail. It’s a traumatic experience. It’s incredibly refreshing to sit and watch a movie, at least for me — not necessarily Selah, but just any movie that stars black people — and not be afraid that the thing that will destroy this character is racism, or white supremacy, or things that are out of their control.

So I think that a lot of the kids who saw Selah and the Spades were just reacting to this relief of seeing themselves make it, seeing themselves have fun, and seeing themselves question authority and still survive — more than survive, thrive.

Selah and the Spades is available on Amazon Prime Video.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump more or less declared victory over the coronavirus during the daily White House briefing on Thursday — ignoring signs that the fight against a disease he likes to call “the invisible enemy” is actually far from over.

Trump began by saying that “thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection.” (In fact, as recently as late February, Trump was saying the virus would go away on its own without any Americans dying.) He went on to outline the “Opening Up America Again” criteria that will guide states with sufficient testing capacity and declining numbers of new cases through the process of getting their schools and economies back up and running in a step-by-step manner, with the approval of governors.

“Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we are starting our life again,” Trump said. “We are starting rejuvenation of our economy again.”

TRUMP: ""Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection."" (As recently as late February Trump was projecting no Americans would die from coronavirus.) pic.twitter.com/ZMebnX2tYq — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

But Trump’s claim that America is on the downside of new cases is dubious. Because the country still doesn’t have enough testing capacity to accommodate everyone who has symptoms or has come into contact with those who do, it’s possible the plateau in new cases that’s happened over the past week just reflects the reality that many cases are going undetected.

A new piece from Robinson Meyer and Alexis C. Madrigal for the Atlantic explains:

The growth in the number of new tests completed per day has also plateaued. Since April 1, the country has tested roughly 145,000 people every day with no steady upward trajectory. The growth in the number of new cases per day, and the growth in the number of new tests per day, are very tightly correlated. This tight correlation suggests that if the United States were testing more people, we would probably still be seeing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. And combined with the high test-positivity rate, it suggests that the reservoir of unknown, uncounted cases of COVID-19 across the country is still very large.

Furthermore, Meyer and Madrigal report that the “test-positivity rate” for coronavirus cases in America is about 20 percent — much higher than countries like South Korea and Germany which have had more success bringing their coronavirus outbreaks under control. Since test-positivity rates generally fall along with the prevalence of a disease in a society, the US’s relatively high rate is another sign that it’s too early to declare victory over the coronavirus.

Trump might not want to acknowledge these issues, but his own administration has. As my colleague German Lopez explained on Wednesday, the testing and surveillance system outlined in an early version of the administration’s plan assumes the country will dramatically ramp up its testing capacity to make sure any outbreaks that occur before a vaccine is available are contained.

What the country needs to properly do testing, according to experts, is at least 500,000 tests a day. Some experts call for much more than that — millions or even tens of millions a day — but 500,000 a day is generally considered the minimum to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts. Right now, the US is, on a good day, doing about 150,000 tests a day, or fewer than a third of that minimum. The US’s poor pandemic preparedness, as well as Trump’s slow reaction to the coronavirus outbreak, has meant America is still massively undertesting.

To be clear, there are some states — such as Wyoming or Alaska — that still have fewer than 500 cases. For those places, it’s not crazy to think that some semblance of normal life could resume soon. But they aren’t out of the woods either — the lack of widespread testing means that if there’s an outbreak, it could spiral out of control before it’s even detected.

Ultimately, public health experts are in broad agreement that the US needs to significantly beef up its coronavirus testing infrastructure before it makes sense to talk broadly about reopening schools, restaurants, and offices in major population centers. But the US hasn’t made significant progress in that regard. And until it does, Trump’s declarations of victory amount to little more than rhetorical exercises.

The American public seems to generally understand this. New polling from the Pew Research Central shows that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

To advance his case that it’s appropriate to talk about reopening the American economy even while roughly 2,000 people in the country per day are dying from the coronavirus, Trump, characteristically, tried to turn that reality on its head on Thursday.

“America wants to be open. And Americans want to be open,” he said.

TRUMP: ""America wants to be open. And Americans want to be open.""

https://www.vox.com/,"Facebook just announced another step in trying to set the record straight about misleading information about the novel coronavirus on its platform. In the coming weeks, the company will start directing people who have previously “liked,” reacted, or commented on “harmful misinformation” about Covid-19 to information from more authoritative sources, such as a myth-busters website by the World Health Organization (WHO).

This represents one of the first times Facebook will warn a specific set of users who have interacted in the past with false information. Experts have argued for years that the social network is rife with misleading information that taints public discourse and asked Facebook to take the retroactive approach.

“We want to connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook,” wrote Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, in a company blog post released on Thursday. The notifications will apply only to Facebook and not its other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, social media users have been posting popular and dangerous hoaxes about the virus, including false cures and myths about the origins of the outbreak. In response, companies like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have been stepping up their measures to flag and sometimes delete this type of content. In March alone, Facebook says it labeled 40 million posts as “false” on its network, relying on its team of independent third-party fact-checkers. Still, plenty of bad information that fact-checkers don’t catch regularly slips through the cracks — or is caught only after tens of thousands of users have already seen the posts in question.

Facebook included a screenshot of a new News Feed message that will show users who have interacted false coronavirus information, pointing them to WHO resources.

The design Facebook provided looks more like a gentle nudge than a specific warning, and some have called for stronger notifications that specifically correct the record on individual false claims. When Recode asked about what the notifications will look like, a spokesperson for Facebook said the design in the blog post is an “early version” and that it’s also testing “more explicit” variations.

“We’ll continue to iterate on these designs with a goal of ensuring people who’ve been exposed to harmful misinformation about Covid-19 are connected with the facts,” said the spokesperson.

For Facebook’s critics, the move toward retroactively notifying users about misleading Covid-19 content, even if incremental, is a welcome development. Many academics and policy experts have scolded Facebook for lax moderation not only on Covid-related topics but also on misinformation around issues like immigration and politics. Historically, Facebook and other social media companies have been reluctant to flag politically contentious information as false, arguing that over-policing content on their platforms could limit free speech. But with the coronavirus, the company has adopted a more aggressive approach.

“[T]he company has taken a key first step in cleaning up the dangerous infodemic surrounding the coronavirus, but it has the power to do so much more to fully protect people from misinformation,” wrote Fadi Quran, campaign director at nonprofit activist group Avaaz, in a statement to Recode. Avaaz is one of several groups that has been pushing for stronger fact-checking and for corrections to be issued more broadly on the platform, not just on content about Covid-19. New research commissioned by the organization shows that Facebook corrections have a major impact in shaping users’ views and can effectively reduce people’s belief in misinformation by 50 percent.

Facebook declined to answer a question from Recode about whether it will apply its warnings to other types of misinformation in the future.

For companies like Facebook, it’s a lot easier to draw a line in the sand on misinformation about coronavirus topics than around more politically contentious ones, like gun rights, abortion, immigration, or even the 2020 US elections. While there’s still plenty of uncertainty about Covid-19 — even alleged biases of authoritative sources like the WHO have come under question — it’s still much easier to prove why a hoax about Covid-19 is wrong than it is to confirm the veracity of a personal attack on a politician.

In the next few weeks, we’ll learn more about what these new retroactive notifications to Facebook users that have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation will look like, not to mention how widely they’re being sent out. But it may take much longer before we see if Facebook’s new moderation strategy will be a lasting mechanism to fight misinformation online more broadly.

https://www.vox.com/,"As President Donald Trump pushes for the relaxation of social distancing guidelines and the resumption of something resembling pre-coronavirus social and economic activity, his supporters on Fox News are reaching for talking points to justify this course of action. A recent appearance on Hannity by Dr. Mehmet Oz illustrated how this search has run into significant moral roadblocks.

Dr. Oz — who got his start years ago on Oprah and has lately become a ubiquitous presence on Fox News, making daily appearances in which he regularly promotes unproven, dangerous drugs — made a case on Tuesday that reopening schools is “a very appetizing opportunity,” citing a study that he claimed showed doing so would only increase coronavirus deaths by 2 to 3 percent.

“Well, first, we need our mojo back. Let’s start with things that are really critical to the nation where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble,” Dr. Oz said. “I tell you, schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3 percent, in terms of total mortality. And, you know, any life is a life lost, but to get every child back into a school where they’re safely educated, being fed and making the most out of their lives, with a theoretical risk on the backside, it might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

DR OZ: ""Schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3%, in terms of total mortality. Any, you know, any life is a life lost, but ... that might be a tradeoff some folks would consider."" pic.twitter.com/aifMeKTsIv — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

(On Thursday evening, Dr. Oz posted a video on Twitter saying that “I’ve realized my comments on risks around opening schools have confused and upset people, which was never my intention. I misspoke.)

It should be noted that Dr. Oz misinterpreted The Lancet study he mentioned. What it actually details is a finding made by UK researchers that closing schools there without any other mitigation measures (such as social distancing) would reduce baseline Covid-19 deaths there by somewhere between 2 percent and 4 percent. The study does not speak to what impact the reopening of US schools would have on the coronavirus mortality rate here, so Oz’s analysis was confused. (Ironically, The Lancet’s underlying source is the very same WHO/Imperial College model that Fox News hosts have been trashing.)

That aside, Oz’s remarks come as the most-cited models now forecast the US will experience somewhere around 60,000 Covid-19-related deaths. (The total stands at over 33,000 as of today.) A 4 percent increase of that total represents an additional 2,400 lives. So what Dr. Oz was trying to say is that the prospect of that many additional deaths in exchange for the reopening of schools “might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

While there’s no study backing up the numbers Dr. Oz threw around, the fact he was so callous about more than 62,000 lives is instructive in its own right. It points toward what a chorus of right-wing voices seem willing to sacrifice in the hope of restoring a sense of normalcy.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus”

With a tough reelection campaign on the horizon and the economy he spent so much time boasting about during his first three years in office in ruins, Trump has self-interested reasons for wanting to get kids back to school and parents back to work. But the data indicates that from a public health standpoint, doing so at this point in time would be premature.

First of all, a quick look at the data shows that the US coronavirus curve hasn’t really flattened yet. Unlike countries like South Korea or Taiwan, the number of cases here continues to increase in something approximating an exponential manner.

Second, other countries that have had far less of a problem with the coronavirus, such as Germany, have just started to consider reopening schools — and schools that have reopened in Denmark, which recently became the first European country to take that step, have done so with new, strict social distancing rules. The idea that schools in a country where the coronavirus is currently killing 2,000 people a day (or more) are ready to reopen is out of step with reality.

Trump is looking for evidence — any evidence — to back his reopening position

As callous as they may be, Oz’s comments do reflect a talking point that’s gaining steam on the right as frustration has mounted with the social distancing measures (including school closures) that most Americans have endured for the past month.

On Wednesday, for instance, host Laura Ingraham pointed out that everything we do in life comes with some degree with risk, and used that observation to suggest continued social distancing measures represent government overreach.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus,” she said, in an observation similar to the one made by Dr. Oz.

Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson’s show featured him confronting Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) about the constitutionality of stay-at-home orders and an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) in which Kennedy said, “we gotta reopen, and when we do the coronavirus is gonna spread faster.”

“You know what kills more people every year than coronavirus — a lot more? Poverty,” Carlson replied, using a false equivalency Trump has also given voice to.

While it’s true that we’re all going to die someday, most people would rather it not happen in the short- to medium-term future because of a communicable disease whose spread we could slow if people would just stay home for the foreseeable future. In fact, new surveys from Gallup and Pew show that more people are afraid of lifting restrictions too quickly rather than keeping them around too long. Nor do we want our neighbors or their children’s teachers to meet their demise in that way.

One person’s statistic is another person’s mother or grandmother. Sacrificing thousands of lives in a misbegotten attempt to get back to normalcy is only an “appetizing opportunity” when you assume the lives lost aren’t your own or those of the people you love.

https://www.vox.com/,"The US Department of Labor registered 5.2 million initial unemployment insurance claims for the week ending April 11, bringing the total filings to 22 million since social distancing measures took effect in March — a pace of economic collapse so staggering that the Great Depression is the only comparison.

Last week’s claims slightly improved upon the 6.6 million initial claims the previous week, and the 6.9 million claims the week before that. But even if the peak of the joblessness wave seems to be behind us, the US is in uncharted waters. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the worst-ever initial claims number was about 700,000 job losses back in 1982.

Economists offer two caveats to this data. One is that the recently enacted CARES Act to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic expands the scope of unemployment insurance eligibility to cover more independent contractors and gig economy workers. So claims are surging, at least in part, because more people are eligible, making comparisons to past data slightly invalid.

At the same time, state UI systems — which are often built on obsolete code, starved of resources by state governments, and not designed to handle this volume of claims — have become overwhelmed, with people unable to get through on the phone or online. Consequently, the actual number of people trying to apply for assistance likely exceeds the numbers the country is seeing.

The official unemployment rate leapt from historic lows to 4.4 percent in March, according to official government data, but the numbers were based on a reference week that ended March 15, before the worst of the unemployment claims surge began.

That means the current jobless rate is almost certainly much worse than that — experts believe somewhere in the range of 12-15 percent, the worst on record since the Great Depression when unemployment reached 24 percent.

https://www.vox.com/,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

Part of the coronavirus conversation in the US is turning to the question of when to start reopening the country. President Donald Trump certainly wants to do it as soon as possible, based on the theory that the public is demanding to be let back out into restaurants and retail stores so they can resume a normal life.

But as of right now, that doesn’t appear to be true at all. Instead, Americans still seem onboard with social distancing and much more fearful about the health risks of opening up the country too soon than the economic risk of a continued shutdown. The costs of both have been awful — 31,000 dead and counting, 22 million jobs lost — but the public is first and foremost preoccupied with the public health crisis.

The Pew Research Center asked the question directly in a nearly 5,000-person survey conducted from April 7 to 12: Are you more worried about your state government lifting its restrictions on public activities too quickly or not quickly enough? By a 2-to-1 margin, Americans said that they were more worried about rapidly ramping down social distancing.

One likely explanation as to why there is such reluctance: Pew found 73 percent of Americans thought the worst was still to come in the coronavirus outbreak, while just 26 percent thought the worst had already happened.

Another piece of the puzzle may come from Gallup, which released its own polling on Thursday with a related finding: More Americans said they were worried about getting sick from Covid-19 than were worried about severe financial hardship because of the economic slowdown.

Gallup found that women, people who live in cities, and younger adults were most worried about the health risks.

Lower-income people saw the worst of both worlds: They were more concerned about getting sick than the people in higher income brackets and they were more fearful about economic hardships as well. As Vox’s Anna North recently reported, the ongoing pandemic has affected marginalized Americans the most, revealing the inequalities in US society in new and painful ways.

Starting to reopen society will require more testing, both to diagnose people currently infected and to identify people who’ve had the virus and recovered. We also need a better understanding of how immune people are after they fight off the virus. New applications to enable contact tracing will also help. And no matter what, it will be a slow journey back to normalcy; nobody should expect things to snap back to the way they were in the next few months. Normal life may not be able to fully resume until there is a vaccine widely available.

Opinions could, of course, change. Millions of people are now unemployed, and while Covid-19 is very infectious and can be dangerous to people of any age, it’s by far the most threatening to older people and people with preexisting conditions. The public’s calculus on health vs. economic risks might shift as lockdowns drag on, especially if officials can find ways to protect the most vulnerable.

But for the time being, this new polling indicates Americans are content with using social distancing to mitigate the health risks to themselves and their neighbors, even if it comes at an economic price.

https://www.vox.com/,"Wrongful convictions are so persistent in the US justice system — by some counts, over 2,600 innocent criminal defendants have been exonerated since 1989 — that at times they seem more like a feature than a bug. The Innocence Project, founded in 1992 by law professors Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and organizations within the Innocence Network are devoted to not only overturning wrongful convictions through DNA testing but also advocating for reform in the criminal justice system.

All of those numbers can feel pretty abstract, however. The new Netflix series The Innocence Files aims to translate the abstractions by showcasing the stories of real humans, people who went to jail for years or even decades based on evidence that fell apart when it was put under a microscope. In nine documentary episodes — some as long as a feature film — The Innocence Files draws on the same intriguing stories that often become the subjects of true crime series, while aiming to make a bigger point.

The nine episodes are grouped into three sections, each of which focuses on a broad aspect of America’s due process laws that might lead to wrongful convictions: evidence, witnesses, and prosecution. Each section uses real stories to illustrate the breakdown of supposedly just systems and the unreliability of allegedly unimpeachable evidence. For instance, the first three episodes, directed by Oscar-winning documentarian Roger Ross Williams, focus on two men who were wrongfully convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering young girls based on the largely disproven science of “bite-mark evidence.” The men, their families, jurors, members of law enforcement, and one particularly salty forensic odontologist who served as an expert witness all appear in the gripping story.

On the whole, The Innocence Files is among the strongest documentary series about criminal justice I’ve ever seen — both for its depth of research and the almost unbelievable nature of what it reveals about the American justice system’s intransigence in reversing wrongful convictions, even when it’s plainly obvious that something went awry.

The series harnesses the talents of a number of filmmakers, including three powerhouses in the documentary world: Williams, Oscar winner Alex Gibney, and Oscar nominee Liz Garbus. I recently spoke to all three by phone about their involvement in the project, the strangely optimistic nature of the series, and what they hope audiences will take away from The Innocence Files. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Alissa Wilkinson

Was there something in particular that drew each of you to this project?

Roger Ross Williams

Netflix approached me, and I had known about the work of the Innocence Project, obviously. I was a huge admirer of their work. I said yes right away. The reason is that I come from a community that is devastated by the mass incarceration crisis. I’m an African American man and I have family and friends behind bars, or who have been behind bars. This is very personal for me. The characters in my story come from a community that is poor, and a community that lives in fear that they’re going to end up in prison. And since one in every three black men at some point in their life end up incarcerated, that’s understandable. So this is very personal for me.

Liz Garbus

Netflix had done this overall agreement with the Innocence Project to open up their case files to filmmakers, and Netflix assembled us. I think all of us were immediately in because we’ve all, in different ways, been circling around themes around the criminal justice system for years in our careers.

The first film I made was in a prison — The Farm. I went in there knowing that I didn’t actually want to make a film about people who might be innocent there. I wanted to tell the stories of those who were not innocent, and grapple with the questions about incarceration: How much is too much, even if you have done the crime? That seemed to me a harder question in some ways, because, you know, you had people serving life and death sentences with no chance of ever stepping foot on free ground again, and dying in the prison hospital and being buried 10 feet from there and never leaving.

Inevitably, it turned out in The Farm there was a story of somebody who said they were innocent. But there was no DNA.

I was intellectually very satisfied with that approach to The Farm. But during my time filming in prison, I did get to meet several inmates who claimed they were railroaded, and that they were sitting there behind bars for 20 or 30 years and more for something that they didn’t do. The pain of that is so enormous. I made that film some two decades ago, and the questions are still hanging over all of us.

This project takes such a big swing. It’s able to address the systemic failures of a system that can rob people of their freedom and their lives. We don’t just look at it as if it’s one case that’s a miscarriage of justice. We look at it in a larger context. That felt really exciting to me, like an opportunity that I had not had before in any of the other films I had done on criminal justice, which were really always kind of story- and person-oriented. Here, we get to know the people and all of their stories. But working together, we get to talk about a whole system and its failures. That’s a really great opportunity.

Alex Gibney

I knew Peter [Neufeld] and Barry [Scheck] both, and was a huge admirer of them. So of course, they had me at “Innocence Project.” I’ve done a lot of films about power and abuses of power, and the idea of tackling prosecutorial misconduct seemed right.

But also, weirdly, having done a lot of films about pretty dark subject matter, I was interested in the injustice of it all, but also the whole idea of the Innocence Project working to get people released — I was looking for, even in a grim place, a kind of a happy ending.

I latched onto a story where the ending was uncertain. [Editor’s note: The focus of Gibney’s episode, Chester Hollman, was wrongfully convicted of second-degree murder based on faulty eyewitness testimony.] That was kind of a challenge. But at the same time, I wanted to follow along that path in a pale reflection of the man himself, who was hoping for some release. A kind of a happy ending that was important for me. The idea that these guys are really doing the job of getting people wrongly convicted released. That was a big boon for me.

Alissa Wilkinson

The episodes seem like they’d obviously appeal to people who are into true crime stories. But they’re also inspiring — not cheaply, but deservedly. We learn a lot about how hard the work of reversing wrongful convictions can be. Where did you find yourself inspired, or unexpectedly encouraged?

Alex Gibney

I’m inspired by watching the lawyers work. They are dedicated to trying to battle the legal system against all odds, because the legal system is rigged, in a way, against admitting mistakes. It’s a Sisyphean task for these lawyers to go up against the system that wants so desperately to attain some kind of certainty, even if that’s wrong. I was inspired by them and their dogged determination. In a number of the cases I dealt with, not only did you have the people in the Innocence Project, not only did you have defense attorneys, but you had volunteers who were giving tremendous amounts of their time to try to get this done over a period of sometimes five or 10 years. That was hugely inspiring.

Liz Garbus

It’s so important for people to understand what Alex was just saying. Once you spend time in a prison, you hear these stories about a public defender who slept through the trial, or didn’t show up. You say, “Couldn’t you get a new trial, or couldn’t you bring that up on appeal?” You hear these stories over and over.

But once there’s that original conviction, that decision on the record, it is so hard. Your presumption of innocence is gone. It is so hard to turn over. The system just clamps down and sucks you in. Think about the way poverty and race play into that. Who has decent representation to start with? Overcoming that original sin, that original error, is nearly impossible, and [the Innocence Project lawyers] know it. They’re really, truly heroic. They’re looking for that needle in the haystack — some judge, somewhere, who will grant some mercy — because it really is walking into a tsunami of energy directed toward keeping that conviction on the books.

Roger Ross Williams

What’s also amazing about someone like [Innocence Project attorneys] Peter [Neufeld] and Vanessa [Potkin]: They actually went to Mississippi, spent an incredible amount of time investigating this crime on the ground, and have an incredible bond with the exonerated individuals. I went back there to Mississippi with Peter to interview [exonerated former inmate] Levon Brooks. And their connection, their personal connection, was just so beautiful to see. Peter and Vanessa were not only in the courtroom; they were in the swamp. They performed a test on a pig to test the bite-mark evidence that was used in Levon’s case, to see if crawfish actually made the bite marks. They went to the window where the crime happened. They were active and engaged with these communities in a very deep and powerful and profound way.

Related False Positive

Alissa Wilkinson

It seems like there’s a special challenge in telling these stories via documentaries. You have to help the audience first understand why the juries were convinced by the case brought by prosecutors, and then you have to help them get past their biases to see why the wrongful conviction occurred. As storytellers, how do you construct narratives so they’ll grab viewers’ attention and keep it?

Alex Gibney

To some extent, I approached it as a crime story — except it’s a crime in reverse. We actually discover who was responsible, who committed the crime, or likely committed the crime, even as we begin to find Chester Hollman innocent.

But we also started the film with images of a prison and a disembodied voice of a man who’s talking on a prison phone to people on my team from the outside, slowly but surely telling his story. In that sense, he’s anonymous. He’s a number. He’s a disembodied voice at the end of the line. The structure of the film is really discovering his humanity. At the very end, you see him released, in the flesh, for the first time. That, I felt, was a powerful emotional structure for a film like this, that discovery of humanity in the course of understanding and revealing his story, and the fact that he’s actually free.

Liz Garbus

You want to set up a feeling of stakes and suspense, and have the story unfold with some of the mystery that viewers have come to know and love through true crime.

But what I love watching is something that helps me understand the underbelly of the system. How does it work? How do you get five teenagers to point the finger at this one guy who they didn’t really ever see at the scene of the crime? What is the process by which that happens?

The forensics of interactions between the psychology and police and potential witnesses. The manipulation and how that works. Yes, there’s the mystery: Did this guy do it? And if not, who did it, and what will happen to him? But there’s also just the forensics of these interactions and relationships. You see them like a slow-motion car wreck, a slow-motion accident, going off the rails, and you want to just scream and make it stop. I think that’s the drama of this as well.

Roger Ross Williams

While we interviewed all the lawyers and the experts, for me it was about placing the viewer in this community. The storytellers are only the characters who lived that moment. [My episodes] take you to a southern town in Mississippi, the birthplace of the Klan and the racial divide, and bring that to life and let the people of that community take you through what happened in real time. You’re totally immersed in a world that many viewers would never get to see — this world of poor, black, southern, rural America — and because our crew was all black, we allowed the subjects to be really honest and open about the struggle they were facing, and the reality of racism in their communities.

https://www.vox.com/,"As most governments around the world impose strict social distancing measures to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, Sweden has tried something quite different — and it’s unclear if it’ll prove successful or lead to more deaths.

For months, the Scandinavian nation allowed large gatherings to form, schools for younger children to remain open, restaurants to serve late-night guests, and resorts to welcome thrill-seeking skiers. Although some restrictions were in place and many people observed general safety and social distancing measures, Swedish health authorities felt it was better to have much of the country operating somewhat normally instead of shutting it all down.

On a theoretical scale of activity, where most countries brought it down to zero in the hope of quickly ramping up to 100 again, experts say Sweden has tried to keep the country at a simmer of 30 to manage the crisis for months to come.

“The reason given by Swedish authorities is about resilience,” Peter Lindgren, the managing director of the Swedish Institute for Health Economics, told me. “We may have to do this for a long time, and if you put all the heavy stuff in place at once, it will be quite difficult to maintain that. By having some measures in place and trying to be a bit more proportional, it’s possible to actually keep this under control.”

Sweden’s neighbors have taken a more aggressive approach during the Covid-19 outbreak. Denmark and Norway, for example, quickly closed their borders along with schools and industry to maximize social distancing. The chart below shows that those two countries have done better than Sweden in keeping the number of cases down.

There are sharp differences in COVD19 strategists between the Nordic countries. And also a distinct difference in results as measured in deaths. pic.twitter.com/Egw51K02Xk — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) April 16, 2020

But Swedish officials, and particularly chief state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, argue theirs is the right way forward. “Locking people up at home won’t work in the longer term. Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway,” Tegnell told reporters recently. He’s also repeatedly said it would be good for the Swedish population to gain immunity to the disease, though he’s flatly denied purposely seeking “herd immunity.”

Whatever the true goal, Sweden’s strategy appears to be troubled.

As of April 9, Sweden’s rate per capita of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus is higher than the rate of its fellow Scandinavian countries or the US. Hospitals are overcrowded and staff members are overworked, and the military has begun setting up field hospitals in major cities, including Stockholm, the country’s capital and the epicenter of its outbreak. The government is now seeking extraordinary powers to impose further restrictions.

Some experts I spoke to estimated that as many as 4 million Swedes — out of a population of around 10 million — may eventually contract the disease. And Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven stated this week that “thousands” in his country will die from Covid-19.

Experts note it’s still too early to tell if the Swedish government’s methods will prove successful in the end. But most Swedes I talked to said they’re unhappy being the world’s guinea pigs at such a dangerous time.

“I didn’t sign my informed consent for this experiment,” virologist Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér of the Karolinska Institute, a medical research center near Stockholm, told me. “I don’t know if [my family and I] can stay in a country that is not protecting its population.”

Many Swedes adopted social distancing. But not all of them.

As the outbreak started to hit Scandinavia, Norway restricted outdoor gatherings to no more than five people and encouraged those inside to keep 6 feet away from each other. Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to close its borders as it also shuttered schools and restaurants and limited outdoor groups to 10 or fewer.

Sweden’s government, by contrast, said it was okay for up to 500 people to meet outside. Schools for children 16 and younger would remain open, as would other establishments from restaurants to hair salons. And the government refused to close borders because, in Tegnell’s words last month, “We are not in the containment phase. We are in the mitigation phase,” because the virus had already hit the country.

The government was clear, though, that Swedes should adopt the usual social distancing measures to flatten the curve. And experts told me the population typically trusts what officials say and abides by their guidelines, allowing officials not to have to impose strict measures.

Top Swedish officials say that two-way trust is paying off. “It is a myth that life goes on as normal in Sweden. Many people stay at home and have stopped traveling,” Sweden’s Minister of Health and Social Affairs Lena Hallengren told me. “There is no full lockdown of Sweden, but many parts of the Swedish society have shut down.”

Hallengren offered some data points to make her case. Ridership on public transportation in Stockholm has dropped about 60 percent, she said. Nearly all domestic flights in Sweden have been canceled. All the major ski resorts in the country have closed voluntarily. And local media reports that 85 percent of people who’d planned to travel to Gotland, a popular Swedish vacation island, have canceled their trips ahead of Easter weekend.

Ludvig Beckman, a political scientist at Stockholm University, agreed with this general view. “A large majority are following the government’s advice,” he told me. “It’s pretty empty out there.”

Even critics of the government’s handling of the outbreak like Söderberg-Nauclér said that “it was a great thing from the beginning to trust people.” But, she noted, not everyone would reward Stockholm’s trust — and that’s where major problems have arisen.

Sweden’s lax coronavirus approach could put its people in danger

Knowing that events were capped at 500 people, organizers purposely sold 499 tickets to customers. Some older people, feeling little pressure from authorities, continued to go out into busy public squares. And bars, a central hangout spot for many young people in Stockholm, still served patrons deep into the night.

“Is it really that damn bad?” Sandra Bergkvist, a 28-year-old grocery clerk in Sweden, asked in an interview with the Washington Post this month while drinking beer with friends. “Of course we’re worried about people in the risk groups, but if it wasn’t for media it wouldn’t have been this hysterical.”

That nonchalance may have led to the country’s worsening coronavirus numbers.

The number of confirmed Swedish Covid-19 deaths has risen to more than 650, as of April 9. That brought the death rate per million in Sweden — Scandinavia’s biggest economy — to about 65. By comparison, Denmark’s rate was near 40 while Norway’s was near 20.

And Sweden’s numbers are likely to get even worse: One-third of all of Stockholm’s nursing homes have at least one case of the coronavirus.

In response, the government has taken some important steps, such as restricting gatherings at outside venues to 50 people and telling those at restaurants to sit only at tables, not stand crowded around the bar. It’s also seeking extraordinary powers to impose further measures, which could lead to forced closures of business, schools, airports, railways, and more. The military is also setting up a field hospital in a major conference center in the capital.

“The government is ready to adopt stricter measures to combat the virus whenever we consider it necessary,” Hallengren said.

But virologist Söderberg-Nauclér isn’t buying it: “It’s too late to try and stop” a larger outbreak, she told me.

Which means many Swedes are now potentially at risk of contracting the deadly virus who wouldn’t have been had the government imposed these measures much sooner.

Sweden’s health care system was better prepared than most for a major outbreak

Estimates vary among experts I spoke to, but the country’s health system likely has had somewhere between 500 and 1,000 beds available in hospital intensive care units. This follows a quick ramp-up from the government and lots of funding for a universal health system that’s considered top-tier worldwide, with well-trained physicians.

According to Lindgren of the Swedish Institute of Health Economics, hospitals typically have enough equipment for 48 hours should no shipments of protective equipment like masks arrive. However, he said, the national government has been good about buying and distributing materials to caregivers when needed.

And while physicians are overworked as cases increase, Lindgren said, the number of new admissions to intensive care units over the past two weeks has remained flat, at around 30 to 40 people per day.

Critics, though, note that recent reforms to the nation’s health care system led to an unnecessary shortage in the stockpile of protective materials before the crisis and lower capacity at hospitals.

So Sweden may be better off than most, but it could struggle to deal with a rapid uptick in coronavirus cases like many other countries.

Sweden’s Public Health Agency has a lot of autonomy. That worries some people.

Still, many Swedes see no need to panic. “I think our government is doing the right thing,” Margareta Eriksson, a retired 67-year-old in Stockholm, told the Washington Post this week.

That sense of security comes partly from widespread trust in the Public Health Agency. It’s a mostly independent organization that takes the lead during major public health crises like disease outbreaks and is heavily protected from political interference.

No government minister actually oversees the agency, which gives Tegnell, the government’s chief epidemiologist and response coordinator, a lot of room to make decisions as he sees fit.

“There’s cause for a [government] minister to get sacked if they interfere” with independent public bodies, Lindgren told me. “The scandals that get reported here are when ministers try to place undue influence on the experts.”

That became clear during my interview with Health Minister Hallengren, who said the government defers to the agency on a lot.

For instance, “the government relies on advice from the Swedish Public Health Agency regarding school closures,” she told me. “If the Swedish Public Health Agency makes the assessment that all schools in Sweden should close in order to fight the spread of Covid-19, the government is prepared to do so” after coordinating between the two sets of authorities.

That all seems good on the surface. During a medical crisis — especially one as large as the coronavirus outbreak — it’s important for politicians to step aside and let the experts lead the way. But that only works if the experts offer sound advice, and it’s not clear Tegnell is.

Critics say he’s trying to have the country develop herd immunity, a controversial approach that aims to have many millions contract the disease so the wider population is resistant to infection down the line. It’s an idea that seemed to take hold in governments in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands — before models showing such a policy would merely lead to more deaths led them to change course.

Tegnell firmly denies that developing herd immunity in Sweden is his goal, but he has told reporters it’s “not contradictory” to his aims, either. Stockholm University’s Beckman noted that Tegnell recently said Sweden only has two options: Either everyone gets vaccinated or the country develops herd immunity.

It’s comments like these that make the Karolinska Institute’s Söderberg-Nauclér deeply skeptical of the government’s aims. She and more than 2,000 other academics and experts signed a petition requesting that the government pursue a different strategy. “It’s my responsibility as a scientist” to call them out, she told me. “I don’t trust authorities. I trust data.”

The virus measures around 100 nanometers, and the smallest wavelengths of light that humans can see measure around 400 nanometers. To see something that small, you need a device that uses smaller wavelengths than light. To accomplish this, an electron microscope accelerates electrons in a field until they behave as a tiny wavelength.

Two electron microscopy techniques, SEM and TEM, offer different views. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) scans the surface of a sample and records information that bounces back, similar to a satellite image. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) transmits electrons through a sample and projects a cross-section of its inner structure. Together, these images help scientists observe the virus and how it moves in and out of host cells.

https://www.vox.com/,"On July 21, 1969, the Apollo 11 quarantine began.

As shown in the video above, it was an unusual process for an unprecedented task: keeping potential moon germs from entering the Earth’s atmosphere (and affecting its population).

To isolate the Apollo astronauts from Earth, NASA went to extraordinary lengths, clothing them in “biological isolation garments,” transporting them on a converted Airstream trailer, and quarantining them for weeks in a Lunar Receiving Lab built specially for analyzing moon samples — and, of course, for holding the men who went there.

The quarantine was a strange capstone to the journey to the moon — but a necessary one that’s surprisingly resonant today.

https://www.vox.com/,"Millions of newly laid-off Americans are now wondering how to access government unemployment benefits as they scramble to cover rent, groceries, and other daily necessities. Vox is here to help readers navigate the bureaucracy.

Congress has significantly expanded unemployment insurance as part of its historic $2 trillion CARES Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump. Laid-off or furloughed Americans who file for unemployment through their states will see an extra $600 per week added on to that existing state benefit. The average benefit in the US is about $385 per week, but some states are more generous than others.

There are a few key things to know about this new law, as my colleague Dylan Matthews recently explained. First and foremost, it adds $600 to every weekly unemployment check. Second, more people now qualify for unemployment insurance than before. The law creates a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for freelancers, independent contractors, or gig economy workers who previously were ineligible for unemployment insurance. The law also makes benefits easier to access by waiving some states’ requirements for people to look for work. These programs will provide people the increased assistance for four months — late March until July. And with many states still setting up their Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs, benefits will be paid out retroactively. That means even if workers can’t apply for benefits until May, they will ultimately still receive what they are owed from the time they were laid off.

“The UI provisions in the CARES Act were some of — if not the — strongest provisions of the act,” said labor economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute and formerly part of the Obama administration. “It will alleviate the hardship of millions of people.”

People who have already filed for regular unemployment benefits because they were laid off from a job should be starting to see the expanded benefit show up in their checks in the coming weeks. The process could be a bit more complex for contract or self-employed workers who need to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and are waiting for states to set up these programs.

But because so many people are filing for unemployment all at once, it is causing frustrating delays. Many are experiencing jammed phone lines, and many state unemployment websites have crashed with the high demand, including states like New York, Florida, and Michigan.

“The system’s a little clogged up right now,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. “People should keep trying.” Evermore noted that even if some workers are being told they’re not eligible immediately, that could change in the coming weeks as states start receiving the federal money and set up the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.

“The states need resources in order to administer the UI,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Vox recently. “Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable. So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this.”

Vox crowdsourced common questions from readers and contacted experts to answer them. Here’s our guide on how to access unemployment benefits, who is covered, and much more.

Your unemployment insurance questions, answered

How much does my state offer in base unemployment benefits? And where do I apply?

Here’s a chart that shows each state’s minimum and maximum weekly unemployment benefit, as well as a link to each state’s unemployment office. People can apply online or over the phone, though many states are recommending online applications due to busy phone lines.

Each state has its own guidance, but due to high demand, some states are advising people to call on certain days or at certain times depending on the alphabetical order of their last names or order of their Social Security numbers. Check your state’s website to find out if there are specific guidelines.

Who qualifies for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

The CARES Act opened up unemployment benefits to a range of people who weren’t eligible before, including gig economy workers like drivers for Uber or Lyft, freelancers, and independent contractors. Part-time employees who lost their jobs due to coronavirus will also be covered, as will people who had to stop working to take care of a sick member of their family or homeschool their children.

Bottom line: If coronavirus is responsible for your layoff, furlough, or drastic reduction of your hours — or is preventing you from looking for work because fewer employers are hiring — you have a good chance of getting these expanded benefits. It’s worth applying even if you are unsure if you’ll be covered.

Who doesn’t qualify for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

People who are working from home but still getting a full wage are not eligible for benefits. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible; neither are new entrants into the workforce, like recent college graduates, because they don’t have a long enough work history to apply for benefits.

What documentation do I need to sign up for unemployment insurance?

States ask for some basic information during the application process, including:

Your name, birthdate, and Social Security number

Your last employer’s information, including company name, supervisor’s name, address, and phone number

The last date you worked and the reason you are no longer working

Your gross earnings in the last week you worked (starting Sunday and ending with your last day on the job)

You may also be asked about other employers you worked for in the past 18 months, including the employer name, address, dates of employment, gross wages earned, hours worked per week and hourly rate of pay, and the reason you are no longer working.

This means keeping documentation about your previous income and wages is key. This information can be found on your W-2s, paystubs, or invoices if you are a freelancer or independent contractor.

When will the extra $600 show up in my unemployment check?

This will vary state by state, but the extra money should start appearing soon — likely by next week for people who are already in their state system, but longer for those still waiting for their applications to go through. It takes time for the US Department of Labor to coordinate with state unemployment agencies to get the money flowing. It will likely be longer for freelancers and independent contractors to get the benefit because they are waiting for the government to set up an entirely new program.

“The $600 with existing benefits, people should be in a position to get that within 3 weeks,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. “The disaster benefits, they’re going to take a little time to develop the intake.”

How much could I get over four months? And what happens if there’s a delay in getting the extra money?

All told, the extra $600 per week will add up to around an extra $10,000 over four months. If there is a delay in it showing up in people’s paychecks (which there likely will be), people will be getting retroactive pay in their first paychecks to make up for the lag time.

“That is a way to get a lot more money to people who really need it,” said Stettner. “It has the ability to prevent some of the real damaging parts of unemployment: reducing your savings, food security, having trouble maintaining your housing”

What’s the difference between being furloughed and being laid off? Do furloughed employees qualify for the expanded unemployment insurance program?

Unlike a more permanent layoff, a furlough is a temporary period of unemployment — with a promise that the employee will return to work when economic conditions improve. But the big difference here is that while furloughed employees forgo their wages, they keep other benefits like health insurance. Employees who have been furloughed due to coronavirus will be eligible for expanded unemployment insurance.

What’s the process for gig economy workers or independent contractors?

Freelancers, gig economy workers, and independent contractors will file for unemployment insurance from a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which is still being set up by the Labor Department and states and could take longer to be ready in some states (Washington state, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania have announced their programs will be ready to take applications by the end of April). When the program is available, it can be accessed on state unemployment websites where people apply for regular UI. Check your state’s website for guidance on when and how you should apply, if you fall into this category.

“Gig workers will need to file for PUA first, and then they will get the $600,” said Stettner. “This is the new program part of the law and will take the longest to set up — the pandemic program for gig workers et al.”

What documentation do freelancers or independent contractors who rely on invoices or cash need to prepare to get benefits?

Keeping documentation about your previous income and wages as a freelancer, independent contractor, or self-employed worker is important and will help you when filing for unemployment. Keep documentation both about how you get your money and how much you have been paid per month in the past (old tax returns and invoices are good examples).

“Whatever documentation they have about how they get their money would be helpful,” Evermore added. If people are lacking documentation, they can file good-faith attestations about their wages to unemployment offices, but documents are preferred.

If I’m working two-part time jobs and lose one, can I get benefits for the lost job while still working the other?

Though part-time workers are eligible for expanded benefits, the answer to this question depends on whether the weekly earnings from the second job erase the partial benefit credit you’d get from unemployment, Stettner said.

“In simplest terms, the closer the pay of the second part-time job they have is ... to the first part-time job they lost, the less likely they are to get benefits. The bigger the difference, the more likely to get benefits,” he said.

What if I just got a job offer that is now rescinded or up in the air due to coronavirus?

Again, you are eligible for the expanded unemployment benefits. Having documentation here is also important if you can get it; for instance, having both your offer and a written statement rescinding or postponing that offer that you can send to your state’s unemployment office can be helpful when filing for unemployment.

“However you found your offer was rescinded, keep that handy,” Evermore said.

What if I was unemployed prior to the crisis and am having no luck finding jobs? Can I apply for benefits even if my old benefits ran out?

Yes. Anyone who has exhausted their regular unemployment insurance can get a 13-week extension on their benefits. Once that extension is exhausted, workers can apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Evermore said. “That can go up to 39 weeks total,” she added.

What is the situation for new or soon-to-be college graduates who can’t find a job?

People who are a few months away from graduating college and looking for jobs are in more of a bind because of their limited work history.

There’s a provision in a recently released bill from House Democrats that would allow recent college graduates to qualify for something called a “job seekers allowance,” about half of the benefits available for the rest of workers. But unless Congress passes a provision to allow this, recent college graduates are in a tough spot.

What about employees in houses of worship, including ministers, rabbis, or imams?

In many states, congregations don’t pay unemployment insurance and employees aren’t eligible for unemployment. So unless the specific employer has decided to voluntarily participate in unemployment insurance, employees of churches, synagogues or mosques likely won’t be eligible in most states.

However, Stettner and Evermore said it depends on how the US Department of Labor interprets the language of the CARES Act. If the new pandemic program is treated like a standard disaster relief program, church, synagogue, and mosque employees could be covered — but that won’t be determined until Labor provides more information about how the program is being implemented.

https://www.vox.com/,"Americans don’t trust the government, and they don’t trust the media. That trend has been evident for years, but the Trump era has accelerated it.

Now we can see the worst-case scenario that trend could create, playing out in front of our eyes: Confronted with a paralyzing coronavirus pandemic, there’s deep confusion about the steps the country should be taking to respond.

Don’t expect it to get better, says journalism critic Jay Rosen. That’s in large part because the Trump administration uses confusion as one of its primary political tools. Right now, it is employing it to create cover for the president, who wants to argue that he shouldn’t be blamed for a litany of missteps as the virus moved from China to the US and exploded across the country.

“The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history”

“The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history,” he told me recently. “The Republican Party and the Trump campaign and the MAGA coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.”

That conflict is unfolding in plain sight: The point of that weird campaign video Trump rolled out at a White House press conference this week was to recast himself as bold and decisive in the face of the pandemic — as opposed to convincing reports in the New York Times, Washington Post, and other outlets emerging recently that portray him and his administration as dithering and confused, and slow to make crucial decisions like telling the country to start socially distancing.

It’s an extension of the challenge Trump has posed to journalists from the start of his administration, when he ordered his then-press secretary, Sean Spicer, to tell the press that his inauguration had an enormous audience instead of a paltry one. Or, in Trump’s words, delivered to a group of veterans in 2018: “Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.”

Rosen, who teaches journalism at New York University, has been meeting up with me once a year to discuss the challenges the Trump administration poses for the media. This year, instead of a podcast, we chatted via Skype, and I’m presenting edited excerpts of that conversation below.

If you read the story I wrote earlier this week about the media’s struggles to report on the pandemic, you’ll recognize similar themes in this conversation, which was happening while I was reporting that story; I’m grateful to Rosen for the opportunity to shape my thinking.

The Trump-era information gap

Peter Kafka

There’s a giant gap in the way the American public perceives or has perceived the pandemic. That split is both across political divides and across news consumption divides. Are you surprised in any way to see what we’re seeing today?

Jay Rosen

No.

Peter Kafka

We have talked about this sort of gap for several years. But did you imagine that this would manifest in a literal life-and-death crisis like this?

Jay Rosen

No, I never imagined a crisis like this. I did, like lots of other people, worry about what would happen in a truly serious event, combined with the Trump presidency. But I was thinking a war, a terrorist attack, a natural disaster of epic proportion, something like that.

But something like this, which affects everyone and is invisible and takes both science and imagination to understand — which I think is a very interesting point for us to discuss — I never conceived of something like this.

Peter Kafka

There have been many failures. I think one of them, for a lot of people — and I include myself here — is a failure of imagination, a failure to see this coming, even though people have literally made books and movies about this for years.

Jay Rosen

This possibility was talked about a lot. And warnings for the virus began early, and so there was plenty of information that it was going to become important.

But what I meant by imagination is something additional to that, which is: In order to understand what is happening now, in order to be informed, you need not only good information, reliable information, but you need imagination to see what it is.

Peter Kafka

Imagination buttressed with science ...

Jay Rosen

Yeah. That’s why [Dr. Anthony] Fauci and others say if it sounds like it’s too much, it’s just enough.

But it’s an incredibly difficult thing to tell people about, because unlike a hurricane or even a war, [the virus] is completely abstract. So that’s one of the challenges that journalists faced.

Peter Kafka

Right. You can’t see it until you either have it or you’re looking at someone who has it. Even now, one of the things that strikes me — and you see this manifesting on Twitter — is that even now when there are [thousands] of people who have died, because so much of it is happening in a hospital, or in someone’s house or en route to the hospital, that you’re not seeing it.

And while there’s plenty of reporting from inside hospitals ... in terms of visuals, you’re still not seeing it. And so you end up with scenes like people on Twitter saying they’re going to the Elmhurst Hospital in Queens to see if they can see these lines with people.

Jay Rosen

That’s a whole meme now — go to your hospital and take video of nothing happening so that you can own the libs.

Confusion and doubt as a strategy

Peter Kafka

Are you tracking the percentage of people who say they are worried [or] not worried, and how that’s evolving over time and what their sources of information are? It seems like it has changed over time, in part because at various times the president has said this is a serious thing, after saying it was not a serious thing.

Jay Rosen

Yeah. And this coheres with political science findings from long ago, that public opinion does follow what political leaders and party leaders are saying.

The recognition that there’s a reality there, that this thing is happening, it’s real, it’s not a story, it’s not a fake — I think that has grown. But as that has grown, so has the attempt to escape responsibility for that.

And I think this is a really important point that I’ve been trying to make: The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history. Because so much of it is public. We have so many statements from Trump minimizing the danger. So many things are already on the record.

The Republican Party and the Trump campaign and the MAGA coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. And that, of course, is going to be a huge challenge for the press.

But it’s much more than the press: I think the fight to interpret what happened in those first three months as someone else’s fault and to persuade Americans that it wasn’t Trump’s responsibility — when there are so many things on the record, like “giving myself a 10 out of 10” or “this is going to go away, it’ll just magically disappear.” All those things are going to have to be overridden somehow. And that is going to put a huge strain on the information system.

“The key for the Trump campaign is to create confusion, not belief. And that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead — is the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record.”

Peter Kafka

In the pre-Trump era, any politician, let alone the president, who not only said this once but downplayed the virus multiples times — made a whole series of statements that were then not rebutted but actually refuted — that would be the end of the story. Right? It’s all on tape. We know what it is. There’s no doubt about it. There’s no debate.

In the Trump era, sadly, we’ve become used to the idea that Trump can say something on live TV in front of everyone and then is actually able to make it go away, magically. And that there is a significant chunk of the population that either will never hear it or refuse to believe it or doesn’t care.

So you’re describing a fight to come. But it seems like in some ways, this won’t be a fight: Both sides will already be resigned to either believe Trump or not believe Trump. Is there any reason to believe it’s different this time?

Jay Rosen

I think that’s a little oversimplified.

The Trump base will believe anything that he believes, and there’s already polling data indicating that his core supporters trust Trump as a source of information far more than they trust the news media or any other institution. So for that group, yes.

Then, of course, there’s a large group of Trump doubters, who are also, not coincidentally, more likely to think that the mainstream media can be trusted as a source of information.

But there are people who are in neither of those camps. I wouldn’t call them centrist. I wouldn’t try to characterize their ideology. But they’re not in either one of those camps. And for those people, the key for the Trump campaign is to create confusion, not belief. And that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead: the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record.

One side says this. The other side says that. I can’t make up my mind; I’m going to either ignore it or shrug my shoulders.

Jay Rosen

Yeah, it’s already happening. Like, [New York City Mayor] Bill de Blasio does not have a great record in himself and warning his public. He went to the gym way after it was too dangerous to do that. And so there is some responsibility there, right? Compared to Trump’s responsibility, it’s, you know, small. But it’s real.

That kind of fact is going to interact with on the one hand/on the other hand journalism. And they’re going to try and, of course, blow that up.

Another thing that has already started happening is people keep sending me this graphic. I don’t know who created it, but I’ll send it to you. That is all the headlines from various sources that minimized the virus, that said it’s not going to be that big of a deal — some similar things to what Trump said.

The attempt is to say that it was the “MSM” — a term I don’t use, but they do — it was the mainstream media that misled us.

Why didn’t the media do better?

Peter Kafka

I did want to ask you about that. Do you think the mainstream media — I’ll use the term — could have done a better job of raising the alarm earlier?

Jay Rosen

Probably, yes. As with other very big crises, like the 2008 economic crisis, you can go back and you can find reports that gave the appropriate warnings. But the overall tone of the coverage did not accomplish that.

I think the same thing will be true here. There are definitely reports — quite a few — that said this thing is bigger than the political system seems to be acknowledging. And then even before this particular virus arose, the possibility of a global virus like this, having this kind of effect, was very well known and discussed quite a bit.

So there is some responsibility there from the news media. But the news media of course isn’t one organism.

“If the president and the White House [were] hair on fire about this, there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type”

Peter Kafka

I’ve been thinking about this for a while. I think there are probably two different reasons that the media, broadly, was not more alarmist about this. One is a sincere desire not to be alarmist — in general, and specifically over a health crisis. If you’re telling people this is going to be terrible, and you quote people who are stocking up on food, you can have a run on markets.

Jay Rosen

I think it would be part of the reason that you didn’t see kind of a “Time out, nothing else matters. Pay attention to this.” That would be one reason.

But another way to look at it would be if the president and the White House [were] hair on fire about this, there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type. So that’s a factor as well.

There’s a lot of resistance to reporting on something that is a possibility.

Peter Kafka

But the other thing is that for many journalists, this reporting involved going to health experts — often the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or the WHO [World Health Organization], or people like that — and saying, “What should we think about this?” and then reporting what they say.

Now we’re seeing that, in some cases, those institutions themselves were behind in sounding the alarm, being more vocal about the alarm, and some of their advice and prognostications have changed.

And it seems like that would pose a real challenge if you are a good reporter, and you go to what is supposedly a nonpartisan institution staffed with experts, and they’re saying this is our view — that it’d be very hard for you to run against that.

Jay Rosen

I agree with that. Journalism scholars say that news reporters are dependent on “authorized knowers.” This would be a very good example of that. When the authorized knowers aren’t making a big deal of something, it’s extremely difficult for journalists to do that.

“News” is a fundamental problem for the news

Peter Kafka

What do you make of the Ben Thompson argument that this is why Twitter was particularly valuable? Because you had all sorts of experts on Twitter — sometimes they weren’t sanctioned by the CDC, sometimes they were smart people in Silicon Valley — and they’ve had insight and we should have listened to them more than the CDC or the WHO at various points?

Jay Rosen

Well, if the question is the availability of information that warned us that this was coming — yes, that information was available. And you could find it in part by doing your own research. That’s true.

But the problem is not really the availability of good information that turned out to be right and important. It’s the combination of good information and public attention.

Peter Kafka

Which is kind of the job of the media. To contextualize that information and to put it out.

Jay Rosen

Yes, and to order things. This is one of the problems we have with our news system. The news tends to be, to use a colloquial expression, “one damn thing after another.” And what it’s not that good at — even though people say that front pages do this — it’s not that good at helping us organize stories in order of priority.

Like telling us what’s most important to worry about. And next most important, and maybe third or fourth. And keeping those priorities both stable, in the sense that they don’t change day to day, but also be able to evolve as big events evolve. We don’t really have anything like that. And so it tends to be one damn thing after another.

If you just think about producing today’s news, then a sense of hierarchy, a sense of relative importance, disappears from the flow of content. This is a big problem with our news system. It’s not the fault of any one journalist or any one news organization. It’s a problem with relying on news for our knowledge.

Peter Kafka

But there are hierarchies. There’s the top of the newscast. If you know how to interpret the New York Times, you know that the story on the far right is the most important even though it may be under a smaller headline than the rest of the page. That is part of the job of media, right? Packaging that and ordering it?

Jay Rosen

Yes. But that tends to be a little bit different than what I said. That’s “here’s the most important new thing that happened today.”

But some things are not new, but they are the most important thing. So some things are persistent and still the most important thing today. And when you have things like that, where actually the news of the day doesn’t change the fact that you should be worried about X, Y, and Z first — that’s where the system breaks down.

Does this get better?

Peter Kafka

I want to come back to the original idea here that I had when I was talking to you, which was: Is there anything we can do about a partisan divide and a news source divide that is now literally a life-and-death situation? Is there any practical solution to this problem today in 2020?

Jay Rosen

Well, as the reality of the virus grows and everyday life is affected and people have extremely practical questions like, “What do I do? How do I protect my family?” the news at the local level becomes extremely important because people need to know where to go, what to do.

So it’s possible that local news providers will experience kind of a rebirth of both use and trust from the many questions and crises that arise from this situation.

And a relationship with a local news provider is basic to how people develop trust in journalism and in the news media as an institution. And so if people’s connection to local news providers is strengthened by this — which does happen sometimes in civic emergencies, like hurricanes, for example — that could change things a little bit.

I don’t think it’s going to change opinion at the level of Fox versus NBC and Trump versus Jonathan Karl. It doesn’t touch that. But reestablishing trust and utility with local publics could help journalism quite a lot.

Peter Kafka

That would be great. And it would be great if we have local news outlets that are still around to perform that function.

Jay Rosen

Well, this is part of the problem. Those newsrooms are themselves impoverished. And so it makes it extremely difficult.

https://www.vox.com/,"Apple and Google are a month away from launching a series of updates to their smartphone operating systems that will use Bluetooth signals to track potential coronavirus cases. This week, the companies confirmed to Recode that the contact-tracing technology will go away when the pandemic does, which should assuage some privacy concerns. But as two of the world’s tech superpowers prepare to embed new surveillance features into their devices, skepticism mounts. Will Apple and Google’s joint effort to fight the virus have unintended consequences?

When the contact-tracing tool was announced, there was no indication that the software required to make it work would be temporary. That it involved changes to mobile operating systems actually made it seem more likely that it would be a permanent fixture. Apple and Google have said this deep integration was the only way to enable the nonstop tracking necessary for the contact-tracing tool to function properly. Nevertheless, the permanency of such a tool could lead to its features being used for other purposes, once its intended use was no longer needed. So it seems to be a relief that Apple and Google plan to sunset the contact-tracing tool at the end of the pandemic, though details about exactly which software features will go away and what qualifies as the “end of the pandemic” still need to be explained.

By promising an expiration date, Apple and Google have addressed a chief concern for privacy advocates, some of whom have been uncharacteristically amenable to certain types of tracking during the pandemic. But many more questions remain. How will Apple and Google prevent their tool from being abused by governments with access to it? How will the companies ensure that contact-tracing systems remain optional for smartphone users? Will the tool be effective enough to warrant the privacy compromises it requires?

“This is an extraordinary time,” Bennett Cyphers, staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Recode before the time limit was announced. “It means that we would accept some pretty extraordinary things that EFF would normally never endorse. But that has to come with some kind of limit on how it can be used and for how long it can be used.”

Although they seem to have answered the “how long” question, Apple and Google have so far provided limited information about the tool itself. The companies have released some technical documents showing how the system works, and they’ve answered a few questions from the media. But that’s about it. Beyond confirming that the tool would end, neither Apple nor Google has responded to Recode’s requests for comment.

The tool could leave a dangerous door open

The new Apple-Google tool sounds miraculous at first blush. Starting in mid-May, the companies plan to release software updates that will allow iOS and Android phones to exchange anonymized keys through Bluetooth to any other phones that come within a certain proximity. These feature will enable interoperability between iOS and Android phones, and public health authorities will exclusively build apps based on an application programming interface (API) built by Apple and Google. If a user tests positive for coronavirus, they will inform the app, which will then alert people who have been close enough to the infected person for their phones to exchange Bluetooth keys. The alert will tell them they’ve been in contact with an infected person, without revealing the person’s identity.

Although this talk of tracking and tracing might sound daunting, the Apple-Google tool includes specific privacy protections, such as using anonymized keys that change every 15 minutes to prevent anyone from tracing a specific key back to an individual; storing data on users’ devices rather than on a central server; using proximity detection instead of location data; and making the entire program opt-in. Apple and Google have said privacy and user trust was at the forefront of their collective minds when developing the tool.

Not everyone believes these good intentions can hold. Apple and Google’s privacy promises ring hollow to people who have seen how both companies have built themselves on the back of privacy compromises, many of which were made without the consumer’s knowledge.

“Two corporations, Apple and Google, have come to dominate the smartphone software ecosystem, and they have spent years spying on users and enabling consumer surveillance in their app stores,” Michael Kwet, a visiting fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project, told Recode. “In the world we built, we now have to weigh the fate of our lives and economy against trust in Apple and Google, the ad-tech industry they support, and government intelligence agencies. … This is a nightmare.”

Just look at how well the tools hidden in many apps available through Apple and Google marketplaces can track you. And Google has trackers installed all over the internet, gathering first- and third-party data about potentially everything you do online. One way or another, everyone from location-data brokers to law enforcement can get access to a lot of your data through these companies’ devices. Apple and Google have made several efforts to combat some of these intrusions, but such intervention only shows that the companies can’t foresee all of the unintended consequences their innovations may have. They can only respond to them after the fact.

We also don’t yet know which countries, states, or cities will be participating in the Apple-Google contact-tracing effort. We do know that the API will be made available only to those governments’ public health authorities, though it’s unclear if the companies will take measures to prevent authoritarian governments from using the technology in unintended ways.

Along those lines, while users must opt-in to the contact-tracing feature, we don’t know if health authorities will be able build apps on top of the Apple-Google technology that could enable more invasive tracking. We’ve already seen systems like this in other parts of the world. The Chinese government, for example, made an app that assigns a health code to users, who must then show a healthy code in order to move around freely. The Apple-Google tool doesn’t do this, but it could be used to perform a similar function.

“I think there’s a very real possibility that businesses could, for example, require that their employees show proof of ‘non-infection’ before they’re permitted to return to work — voluntarily, of course,” Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist who has written about privacy issues and Bluetooth tracking, told Recode.

Soltani also wondered what Apple and Google will do to prevent developers from adding identifiers in the apps they build using the contact-tracing API, such as location information and names.

On Thursday, the European Union released a list of privacy requirements for member states developing contact-tracing apps, suggesting the EU has some privacy concerns with regard to the Apple-Google tool. On the list is “urgent engagement with owners of the mobile operating systems” to ensure that the tool is “compatible with the EU common approach.” Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service was reportedly looking into ways to identify supposedly anonymous users of the contact-tracing app it is developing. The NHS plans to integrate the Apple-Google tool into that app, according to the BBC.

It’s not inconceivable that something like this could happen in the United States, where there are already instances of public health authorities sharing positive coronavirus tests with the police. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, an advocate of data-privacy legislation, said in a statement that he “urgently want[ed] to know how Apple and Google will assure that consumers’ privacy interests are strongly balanced with the legitimate needs of public health officials during the coronavirus pandemic,” adding that “a public health crisis cannot be a pretense to pave over our privacy laws or legitimize tech companies’ intrusive data collection about American’s personal lives.”

Bluetooth technology may not be up to the job

Privacy and security are chief among the concerns with the Apple-Google tool, but there are also issues with the technology itself. While more precise than GPS, Bluetooth signals may not be good enough to determine the proximity of other devices with the accuracy needed for contact tracing. The precision of these signals can depend on several factors, but some estimates suggest the technology could struggle with the 6-foot social distancing recommendation. If a Bluetooth signal can only determine your location to within 30 feet, for example, you’d get a notification that you were in proximity to an infected person when you might actually be at a safe distance. (Exactly how far the coronavirus can travel in the air remains unclear.) These false positives could happen in a densely populated location with such frequency that they become meaningless.

Bluetooth signals can also travel through physical barriers, so the Apple-Google contact-tracing tool might get mixed up if there’s a wall between two devices. That means you could get a notification about being exposed to the coronavirus when, in reality, you and the other person are in two separate apartments. The opposite could also be true: You might not get a notification when you have been exposed in a way the Bluetooth-based system didn’t register.

“The false negatives are the ones that concern me more,” Susan Landau, a cybersecurity and policy professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Recode.

False negatives could happen in many different ways. The infected person might not use the tool, or they may not have their phone on them when they came near you. Or someone with the virus might sneeze or cough more than 6 feet away from you. They wouldn’t trigger the proximity alert, but you still could have been exposed. Meanwhile, if this data is then used by governments to justify lifting shelter-in-place ordinances, any inaccuracies could be very costly.

“It’s essentially going to give us a false sense of safety while simultaneously infringing on people’s rights,” Soltani said.

Voluntary participation may not be enough

Finally, assuming the privacy issues don’t lead to any sinister outcomes and the Bluetooth technology pulls through, the Apple-Google contact-tracing tool might fail due to statistics. There’s the minimum percentage of the population that will have to participate in digital contact tracing in order for it to be effective. An Oxford University study puts the minimum at about 60 percent. And while having it integrated into the vast majority of smartphone operating systems — an estimated 3 billion people worldwide own an Apple or Android smartphone — is one of the better ways to encourage that, it still leaves out billions of people who don’t have smartphones.

Even in America, where 81 percent of adults own smartphones, mass adoption will be tricky from both a cultural and practical perspective. Smartphones are still less accessible to lower-income people and seniors, populations that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and will increasingly be left behind. Those who do have phones will have to download the latest software updates (and have newer-model phones that can support the updates), download the app from the relevant public health authority, carry their phones with them everywhere they go, and want to participate in the first place. The bar to entry might simply be too high for too many people.

“We cannot solve a pandemic by coding the perfect app,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in its report about such digital contact-tracing tools. “Hard societal problems are not solved by magical technology, among other reasons because not everyone will have access to the necessary smartphones and infrastructure to make this work.”

Even if the Google-Apple tool achieves the necessary widespread adoption, it alone may not be enough to eliminate or reduce the spread of the virus. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said in a recent Project on Government Oversight panel discussion that contact tracing alone was a “somewhat superficial and not very meaningful” solution.

“When your house is on fire, there’s no way to do contact tracing,” Osterholm said. “[Coronavirus] is everywhere ... The only thing we know that really will work is a primary shutdown.”

This is especially true when you consider that many people who have the virus and are contagious are asymptomatic, meaning they never get tested at all. Only a mass-testing program, experts say, will allow people to safely stop social distancing. We need to significantly increase our testing capabilities for this; estimates range from 750,000 tests a week to 35 million a day. We aren’t anywhere near even the lower end yet, and there are many factors preventing us from achieving it anytime soon, from a shortage of basic materials like testing swabs to questions about the tests’ accuracy.

Landau, the Tufts professor, noted that even if Apple and Google use the tool only for the duration of the pandemic, we don’t know how they’ll define the end of the pandemic, and no one knows when that will be.

“It’s tempting to say after a certain time, the app will die,” she said. “We don’t know how long that will be. We don’t know if we’ll have a vaccine. We don’t know what percentage of the population will respond to that vaccine. There’s all sorts of unknowns.”

Even assuming Apple and Google have the most altruistic of intentions, their tool likely won’t be the pandemic-fighting silver bullet we all want. If we don’t know that it will solve this problem, it’s harder to justify the additional problems it will create. Altering their phones’ operating systems — even if that change is temporary — is a big deal. We can only hope the ends justify the means.

https://www.vox.com/,"A political divide over the response to the coronavirus pandemic was on stark display Wednesday in Lansing, Michigan, where about 3,000 conservative demonstrators rallied against the Democratic governor’s policies.

“Operation Gridlock” wasn’t intended to go beyond people driving around and honking their horns in opposition to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive stay-at-home order, organizers say, but some drivers got out of their cars and the event took on a flavor of a Trump rally, with some demonstrators, including members of militia groups, protesting close together while chanting slogans like “lock her up,” referencing the governor. Some attendees wore Make America Great Again hats and waved Confederate flags, and others carried AK-47s on the steps of the state capitol.

Whitmer’s handling of the coronavirus receives a favorable review from 71 percent of Michigan residents. Nationally, Whitmer has received some attention as a potential vice presidential pick for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The state has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. As of the morning of April 16, there were more than 28,000 confirmed cases in the state, resulting in over 1,900 deaths — the third most in the country. Last week, Whitmer responded by extending the state’s stay-at-home order through April 30, but she has also joined a coalition of Midwestern governors working together to determine an end to stay-at-home restrictions.

But a vocal subset of conservatives and libertarians have started to rebel, led in part by the Michigan Conservative Coalition. MCC spokesperson Matt Seely told Vox that the extension of the stay-at-home order made many Michiganders “nuts.”

Seely, who denounced the “jackasses” who brought weapons to the event, said the movement isn’t about partisanship. “We would have protested this executive order if it was an independent governor or a Republican governor. Party has nothing to do with this system, out of principle and our civil liberties.”

Still, surveys show that national attitudes about the government response to coronavirus are polarized around party ID and political attitudes. Morning Consult found that most Americans were practicing some form of social distancing in March, with Republican men being the least likely to say they were doing so. And the symbiotic relationship between President Trump and Fox News has contributed to this difference in attitudes. A recent study of Fox viewers found they reported being more skeptical of mainstream media reports about the virus and less likely to participate in social distancing.

Michigan is seeing the challenges of getting public buy-in for social distancing policies firsthand, and Trump’s messaging on Fox and in daily briefings mirror the divide. He’s consistently downplayed the pandemic and attempted to pin the blame on governors, particularly those of blue states (including Whitmer). And while those Vox spoke with in Michigan said that they understood how serious the coronavirus pandemic was, his message is clearly resonating with some conservatives and having a real-world effect on their attitudes and actions — potentially putting them and others at risk.

A confusing crackdown on home improvement supplies was a major factor

Conservatives in Michigan were already growing agitated with Whitmer’s aggressive response to the virus when she took another step that seemed nonsensical: Big-box hardware stores (larger than 50,000 square feet) were told they must close off aisles dedicated to paint supplies and lawn care until the end of April. They can still sell other goods deemed essential. “If you’re not buying food or medicine or other essential items, you should not be going to the store,” Whitmer said in a press conference earlier this month.

Some rally attendees complained to Fox News that Whitmer’s order seemed arbitrary. They can’t buy lawn fertilizer from Home Depot, visit siblings, or get their hair done, but lottery tickets are still for sale and liquor stores remain open. Seely told Vox, “Do you want people to leave their homes and risk infecting themselves and other people to get a lottery ticket? But I can’t go to the hardware store and buy grass seed for my lawn, buy a gallon of paint so that I can find myself doing a home project so I don’t go absolutely insane being locked at home. I mean, none of that makes any sense.”

Chants of “recall Whitmer,” “USA” and “lock her up” outside Michigan Capitol. #OperationGridlock pic.twitter.com/7Q7niiNFUF — Malachi Barrett (@PolarBarrett) April 15, 2020

MCC president Roseanne Ponkowski told Vox that on her way to Lansing, some rally attendees saw Michigan Department of Transportation workers planting trees and flowers along the highway and in the capitol. “And yet private businesses can’t do that. ... So it’s like there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason.” She added, “We have a lot of jobs that just by the nature of the work are social distancing. The man cutting your grass on the riding lawnmower is social distancing. Why can’t he be working?”

Republicans in the state, especially those in the more rural northwestern areas, share the frustration. The Guardian explains:

Four sheriffs in the north-western Lower Peninsula called Whitmer’s orders a “vague framework of emergency laws” that are frustrating citizens. The Leelanau county sheriff, Mike Borkovich, said people did not understand why they could not take a child fishing in a motorboat but they could use a kayak. “We’re trying to keep the peace with people ... The economy is coming apart in northern Michigan. People are upset,” Borkovich told the Associated Press. “People are frantic to get back to work. They have been very edgy.”

Part of the reason for the skepticism among conservatives is also about geography. The metro Detroit area, which is overwhelmingly Democratic, has been hit much harder by the pandemic than the rest of the far-redder state. For example, in Iron County, on the state’s upper peninsula, there have been zero confirmed cases of coronavirus thus far. In Wayne County, which includes Detroit, there have been more than 12,500 confirmed cases.

Public health officials have said that social distancing rules are important even if a region hasn’t seen very many cases. Because the virus’s incubation period can be up to 14 days, there is a lag between when the virus starts spreading and when cases begin to emerge.

And members of the MCC were notably dubious about coronavirus just a few weeks ago — largely following rhetoric stemming from the White House. Early in the pandemic, members of the MCC posted on Facebook that Democrats were “cheerleaders” for coronavirus and reshared a Breitbart article arguing that the coronavirus threat was being overstated. One MCC leader vowed to continue holding mass events as recently as a month ago.

Whitmer isn’t changing her policies

If the goal of Wednesday’s demonstration was to persuade Whitmer to reconsider the stay-at-home order, it doesn’t appear to have succeeded. Later Wednesday, the governor spoke to MSNBC and said “the sad irony here is that the protest was that they don’t like being in this stay-at-home order, and they may have just created a need to lengthen it, which is something we’re trying to avoid at all costs.

“We know that this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people’s health,” Whitmer added. “We know that when people gather that way without masks … that’s how Covid-19 spreads.”

What remains to be seen, however, is whether the demonstration will persuade the Republicans that control Michigan’s legislature to block Whitmer’s efforts to continue the states of emergency and disaster that will expire at the end of the month unless they are extended by lawmakers.

Trump is pinning the disaster on governors — including Whitmer

Whitmer, like other Democratic governors, has been critical of the federal government’s coronavirus response. She’s become a particularly pronounced target of abuse from Trump, who has referred to her as “the woman in Michigan” and “Failing Michigan Governor.”

Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2020

Trump’s victory in 2016 hinged on winning in Michigan, where he edged out Hillary Clinton by a slim margin. He picked up votes in areas of the state that haven’t yet experienced high rates of infection or deaths and where some are agitated by the social distancing rules. New polling by the American Enterprise Institute found that even among Republicans, those living in rural areas were more likely to say that Trump had responded to the pandemic well and less likely to say that they were concerned about the outbreak.

At his daily press briefings, Trump has routinely deflected responsibility for his administration’s failures in responding to the virus, instead attempting to pin the blame on governors, arguing that they should have built their own stockpiles of ventilators and protective medical gear like masks and gloves rather than rely on the federal government’s.

At the same time, he’s urging states with areas that are less hard hit to get ready to reopen. And his messaging is resonating with some Republicans across the country. In Minnesota and Kentucky, for instance, some residents are also agitating for their Democratic governors to lift stay at home orders.

The installation of social distancing policies that seemed confusing to some may have been the tipping point for protesters in Michigan. But weeks of denials from the White House of the pandemic’s true cost have done little to help.

https://www.vox.com/,"The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a new loan initiative aimed at helping small businesses weather the economic fallout from the coronavirus response, has already run out of money, according to a statement from the Small Business Administration.

Lawmakers had allocated $349 billion to PPP as part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill that Congress passed in March, but these funds were ultimately far from sufficient to meet demand. As of this week, banks and lenders had processed more than 1.3 million loans, with as many as 700,000 small businesses and nonprofits still waiting on funding.

PPP is an entirely new program that was established to provide forgivable loans to small businesses as they grapple with social distancing measures and other restrictions that have forced many to temporarily shutter or reduce their services. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, which the stimulus also included $10 billion for, has also been rapidly depleted.

The shortages in funds aren’t the only issues that have plagued the small-business loans recently greenlit by the stimulus. The programs have dealt with tech delays, access problems, and loopholes that enable larger companies to reap key benefits.

Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers agree that more money needs to be approved for the PPP, but they’re currently at an impasse over whether a new funding package should include money for the EIDL, as well as states and hospitals.

Republicans, thus far, have been pushing the swift approval of $250 billion in stand-alone funding to replenish the PPP. Meanwhile, Democrats would like to pass a more ambitious interim spending package and are using the leverage they have in Congress to make that happen.

There’s a stalemate in Congress about how to pass new funding

The fight over new funding for the small-business program is founded on a central disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over how expansive stimulus programs need to be.

Republicans would like to focus narrowly on the PPP program and have called for Congress to unanimously approve this money so lawmakers don’t have to return physically to vote and further delay this funding.

“Millions of small businesses are in limbo because Democrats refused to put aside partisan politics and fund this bipartisan program,” Sen. Marco Rubio, chair of the upper chamber’s Small Business Committee, said in a statement. “I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass a clean funding bill for PPP.”

Democrats, however, would like to see Republicans allocate additional money to boost hospitals and states, which are already suffering severe shortfalls due to coronavirus-related costs and reduced revenues. They’d like to see $100 billion allocated to health care providers, $150 billion for states and cities, and more support for SNAP.

Democrats are also interested in making sure that part of the new $250 billion in small-business funding goes to the EIDL program, which provides forgivable grants. And they’d like to see guarantees that direct some of the funding for PPP to community-based lenders, which are more accessible to minority-owned and rural businesses that are less likely to have existing relationships with the larger banks.

This recent PPP development is set to put more pressure on Democrats as Republicans — including President Donald Trump — criticize their efforts to block a funding bill. Democratic leaders have signaled, however, that they aren’t planning to cave on such measures unless they receive some concessions from the GOP.

Democrats are blocking additional funding for the popular Paycheck Protection Program. They are killing American small businesses. Stop playing politics Dems! Support Refilling PPP NOW – it is out of funds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020

All of this is further complicated by the fact that most lawmakers are working remotely right now and aren’t able to vote, meaning any legislation would need to pass with strong unanimous support. Since lawmakers can’t vote remotely, legislation would have to be approved either via unanimous consent or a voice vote by those who are physically able to be on the Hill. In both cases, however, one lawmaker who opposes the process could try to block the bill from going through, so Congress needs to be in full agreement in order for anything to pass.

Because of the ongoing disagreement between the two parties, additional small business funding might not move forward until lawmakers are able to physically return to the Capitol in May.

In the meantime, thousands of small businesses are simply forced to wait.

https://www.vox.com/,"One of the most striking elements of the coronavirus crisis is how easily the response has been folded into America’s partisan culture war. From the earliest days of the outbreak, Republicans in Congress, party-aligned media, and voters have tended to play down the pandemic and treat the push for social distancing skeptically — while also positing nefarious motives for liberals and public officials who take opposite positions. There are exceptions, like Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, but corona-skepticism and hyper-partisanship has been more much the rule.

The Trump administration was infamously slow to embrace distancing and conduct widespread testing; even now, President Donald Trump is privately pushing to rapidly reopen the country starting May 1. Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, who didn’t declare a state of emergency until April 2, recently declared WWE wresting an “essential service” that can continue to broadcast live shows. Conservative media has cast Democratic governors who have imposed distancing as authoritarians, pitting allegedly authentic Americans who want to reopen the country against out-of-touch liberal elites who don’t care about the lockdown’s economic consequences.

It is, of course, desperately important to establish a sense of shared reality and responsibility here. You need a cross-elite consensus on coronavirus, not only to swiftly pass essential legislation like more expansive forms of stimulus, but also to make sure the entire citizenry actually follows public health best practices in their daily lives. The more Republicans and allied media treat the coronavirus as a partisan issue, the harder those things will become.

How did the coronavirus become folded into the culture war in such a harmful way? One of the best explanations I’ve seen comes from David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College. The GOP, Hopkins writes on his personal blog, is failing on coronavirus not by accident — but because the party was built in a way that produced failure.

“The contemporary Republican Party has been built to wage ideological and partisan conflict more than to manage the government or solve specific social problems,” Hopkins writes. “So perhaps it shouldn’t be shocking that an array of subjects, from what medical treatment might help COVID patients to how important it is to take measures protecting the lives of the elderly, have been drawn into the perpetual political wars.”

This analysis draws on Hopkins’s book Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats, coauthored with Michigan State’s Matt Grossmann. In the book, Hopkins and Grossman argue that there’s a fundamental structural difference between the Democratic and Republican parties: While the former is a coalition of social groups, the latter is primarily a vehicle for a single cohesive ideological movement.

This difference makes it much easier for conservative Republicans to push the party to the fringes on the right than it does for leftist Democrats to do the same. But it also means that the GOP is less able to shift its policy approach to adapt to specific policy problems: It is so consumed by ideology, so preoccupied with the war on Democrats and liberals, that it cannot countenance cooperating with them to address a shared national problem. The Republican party needs a perpetual liberal enemy.

In other countries — Canada, for example — the coronavirus has created unprecedented levels of cross-party cooperation and consensus, as everyone recognizes that it’s in the common national interest to fight the virus through mass measures like social distancing.

In the United States, by contrast, even positions on basic medical issues, like whether hydroxychloroquine should be promoted as an effective therapy for the virus, are becoming partisan-signaling fights. Conservative media in the US is touting a more relaxed “Swedish response” to the crisis — despite Sweden’s lack of restrictions producing far higher death tolls than those of its neighbors — and arguing that liberals are exploiting the restrictions to impose their agenda on the country.

Sometimes, the impulse to polarize everything works well for Republicans in crass political terms. It helped Trump escape impeachment despite clear evidence of his guilt. But Hopkins thinks it might not work out so well this time around:

Republicans need a party-wide reset of priorities. There has seldom been a time in recent political history when daily partisan point-scoring has been rendered more irrelevant. The general election is far enough away that good policy is good politics: the best way for the ruling party to serve its own electoral interests is to work as hard as possible over the next seven months to render COVID manageable and prevent economic freefall. The widespread public confidence that will be necessary for “normal life” to resume simply can’t be jawboned back into existence via daily press conferences, radio broadcasts, or Fox News monologues. If Republicans lose the battle with the coronavirus, they won’t have much of a chance to win the fight against liberalism.

Owning the libs is the raison d’être of the current Republican party. It’s not a governing strategy in normal times. But in a crisis, it’s downright catastrophic — and quite possibly self-defeating.

https://www.vox.com/,"Another 5.2 million Americans filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the total in just four weeks up to 22 million. And the damage being done to the economy from extended lockdowns is beginning to spark protests in some states.

President Donald Trump has promised to present guidelines to governors in the coming days on how to reopen their states, though he acknowledged that not every state will be able to ease measures at the same time. Many states have made it clear that their lockdowns won’t be ending anytime soon.

On Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York’s coronavirus shutdown would continue until at least May 15. The day before, he mandated that New Yorkers must now wear face coverings anytime they’re in public and might not be able to consistently stay six feet away from people.

Meanwhile, several countries in Europe have loosened their lockdown restrictions. Germany is the latest to phase in a reopening for May, though German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the country’s success was delicate and not guaranteed. “We are walking on thin ice,” she said.

Here’s what you need to know today.

More than 22 million US jobless claims

The unfolding economic catastrophe is now approaching the scale of the Great Depression.

Last week’s number (5.2 million initial claims) was a slight improvement on the previous week’s 6.6 million figure, but it’s clear the United States is facing a crisis that it has not seen in a generation. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias pointed out, Congress’s stimulus package did expand categories of unemployment, meaning more people are eligible to file for unemployment under these expanded categories. But even so, the rapidity of this economic collapse is startling.

And the question of trying to “reopen” the economy is becoming much more fraught. Protests have broken out in Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio against those states’ coronavirus restrictions, with many in attendance violating social distancing rules to make their points.

President Donald Trump has said he plans to release a blueprint for reopening states as soon as Thursday. “We’ll be opening up some states much sooner than others,” he said Wednesday at his evening press conference. “We think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1.”

While some states have not been hit as hard by the coronavirus, and others, like Washington, look as if they’ve successfully flattened the curve, governors are being cautious about when to begin easing restrictions, and in some cases, planning to come up with regional strategies.

Any economic recovery will depend on whether coronavirus is under control in the US, which has now confirmed more than 641,000 coronavirus cases.

New Yorkers must wear face masks in public now

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued a new executive order that requires wearing face coverings in public. It will go into effect on Friday. The governor said that masks, bandanas, or scarves should be worn on public transit and anytime people are at risk of coming within less than six feet of each other. Cuomo said the rule could be enforced with civil penalties. (Cuomo, on Thursday, also extended New York’s coronavirus restrictions until at least May 15.)

“Stopping the spread is everything,” Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany on Wednesday. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already urged city residents to wear face coverings in public, and other states have taken similar steps. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy has required the use of face coverings in stores and on transit. Gov. Larry Hogan in Maryland has issued similar guidelines. Earlier this month, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gave a press conference encouraging the public to wear cloth masks, and modeled one himself.

All officials are clear on one thing, though: Medical-grade masks need to be saved for the health care and essential workers on the frontlines. If you need a mask and don’t know where to get one, Vox’s Alanna Okun has a great explainer on how to make your own.

Germany is the latest EU country to start easing restrictions

Germany is slowly loosening up its lockdown coronavirus lockdown restrictions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. The country is taking a gradual approach. Some of its shops will begin to open next week, though people must still keep their distance and Merkel is encouraging people to wear masks in public. The country also plans to reopen some schools May 4, though it will likely include mitigation strategies like smaller class sizes.

Large gatherings are still off-limits, and big events and religious services are banned until the end of August. Bars and restaurants remain closed, though the government will reevaluate that at the end of the month, reports the Financial Times.

Merkel was careful to avoid declaring victory, describing Germany’s situation as a “fragile intermediate success” because of its aggressive measures. Germany has managed the coronavirus better than some of its European neighbors, which is also credited to the country’s capacity to conduct about 50,000 tests per day. Germany has confirmed more than 135,000 cases, and recorded less than 4,000 deaths as of April 16.

Merkel also made very clear that while the situation was on the upswing, that could change abruptly, and that Germany had to remain vigilant. “But at the same time we’ve learnt that without restrictions, the speed of infection increases very quickly,” Merkel said. “For that reason, we must do everything we can to safeguard the successes of the last few weeks.”

This is how Angela Merkel explained the effect of a higher #covid19 infection rate on the country's health system.

https://www.vox.com/,"The Covid-19 coronavirus is threatening to roar back in some countries — like Singapore and South Korea — that had been hailed for swift and effective responses to their outbreaks and are beginning to relax their control measures. It’s a brutal reminder that no country has defeated this virus and that progress against the pandemic is fragile.

Other countries, including Denmark, Austria, and the Czech Republic, are aiming to lift their lockdowns in the coming weeks as well. Ending social distancing is a tempting prospect for the United States, too, as it continues to take a massive economic toll. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned on April 12 that suddenly relaxing these control measures would lead to “extraordinary risk of there being a rebound.”

That’s because even as domestic transmission of the disease declines, with fewer new cases and fewer hospitalizations, there is still a risk of new clusters popping up and of cases being spread from other regions or parts of the world. The solution to the pandemic, then, requires not just large, country-level interventions like mass testing and contact tracing, but also coordinating across borders and bolstering disease responses in more vulnerable countries.

Imported Covid-19 infections are undermining some of the progress in several countries

Tactics ranging from widespread testing to heavy lockdowns to invasive contact tracing have helped reduce the rate of infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities from Covid-19 in several countries already past the epidemic peak.

However, as countries begin to lift these measures, some are starting to see a new uptick in cases. China, for instance, has been fighting the pandemic longer than any other country and for a period managed to limit the increase of new cases.

But it is now starting to see a new rise in Covid-19 infections as regions relax restrictions on movement, allowing in more cases of the disease, many from Chinese citizens returning from abroad.

Even in regions like Wuhan, China, the first epicenter of the outbreak, it’s likely less than 1 percent of the population was ever infected with the virus. That means there is no widespread immunity and that most people can still be infected, so the risk of a new outbreak remains. (Scientists are also still uncertain about whether surviving Covid-19 confers immunity to future infection and, if so, how long that immunity will last.)

Meanwhile, Singapore has not reported any new cases brought from abroad for the past seven days, but it has seen a rise in new infections, largely among foreign workers living in dormitories. And in South Korea, more than 100 people who recovered from the virus tested positive again.

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in these Asian countries should be instructive for what could happen in the US, after the peak in cases and hospitalizations. Even though the US has the largest number of confirmed cases in the world, the virus has likely only infected a small slice of the population, which means most of the country remains vulnerable to infection.

“This might just offer a glimpse of our future, because it is very hard to believe that the initial surge [of infections] will generate population immunity sufficient to do very much to blunt it in the future,” said Hanage in an email.

The global spread of Covid-19 threatens everyone

As countries try to throttle outbreaks within their borders, the pandemic continues to rage outside and can seep back in.

Infections are now starting to rise in new countries in Africa just as some of the earlier hot spots in Asia and Europe are curbing their caseloads. South Africa, for instance, only reported 27 Covid-19 infections as of April 15, but its current trajectory puts it on track to double every seven days. And many of the countries now facing the pandemic have fewer resources to test, track, and treat the infected.

“My concern is that we’re going have a rise again especially as this pandemic moves through low-income countries or middle-income countries, in particular in the Southern Hemisphere,” said Davidson Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University. “There is going to be a substantial risk for reintroduction, so we’re going to have to keep our guard up.”

In a global economy with a huge amount of international travel, the risk of reemergence of the virus in any given country will remain high, particularly when air travel picks up again.

Ending the pandemic demands international coordination

It’s clear then that no country is out of danger until everyone is out of danger. And it illustrates why the US response to Covid-19 can’t just end at the water’s edge.

“Indeed, global health security means we need to continuously invest in not only our own pandemic preparedness/response, but also in those around us,” said Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at George Mason University, in an email. “It is important that we support countries struggling with containment and continuously invest in global health security efforts.”

Domestically, countries will still have to lean on social distancing, widespread testing, and good hygiene to limit the spread of the virus. They have to do more rigorous testing of travelers. They will also have to help other countries fight infections through groups like the World Health Organization.

These efforts are critical to controlling the spread of the disease, particularly in areas with fewer health resources to cope with infections.

The fight against the Covid-19 pandemic will be long and costly, and it’s still an open question as to what strategy will work to end the disease. But it’s hard to conceive of a path forward that doesn’t involve countries working together.

https://www.vox.com/,"Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump to take action against China for its role in hiding the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. And what he chooses to do could greatly impact not only the future of the pandemic, but also the world’s most important global relationship.

Republican lawmakers want Trump to consider harsh measures against Beijing such as sanctioning Chinese leaders, opening a formal investigation into the disease’s origins, removing Chinese pharmaceutical companies from America’s supply chain, and more.

So far, Trump’s only retribution for the outbreak of over 2 million cases worldwide has been against the World Health Organization (WHO), an international body that helps countries identify and curb pandemics. On Tuesday, Trump announced he was freezing US funding for the WHO while his administration reviews how the organization handled the early signs of a health crisis out of Wuhan, China, the disease’s origination point.

But if Trump actually wanted to reprimand Beijing, what would be the best way for him to do that? To get a better sense of the options available to him, I asked 12 policy experts, including US lawmakers, former top US officials, and academics, what actions they’d recommend the president take.

Their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity, are below.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), ranking member, Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and Cybersecurity Policy

First, we need to be clear that we are talking about the Chinese government and ruling party, not the people of China. That’s important not only to prevent further escalation of the destructive anti-Asian racism we see here at home, but also to recognize Chinese doctors and nurses who were on the front lines from the start, independent Chinese journalists persecuted for their coverage, and people across China using the internet to echo Dr. Li Wenliang’s call for greater transparency, only to be silenced by censors.

We don’t know the true extent of the Chinese government’s complicity in the spread of the virus, and we may never have a full picture due to their obfuscation and control of information. We do know that they lied to their own people and the world about the details and spread of the virus, and today we face a pandemic that has left no country untouched.

We need a deliberate US effort to counter Chinese influence and manipulation of international institutions. The administration cannot complain about an increasingly assertive China in international organizations, such as the WHO, when it fails to appoint diplomats to top posts and uses its own yearly contributions as blunt instruments rather than tools to shape policies in our interests. When the United States is absent on the world stage, China is only too happy to fill the void. This endangers our health security and national security.

Looking forward, we need to make sure that the United States has a medical supply chain that is not reliant on China or other foreign suppliers. We need to restore a stronger US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presence in China, as well as an embedded US presence in the Chinese CDC and unimpeded international access to identify the origins of the coronavirus.

The United States must also lead action in the UN Security Council to ensure that in the event of a declared health emergency, all countries grant on-the-ground access to WHO officials, as well as require that all countries transparently disseminate timely public health information to the WHO and to their own people. The WHO should no longer be at the mercy of a single member-state for information that affects the security of all countries.

And we need a commission akin to the 9/11 Commission, as I have called for, that recommends further actions to ensure that the mistakes that led to this health pandemic never happen again.

Jacob Stokes, senior policy analyst in the China program, US Institute of Peace

The US response should focus on establishing the facts surrounding the virus’s origins and China’s early missteps in a credible, impartial, and scientific manner. This approach makes sense for two reasons.

The first is that, based on reliable reporting about China’s initial fumbling, the facts appear to be damning on their own. The United States should make sure that evidence of Chinese mishandling and politicization of the problem is exhaustively documented and well-understood around the world. Washington should recognize, however, that letting the facts speak for themselves will be more convincing to third parties than trying to embellish or sensationalize. The United States should show, not tell.

Second, in the contest of governance systems between liberal democracy and authoritarian capitalism, openness and transparency are advantages — the lack of which seemingly allowed the virus to take hold in the first instance. Ensuring the facts are brought to light in a credible way, in conjunction with allies and multilateral organizations, will pressure China to take responsibility. And it could result in other positive outcomes as well, such as further boosting Taiwan’s image abroad.

Next, if one of the two leading theories about the virus’s origin — that it started in a Wuhan wet market, or that it accidentally escaped a Chinese lab that was studying animal coronaviruses — turns out to be correct, then pressuring Beijing to fix disastrous regulatory and enforcement failures should obviously be a top priority. The same goes for upholding China’s commitments to international public health agreements.

The overriding goal of any response, though, should be preventing another pandemic. Policymakers should avoid creating incentives for any country, including China, to avoid reporting a potential outbreak in the future for fear of being blamed or punished. Imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or allowing victims to sue China for Covid-19-related damages could dissuade countries from sounding the alarm early next time.

I generally favor taking a tougher line toward China on a range of policy issues, from its assertive military behavior to its human rights crackdown and abusive trade practices. But there should be some issues both superpowers try to separate from geopolitical competition, even if they won’t be 100 percent successful, because those issues are fundamentally negative-sum games.

Nobody “wins” a pandemic. We should keep that in mind right now.

Michelle Murray, director of global initiatives, Bard College

First, the United States should not use China as a scapegoat for the pandemic and its failed response at home. When the Trump administration refers to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” it not only conjures up racist stereotypes that are unethical in their own right, but also serves to shift the blame for the pandemic squarely onto China.

Without a doubt, China’s failure to be transparent about the emergence of the virus in November and its failure to involve international health experts to manage the containment led the disease to spread throughout the world. It is also true, however, that the United States is the current epicenter of the pandemic in no small part because of the bungled response of the Trump administration and its failure to organize even minimal preparations.

Put simply, the blame-shifting from the Trump administration elides the fact that both China and the United States bear responsibility in creating the conditions that exist today. An important effect of this rhetoric is that it positions China as a lesser, distinctly incapable global power relative to the superior United States, which in turn, precludes the kind of international cooperation that a pandemic requires.

Second, the United States must actively seek China’s help in understanding and containing the novel coronavirus. These efforts should include the creation of an international working group to coordinate efforts to address the pandemic, whose mandate encourages the sharing of scientific expertise among states in order to guide policy.

“Nobody ‘wins’ a pandemic.” — Jacob Stokes, US Institute of Peace

As the first country to experience the pandemic, Chinese scientists have unique knowledge to contribute to such an effort and could take a leading role in shaping the global response to the disease. By designing a response that engages China on the science of the virus, the US may recognize the important role China can play in this area, while also sidestepping the many thorny political dynamics that have characterized US-China relations over the past several years.

Whatever form it takes, recognition and cooperation must be at the center of any American response to China’s role in the spread of the coronavirus. If done with care, these cooperative endeavors could provide the foundation for cooperation in other areas of US-China relations in the years to come.

Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health, Council on Foreign Relations

There is really not much the US can do. We could blame China for causing the outbreak, but the US was the origin of the 1918 Spanish flu [Editor’s note: this is still disputed] and arguably the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

We could say that China should be held accountable for the pandemic, especially given its initial mishandling of the outbreak. But our own handling of the outbreak was characterized by inaction and ineffectiveness, not to mention that in international politics, we cannot really hold a sovereign state “accountable” for a disease outbreak.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), chair, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation

China has not been a responsible international partner in the global fight against Covid-19.

China’s lack of transparency and cooperation with the global health community, including the United States, slowed down our understanding of the virus and how to contain it — putting the world at far greater risk. In the critical early stages of the virus, China refused to allow international experts to come to the epicenter of the virus and suppressed information about the severity of the virus. China is culpable for their inactions and mismanagement.

But in order for us to ultimately defeat Covid-19, it will require a coordinated global response. As one of the world’s most powerful countries, China is a critical actor in the fight against coronavirus and any future pandemic outbreak.

Moving forward, it’s incumbent that China understands the important role it plays in the global health community and acts as a responsible and transparent partner. As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, I will continue to press the global community, including China, to do everything it can to prevent another pandemic outbreak like Covid-19.

Ryan Hass, China director on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017; fellow, Brookings Institution

No one who has been closely watching the unfolding of this pandemic could conclude that it had emerged from anywhere other than China, or that China’s negligent initial response to the outbreak contributed to its spread. The world knew all of this, even before Washington and Beijing prodded each other into a counterproductive narrative war.

It’s deeply unfortunate that the world’s two most capable powers are consumed by finger-pointing and blame-shifting while the pandemic spreads, literally killing thousands and destroying economies in its wake.

The United States will not be able to protect its people until it stamps out the virus in every corner of the world. Such an outcome will not be possible unless a consortium of powers pools its capabilities to do so. It’s hard to imagine that occurring until the United States and China find a way toward even a minimal level of coordination (e.g., on vaccine trials, production, and delivery).

To keep the focus where it needs to be in the midst of this crisis — saving lives and stopping the spread of the virus — it would be helpful if both Washington and Beijing could commit now, that after the crisis has passed, they both will fully and transparently support a UN-led after-action report of Covid-19, whereby leading scientists could determine the origin of the virus, causes of its rapid spread, and lessons that must be learned to prevent a recurrence.

Jiaqi Liang, assistant professor, University of Illinois at Chicago

In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, both the US and China had moments of mismanagement. Amid the escalated feud between the two countries, we have seen the importance of their interconnection and the negative impacts of worsened US-China relations.

China has played a critical role in the global supply chain, including pharmaceutical active ingredients and personal protective equipment (PPE), which are in high demand in many countries. Also, to fight the pandemic, we need close cooperation and communication among the global scientific and public health care communities, in which China is an important actor with much-needed experiences and lessons.

Meanwhile, the widespread economic fallout in the US and Europe has taken a toll on China’s economy, even if the latter has tried to jump-start its economic activities after a months-long lockdown.

Looking ahead, the US and China should rebuild their relations through mutual understanding, continued dialogue, and long-term collaboration.

Daniel Russel, US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2013 to 2017; vice president, international security and diplomacy, Asia Society Policy Institute

Accountability is needed for China’s failure to close its “wet markets,” as it pledged to do after the SARS outbreak; its failure to inform the world promptly of the dangerous new pathogen emerging in Wuhan; and the initial cover-up that allowed the new virus to spread far beyond Wuhan and spill across international borders.

But the ability of the US to lead an appropriate response depends on Washington restoring lost credibility. So first and foremost, the US government needs to launch an effective effort to stem the outbreak in America, aid afflicted countries, lead global coordination through the G20 and the WHO, and rapidly produce a vaccine against the coronavirus.

Only then will the US have the credibility needed to hold China to account.

Maria Adele Carrai, associate research scholar, Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University

It would be an error for the US to blame China as “responsible” for the Covid-19 outbreak.

According to the International Health Regulations (2005), state parties have reporting requirements. They have to inform the WHO of all cases of human influenza caused by a new subtype in their territories within 24 hours. While China did not report immediately, and contributed to a delay in the global response, it cannot be considered the culprit in a pandemic.

The reason is that there is no proper definition of international responsibility for pandemics. In practice, no single actor has been held accountable for pandemics so far. And while the US can continue to promote reforms in China and reestablish dialogue and trust, the best response is to increase cooperation with the international community and lead the development of international health law.

Following the example of President George W. Bush’s International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, the US could also lead new forms of international cooperation to increase international coordination, transparency, and international capacity to identify and contain new pandemics.

This is not the time for the US to withdraw from international organizations. It is time to actively participate in them and reform them, filling the gaps in pandemic accountability and responsibility.

Aaron Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs, Princeton University; author, A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia

The time to press for a full accounting of Beijing’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic will be once the current crisis has begun to recede.

For the moment, without getting our hopes up, we should remain open to the possibility of cooperating with China in fighting the virus and coping with its consequences. At the same time, however, we should vigorously counter Beijing’s efforts to rewrite history and cast itself as a savior and a model rather than as the source of this catastrophe.

In the somewhat longer term, the United States and other like-minded countries should create an independent, international “truth commission” to explore the origins and unfolding of the pandemic.

Aside from whatever happens with China, the US and other democracies should work together to enhance coordination and improve cooperation on a wide range of issues, including reducing their dependence on China for the drugs, medical devices, and other equipment that will be needed to fight the next global outbreak of infectious disease.

Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan

The US should highlight China’s missteps through open sources of information, especially our media institutions and academic research. In particular, investigative journalists and academic researchers should analyze China’s official data on infections and deaths as there is likely significant underreporting.

We should highlight the institutional and regulatory failures that led to the delay in reporting and to the punishment of whistleblowers, activists, and journalists, which continues to this day. Media outlets outside of China should continue to highlight the censorship, repression, and information control that squash independent Chinese voices.

More generally, there should be a strong pushback against the official Chinese Communist Party narrative that President Xi Jinping and the party [have asserted], instead of against China’s citizens, civil society, and health care workers.

The US should reverse its decision to halt funding to the WHO. It should admit to its own mistakes from late January until early March in downplaying the severity of the virus. And it should spearhead an international effort to control the pandemic and develop a successful vaccine.

Marine Lt. Gen. Chip Gregson (Ret.), US assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2009 to 2011; senior adviser, Avascent Global Advisors

The best thing we could do in the wake of China’s past actions is to lead the international response, building networks of cooperation and sharing research, development, and logistical support to health workers.

Unfortunately, we’re forfeiting that chance by missing no opportunity to pick fights with our allies and friends. The polling on expectations overseas and even in our hemisphere that we will “do the right thing” are terrible. We compete over supplies, and in Asia we are picking counterproductive fights with South Korea and Japan over cost-sharing.

We grew to unprecedented power after World War II by helping our allies and friends, in what used to be called the “free world,” become successful. Democracy grew around the world, most notably in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, and other places. Now democracy declines across the globe, in large part because we’ve forgotten who we are.

If China emerges from the pandemic as an international leader, we have only ourselves to blame.

https://www.vox.com/,"At a press conference Wednesday evening, President Trump went on a long rant accusing the Senate of being too slow to confirm his nominees to executive and judicial roles, although the Senate has confirmed Trump’s judges at a much faster pace than the nominees of other recent presidents. He then threatened to use a presidential power that has never been used before in American history.

Referring to a process the Senate uses to neutralize the president’s ability to make temporary appointments while the Senate is in recess, Trump claimed that “the current practice of leaving town while conducting phony ‘pro forma’ sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis,” labeling this process “a scam.”

The Constitution permits the president to “fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate,” although these appointments typically expire after a little more than a year.

Pro forma sessions are extraordinarily brief sessions that the Senate holds every few days while it is not conducting business. The Supreme Court held in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning (2014) that the Senate may use these brief sessions to nominally prevent itself from recessing — thus preventing the president from making recess appointments.

If the Senate does not abandon these pro forma sessions, Trump threatened to use a “very strong power” to adjourn Congress — thus forcing the Senate into recess and opening up Trump’s ability to make recess appointments.

In theory, this trick could work. In practice, however, it appears unlikely to succeed. And even if it does succeed, Trump will gain very little.

Trump’s power to adjourn Congress is weak

Despite Trump’s claim that he has a “very strong power” to adjourn Congress, this power is actually quite limited. The Constitution provides that the president may adjourn both houses of Congress “to such Time as he shall think proper,” but only “in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.”

Thus, the president’s power to adjourn Congress is only triggered when the two houses disagree about when to adjourn.

As University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck notes on Twitter, right now the House and Senate are in agreement about when to adjourn — they plan to formally adjourn on January 3, 2021, the day when current House terms expire. So long as the houses are in agreement, the president has no power to adjourn them.

At the moment, Congress does not plan to return to work until May 4. In theory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could try to call the Senate back to Washington sooner — so that it could formally vote to either adjourn or to disagree with the House about the proper date of adjournment — but McConnell does not appear particularly inclined to do that.

In a statement responding to Trump’s threat to adjourn the Senate, a McConnell spokesperson said that “the leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the Covid-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules, that will take consent from [Democratic] Leader [Chuck] Schumer.”

All of that said, if McConnell were determined to engineer a situation where Trump could make recess appointments, he could most likely do so. As Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me, “motions to adjourn are not debatable” in the Senate, which means that Senate Democrats could not use the filibuster to block such a motion. If McConnell wanted to adjourn the Senate, “a simple majority vote would suffice.”

It’s not immediately clear which jobs Trump would fill by recess appointment if such an adjournment happened, although CNN suggests that the list may include “the director of national intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department and an undersecretary of agriculture.”

For the most part, Trump’s nominees have received a favorable reception in the Republican-controlled Senate, although there are some exceptions. For example, Trump’s Federal Reserve nominee Judy Shelton, a one-time advocate for fringe positions such as a return to the gold standard, has raised concerns among some Senate Republicans.

Trump would gain little from adjourning the Senate

Outlier nominees like Shelton aside, Trump would see little benefit if the Senate were formally adjourned.

Let’s suppose, for the sake of argument, that Trump succeeds in adjourning the Senate. Then what? The most likely answer is that Trump would have to keep Congress out of session for a decent amount of time, and in the middle of a global crisis, before he could invoke his recess appointments power.

Under Noel Canning, the president’s recess appointments power is triggered during a “recess of substantial length.” Though the Court did not fully define the word “substantial,” it did strongly imply that the recess typically must be at least 10 days. “Though Congress has taken short breaks for almost 200 years, and there have been many thousands of recess appointments in that time,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court, “we have not found a single example of a recess appointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than 10 days.”

In order to make recess appointments, in other words, Trump would likely need to send Congress away for at least 10 days in the middle of a pandemic. And he would need to do so at a time when the economy is hemorrhaging jobs — a total of 22 million people filed new unemployment claims since social distancing measures began in March.

In fairness, Congress already does not plan to return to Washington until early May, but that is largely so that Congress can practice the same social distancing that much of the nation is currently engaged in. Before Trump could adjourn Congress, the Senate would have to break this social distancing and pass a resolution that would enable it to be formally adjourned. It’s unlikely, especially given McConnell’s lack of enthusiasm for such an maneuver, that members of the Senate would risk their own health so that Trump could make recess appointments.

And all of this would be so that Trump could fill a few jobs with Republican appointees, most of which the Republican-controlled Senate was likely to confirm anyway, if Trump were just a bit more patient.

Democratic political operatives couldn’t dream of a more damaging story to tell about Trump during a presidential election year. The president is threatening to delay stimulus legislation, relief for many people who are unemployed, and potentially funding for necessary public health measures, over a petty dispute about a few political job vacancies.

And, while judges nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate may serve for life, judges given a recess appointment receive a temporary appointment that expires at the end of the Senate’s next session. The current session ends in early January, and the next session will likely end in January of 2022. So a recess-appointed judge would serve less than two years.

The Senate could potentially confirm these recess appointees in the interim, giving them a lifetime appointment. But absent such a confirmation vote, any judicial vacancies Trump fills with a recess appointment could potentially be filled again very soon by a Biden appointee.

Similarly, while Trump could conceivably appoint someone like Shelton to the Federal Reserve, without Senate confirmation she would only serve a very brief term — not the 14-year term typically served by board members.

So Trump is literally threatening to do something that’s never been done — adjourn Congress by presidential decree. And he stands to gain very little from doing so.

https://www.vox.com/,"In September, Phoenix celebrated a milestone: All of its public libraries were open on a Sunday for the first time in a decade. Library hours had been cut during the Great Recession, during which the city was slammed, and restoring them was a small but important marker in its continued recovery.

Now, Phoenix is staring down a crisis yet again.

“The last recession felt like running down a hill,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. “This one feels like falling off a cliff, it happened so quickly.”

Before the coronavirus outbreak, Phoenix was projecting a $28 million surplus for the upcoming fiscal year. Now, it’s anticipating a $26 million deficit. Arizona expected a $1 billion surplus and is now staring down a $1.1 billion deficit.

The global pandemic and accompanying economic crisis have knocked states and cities across the country back on their heels. States are hemorrhaging money to stand up medical systems and field unemployment claims while watching their revenue plummet. People have been ordered to stay at home, meaning sales tax revenues are way down, and as layoffs take hold, revenue from income tax is falling as well. Tax Day for 2019 filings has been delayed until July, another blow to state budgets. Lost tourism seasons represent money lots of places won’t get back.

Governors and state lawmakers, many of whom are faced with constitutional balanced budget requirements, are going to have to make big cuts fast, unless the federal government does more to step in.

“Whether it’s tax increases or spending cuts, states tend to take money out of the economy during periods of stress, and that is not only financially difficult for their residents, but it also tends to delay the economic recovery,” said Josh Goodman, state economic development officer at Pew Charitable Trusts.

He estimates states missed out on $283 billion in the decade following the 2008 crisis, and state funding to education and local governments is still down across much of the country. State budget shortfalls this time around could total more than $500 billion in a single year, and cities and states across the country are sounding the alarm.

“We cut services because of that recession that we never restored,” Gallego said. “We are starting this decline already lean.”

The ways states and cities make money are drying up

About 70 percent of tax revenue for states comes from sales and income taxes, explained Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). And given that economic activity has been brought to a stop across much of the country — thousands of businesses have closed, millions of people have been laid off — you can start to see the problem.

“There’s no question that sales tax revenue has completely fallen off the table, so that’s about one-third of state revenues that are completely collapsing, and then income taxes are also falling rapidly with all those people getting laid off. And with the stock market decline, that means that quarterly tax payments that wealthy people and corporations pay will be lower,” Leachman said. “That’s two major revenue sources that are in very sharp decline, much steeper than anything from the Great Recession.”

The situation varies by state. A handful of states don’t have sales taxes or income taxes, and how much they rely on different taxes varies. For example, in 2014, 45 percent of Washington’s state and local tax collections came from sales taxes; just 13 percent did for Virginia. California, New York, Maryland, and Washington, DC, are more reliant on capital gains taxes, which are going to take a hit because of the downturn in the stock market.

“The last recession felt like running down a hill. This one feels like falling off a cliff, it happened so quickly.”

Other sources of revenue that will also be impacted — gas taxes, alcohol taxes, lottery revenue — vary by state as well. The drop in oil prices is doing harm in places such as Texas and North Dakota. Tourism-heavy places like Las Vegas and Florida are losing out on money they won’t get back. And then there’s the simple fact that some states and cities are being hit by the coronavirus crisis and accompanying recession more than others.

“There is no one whose budget is looking like it is fantastic, but how bad the downturn is going to be is going to depend on what taxes you rely on and what’s going on in your labor force, your economy, and your population,” said Kim Rueben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban Institute. She warned that if the coronavirus crisis begins to become a bigger issue in more rural counties, “that can be fiscally devastating because some of those places are much closer to the margins.”

And while the money states take in is plunging, some costs are skyrocketing, specifically unemployment insurance and medical costs. Millions of people have filed new unemployment claims over the past month, overwhelming state systems. Unemployment insurance is funded through payroll taxes paid by employers, and when there are this many claims, it’s highly likely that states will run out of money to pay out benefits. During the last recession, dozens of states had to borrow money from the federal government to cover unemployment costs.

“States don’t have armies, but they pay for health care, they pay for unemployment insurance and a few other things, and in recessions, Medicaid bills go way up, people lose their employer-sponsored health insurance, they go on Medicaid. And at a time like now, they might need medical care even more than usual,” said Danny Yagan, an economist at the University of California Berkeley. “Unemployment insurance claims go up, further draining from state coffers, and states don’t issue their own currency or may even have balanced budget amendments, so they can’t borrow the way the federal government does.”

States and cities are starting to sound the alarm

Most states follow a fiscal year that goes from July 1 to June 30 for their budgets (Alabama, Michigan, New York, and Texas are different). For many places, the numbers were looking pretty rosy just a few months ago. Now they’re not.

Take Wisconsin. Prior to the widespread Covid-19 outbreak in the United States, the state expected to see a more than $800 million surplus at the end of the fiscal year. Now, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum is warning that while the state is better positioned than it was before the Great Recession, it is going to be in trouble if the federal government doesn’t step in. And while the state’s towns, cities, and villages rely on property taxes as their primary source of taxation — which seems to be relatively stable for now — 68 of the state’s 72 counties also collect sales taxes, which have plunged.

“How bad the downturn is going to be is going to depend on what taxes you rely on and what’s going on in your labor force, your economy, and your population”

“The impact on the economy is devastating, and what we’ve seen develop over the course of the last four or five weeks has really been a tidal wave coming across the state,” said Missy Hughes, who heads the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

The data is still trickling in on what exactly lawmakers are dealing with, but it’s not looking good. “The numbers are hard to even wrap your head around,” Hughes said.

In Maryland, the state said it could see a $2.8 billion shortfall in the last three months of the fiscal year alone. New York state is expecting tax revenue losses of $10 billion to $15 billion.

Some states aren’t imposing cuts yet, in part because legislatures are not in session, some due to social distancing measures. But they’re going to start soon. Whatever estimates they made at the start of the year will basically have to be blown up and rewritten under much more dire fiscal circumstances.

States and cities aren’t like the federal government, which can run a large deficit. Many have balanced budget amendments, meaning they’re supposed to take in as much as they put out.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has said the state would look to cut 20 percent of its spending in light of the coronavirus outbreak. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak has requested that state agencies start preparing for 4 percent budget cuts for the fiscal year that ends in June and cuts of 6 to 14 percent for the next fiscal year.

States have “rainy day” funds that they can dip into if they need — the 50-state total recently reached $75 billion. But those rainy day funds can only go so far — the CBPP estimates state budget shortfalls due to coronavirus and the economic crisis could total more than $500 billion.

Colorado is now looking at a potential $3 billion shortfall, which would translate to a 10 percent budget cut for the year starting in July. “By statute, we have to have a balanced budget,” said Betsy Markey, who heads Colorado’s Office of Economic Development and International Trade. “Like every state, we’re looking at making some very difficult budget decisions in the coming fiscal year.”

Some states are better-positioned to weather the storm — and some are worse off. According to data from Moody’s Analytics, about one-third of states were unprepared for even a moderate recession heading into the crisis. Among them: Illinois, New Jersey, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The same thing goes for cities.

“In the Great Recession, some places, like Phoenix, got crushed, while other places, like San Antonio, really did not. We’re probably going to have something like that if the disease spread and layoffs are as locally concentrated as we’re seeing so far,” Yagan, the Berkeley economist, said.

State and city cuts translate to businesses and people

While talking about state and city budgets can seem pretty vague, ultimately, they come down to businesses and, really, people.

Most states have imposed stay-at-home orders and have mandated thousands of businesses shut. No more restaurants or bars, no department stores or boutiques, no hair salons, no barber shops, etc. There’s no tourism. People are spending a lot of money at the grocery stores, but they’re not the end-all, be-all of business, and a lot of grocery purchases aren’t taxed.

Hughes, the Wisconsin economic development director, said the state’s resources and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which allotted $349 billion to small-business loans, is a help, but there have been concerns about being able to access those funds. “As we watch this drama unfold, it’s almost a second hit that the small businesses are taking that’s a challenge to access those funds, and they’re not coming as readily as we need them to,” she said.

And it’s not just about keeping employees compensated and the bills paid. If and when businesses are given the go-ahead to reopen, they’re going to need some help, too. A coffee shop that’s been closed needs to get new inventory, get their workers back in the building, and let customers know they’re back in business. “If you think about the Main Street businesses, they’re small, they don’t need a lot, but they need an injection of energy,” Hughes said, estimating $2,500 or $5,000 would go a long way toward many businesses opening their doors again.

Of course, that’s assuming they stay afloat at all, and that the virus is under control sooner rather than later. “Businesses are saying that if this goes on for another period of time, I can withstand another 30 days, I can withstand another 60 days, but after that, I’m not going to be able to survive,” she said.

Beyond businesses, this obviously gets down to people. Workers across the country are being laid off in droves, draining state unemployment coffers. And when states and cities start looking at their budgets for places to cut, that translates to the people they employ. According to one recent survey, more than 1,000 cities are planning to scale back public services, and 600 think they’ll have to lay off workers.

“A huge percentage of what state and local governments buy [is] people’s time, and so to the extent that they have to balance their budgets and they’re making cuts, that’s going to mean layoffs and furloughs that would extend the economic part of this and the recession,” Rueben, from the Urban Institute, said.

The decisions made about budget cuts now will have lasting effects. Goodman, from Pew, said that state funding for higher education, K-12 education, and local aid are still down in many places because of the 2008 crisis. And state investment in infrastructure in the decade after the last recession was at its lowest level in 50 years.

And the worse off states and cities are, the slower the recovery if and when we get out of the health crisis end of things. Laid-off workers, shuttered businesses, and reduced services drag down the economy. “Once consumers and businesses have jumped out of the economic water, they dip their toes back in only very slowly, and the initial shock is often locally concentrated,” Yagan said.

The federal government is helping — but it needs to do a lot more

There are mechanisms in place for states and cities to get financial help as they try to ride this out, but there’s broad agreement that they’re probably going to need more.

The $2.2 trillion CARES Act provides $150 billion to state, tribal, and local governments. The package also includes $30 billion for education, $25 billion for mass transit systems, $5 billion for community development block grants, $3.5 billion for child care, and $400 million for elections. And it has the Paycheck Protection Program, the $349 billion loan program to small businesses meant to support them and keep their workers employed. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, temporarily increases federal funding for Medicaid.

But there are issues. The $150 billion in state funds has to be used for costs related to the virus — it can’t go toward closing budget gaps. The increased Medicaid funding will end when the health emergency does. And some small businesses are struggling to find a lender under the Paycheck Protection Program, which is already running low on money.

“That will most likely run out within the next week, and we are very supportive of Congress putting additional funds” into the PPP, said Markey, noting that Colorado has already realized nearly $6 billion in small-business loans.

The Federal Reserve has also said it will buy some municipal bonds, putting up to $500 billion into short-term loans for states, cities, and counties. But a Brookings Institution study finds that because of the program’s eligibility criteria, only 10 cities and 15 counties will be able to access it directly. And most cities with large black populations, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Detroit, will be left out and only able to go through their states. (The researchers say the problem appears unintentional.) There are also concerns that the two-year maturity limit on the notes the Fed will buy is too short a time frame for how long the economic recession might be. Private investors seem to have moved away from municipal bonds.

On Capitol Hill, there’s talk of a second CARES Act that could provide more aid to cities and states, and the Fed could do more as well. Leachman said grants to cities and states, specifically, would be helpful, and there’s a clear need for more funds for small businesses. But the greater risk appears to be that states and cities will get too little support, not too much.

“We’re already starting to see some states … start to cut back spending and lay off people. This is exactly one of the big reasons the Great Recession in 2009 had a lot of problems, because I don’t think they anticipated how tough the states would get, and as such, it counteracted or made worse the downward plunge,” said Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “We are totally in a position to stop that; the question is, again, if we will have the ability to do so.”

States and cities are already bracing for a tough road ahead. In Phoenix, its first phase of proposed budget cuts, totaling $27 million, includes a hiring freeze to save $13 million, axing a $4 million transfer to its rainy day fund, and deferring a $1 million planned payment to its public safety pension stabilization fund.

“I assume that will be one of many cuts we will make, but I believe the earlier we start, the less deep we’ll have to go,” Mayor Gallego said.

https://www.vox.com/,"Over the last week, from April 8-15, the US averaged about 151,000 coronavirus tests per day. At the end of last month, from March 25 to April 1, the country was performing about 110,000 tests every day.

The number of tests done each week has gone up, which is good. But experts say that’s far short of the millions upon millions more tests America needs to conduct every day if we’re to resume anything resembling normal life. Testing right now is not nearly good enough.

If the Trump administration is serious about starting to reopen the country soon and wants to avoid a lot more people getting sick, they need to fix the testing problem — fast. Because right now, we’re staring down the potentially toxic mixture of relaxed social distancing and insufficient testing.

To end social distancing, as Vox’s Umair Irfan put it quite plainly: “Test millions. Test early. Test late. Test over and over. Test until the whole damn pandemic is over.”

The path forward is clear, according to Umair’s reporting:

Following through on this would require a massive increase in government funding, huge numbers of workers trained to administer the tests, and the coordination of raw materials, manufacturing, and delivery across the entire global economy. It’s a costly, brute-force approach. But it may be the only way out of the expensive and blunt measures already deployed to control the pandemic, from social distancing to shelter-in-place orders. Right now, however, the US is struggling to test even 100,000 people per day, so getting to the scale some researchers suggest would demand a huge ramp up in capacity. Yet, they say, it’s possible to do it. And despite the immense financial and social costs of a national testing system, it may yet be the cheapest path to reopening the economy.

But right now, our testing capability is being restrained, remarkably, by two equal but opposing forces: supply shortages, which limits the number of tests that can be processed, and overly restrictive testing criteria, which curbs the number of tests ordered even when labs have actually more testing capacity.

”The system is decentralized and not coordinated,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “And the federal government has not stepped in to provide that coordination and help ramp up the manufacturing. Finally, we have such a testing deficit that we are playing a terrible game of catch-up.”

In both cases, the Trump administration and Congress could do more to fix it. More federal funding would help labs keep their capacity up, and less-stringent federal guidelines would allow doctors and hospitals to order more tests so everyone can better understand the scope of the pandemic.

As Brian Resnick and I reported a month ago, the testing fiasco started with faulty test kits getting sent out to labs. That problem has been fixed, thankfully; there are still some concerns about test accuracy, but that has been a problem for every country and would theoretically be mitigated if we were testing a whole lot more.

But now, testing is sluggish. Labs are either overwhelmed because they’re short on staff and supplies, or they’re sitting open because federal guidance is restricting how many people get tested.

Vox’s German Lopez covered the first problem late last week:

There is no widely accepted number for how many tests America should run each day, but the current number is generally considered far too low by experts. Jha put the ideal at 500,000 tests a day. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner and coauthor of the AEI report, suggested that everyone who goes to a doctor could be tested, which would amount to more than 500,000 a day. A Harvard model proposed millions of tests a day. Complaints vary, but labs say they don’t have enough swabs, test kits, reagents, personal protective equipment (PPE), staff, or machines to run the specific tests required. “Any one link in the chain of supply, any restriction in the chain of supply, can suddenly create a bottleneck,” Louise Serio, a spokesperson for the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA), which represents the private labs, told me. “No labs have, really, the predictable, consistent access to all the supplies we need, from reagents to test kits to PPE.”

Labs need more money, both for these supplies and to keep their staff employed, as their finances have taken a hit with most other kinds of medical testing sharply falling during the pandemic.

At the same time, Politico reported on Tuesday that some commercial labs were “now sitting with unused testing capacity waiting for samples to arrive.” The trade association for commercial labs, the American Clinical Laboratory Association, was practically begging for the testing criteria to be loosened.

“ACLA members have now eliminated testing backlogs, and have considerable capacity that is not being used,” ACLA President Julie Khani told Politico’s David Lim. “We stand ready to perform more testing and are in close communication with public health partners about ways we can support additional needs.”

The FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, was quoted saying the administration was examining the issue.

Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Recode’s Rani Molla and I update our estimates of how many people the US and other countries are testing. If you look back over the last month, the US has come a long way — but not far enough.

This was our chart from March 18, when the United States was embarrassingly behind:

And this is our chart from April 16. America has risen all the way up to ... mediocre compared to Italy (another one of the epicenters) and Germany (a model for good testing practices).

We have to get this right — and fast. As Vox’s Ezra Klein wrote last week, every single plan to relax social distancing and start to get life back to normal again depends on a dramatic increase in testing. Nobel laureate Paul Romer thinks we should be conducting 22 million tests every day. By that standard, the US testing capacity has barely budged since the last week of March. Even much less ambitious testing proposals remain far out of reach for the time being.

Setting aside the issue of scale, there is also little coordination in how the tests are being administered. Laurie Garret, a Pulitzer-winning author who has covered prior outbreaks, said we need a strategy for testing both the vulnerable populations (like nursing-home residents) and people who we want to return to their regular routines (like students).

”We need wisdom,” Garrett said. “Right now it’s nothing more than chaotic supply-and-demand.”

More than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths into this crisis and America still hasn’t risen to the challenge.

https://www.vox.com/,"In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon appears to be considering a new business: helping Amazon sellers with their own health insurance needs. Amazon sellers account for nearly 60 percent of Amazon’s retail sales, with around 900,000 active Amazon seller accounts in the US alone. That merchant base gives Amazon a huge potential target for such an offering.

Earlier this week, Amazon sent out a survey to its sellers, inquiring about the types of health insurance coverage these merchants offer their own employees. The survey, which Recode viewed, asked whether the sellers are satisfied with the coverage or would consider alternative options.

“What can be improved on your current health coverage?” one question asked. “Are you interested in alternative health insurance options?” asked another.

The survey also included questions about how much a seller pays in insurance premiums and what percentage of premiums fall on employees to cover. Amazon also asked about the complexity of choosing good and affordable health insurance plans for their employees and how satisfied they are with their coverage.

In the language of the survey, Amazon did not firmly commit to creating a health care or health insurance offering for its sellers and their respective employee bases. But the survey did end by saying “[w]e will keep you informed as we explore how Amazon may be able to support your needs better.”

In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson told Recode the company understands that its “selling partners are experiencing unexpected setbacks as a result of COVID-19.”

“Our Small Business team continuously works to empower seller success,” the statement continued. “As such, this survey is one of the many ways we engage with our seller community to explore opportunities for us to assist and support as needed and appropriate.”

The prospect of Amazon potentially offering some sort of health care or health insurance service to its seller community should not come as a total surprise to those paying attention to the company’s many encroachments into the health space in recent years, both on an enterprise level for its own company and employees, as well as on the consumer side.

In 2018, Amazon announced a joint health care venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Since named Haven, the venture is run by Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and New Yorker magazine writer, and it’s currently aimed at serving the million-plus employees of the founding companies and their families. Its goals are vaguely described on its website as “making primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable.” The venture says its hope is to eventually serve a wider customer base than just its own company staff. This year, the company launched Amazon Care, a virtual health care clinic for its Seattle-based employees. Amazon Care users download an app to connect with doctors and nurses for video-based virtual consultations.

On the consumer side of its business, Amazon purchased the online pharmacy startup PillPack in 2018 and has marketed the service to its Prime members. When Amazon first announced some of these initiatives, the news often sent the stock prices of publicly traded health insurance companies sliding.

News of Amazon’s interest in potentially offering health insurance-related products to its sellers comes as scrutiny mounts on tech companies who don’t provide health coverage to the hundreds of thousands of delivery people and drivers who make their services work. Amazon’s package delivery network, for example, relies heavily on delivery people working for themselves or mom-and-pop third-party firms.

But this potential new business line addresses a different group of people who do business with Amazon. The creation of a health care service for its sellers could serve as a third avenue into health care: a business-to-business offering. Amazon could be considering something as straightforward as an online tool to help steer sellers toward health insurance plans that make the most sense for their business, or it may be contemplating something more hands-on.

Either way, the survey is another reminder that Amazon sees the health care industry as one ripe for new business lines — even during a pandemic.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s been replicating like crazy over the past few weeks, spreading from person to person, city to city, country to country.

The coronavirus, yes — but also the mutual aid meant to combat it.

By this point, many of you may have seen the Google Docs, Google Forms, and other spreadsheets circulating online with the words “mutual aid” in the title. That’s a fancy way of saying we should all help each other get through this pandemic, giving what we can to neighbors and strangers alike. In these shared documents, thousands of people are jotting down their contact information and offering to do just that.

Because the coronavirus puts older and immunocompromised people at especially high risk, it’s a good idea for them to limit their exposure by staying home as much as possible. So healthy volunteers are signing up to go buy groceries and medications and deliver straight to their doorsteps.

In just a few weeks, such a vast profusion of spreadsheets has sprung up that some organizers have created meta-spreadsheets meant to compile them in one place. One such monster list contains links to more than 140 mutual aid groups spanning many US states, plus additional links for groups in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

“It’s a beautiful flowering of mutual aid,” said Cindy Milstein, a Michigan-based organizer and author who compiled the mega-list. “It’s a way to organize, but it’s also a way for people to remember the ability of humans to be kind and empathetic and dignified. People are desperate to help each other right now.”

Mutual aid centers around the idea that we should all share with each other reciprocally and that we can help meet one another’s needs in a self-directed, grassroots way, rather than relying exclusively on top-down government solutions that may come too slowly, or fail to offer adequate support to the most vulnerable people.

For communities that already felt neglected prior to the coronavirus — especially people of color and disabled, LGBTQ, and low-income people — there may be an extra layer of fear around relying solely on the government to deliver what’s needed during this pandemic. So it makes sense that we’re seeing a wellspring of mutual aid groups devoted to meeting the needs of these particular groups, such as immunocompromised people.

The flurry of activity we’re seeing now has robust intellectual roots. Mutual aid efforts have long been a staple of left-wing organizing, often operating under the slogan “solidarity, not charity.” But the thousands of volunteers who are signing up now aren’t united by a singular ideological commitment.

Some are religious leaders who feel their faith tradition compels them to fill in the gaps until a more robust state response can make sure everyone’s needs are met. Others are anarchists who don’t believe we should be relying on hierarchical government fixes in the first place. Most are simply people who are looking around, seeing a tragedy unfolding before them, and yearning to help their fellow human beings in any way they can.

The coronavirus mutual aid groups, explained

The number of mutual aid groups has grown rapidly; some states and even some cities have several of them.

Washington, DC, for example, now has more than a dozen groups divided by neighborhood, each containing the names of dozens of people and how they can help (“Whatever it takes!” some say).

One group started up when Alli McGill, the director of care at The Table Church, tweeted on March 12, “If you are in DC and are in the at-risk￼ demographic and need errands run so you can limit exposure — will you email me?” A few days and a thousand retweets later, her message yielded a far greater response than she’d anticipated.

“Instead of getting people who need things, I got people who want to help. I got 2,500 people,” she said. “It’s actually quite beautiful. There’s some real community-driven altruism springing up in response to this crisis.”

So far, her group has delivered groceries and medications to several dozen individuals in the DC area. Volunteers often pay for the supplies at the store and then get reimbursed by the individuals, if they can afford it. If they can’t, then a church fund pays for it.

The group also offers other kinds of help, from dog-walking to spiritual support. They make wellness phone calls to check on people’s physical and mental health, or “buddy up” for regular video chats to alleviate loneliness. Volunteers are busy papering the outdoors with flyers and distributing disinfected cards to neighbors to make sure everyone knows these free services are available.

The challenges of offering mutual aid during a pandemic

Thinking about how we can help our broader community, rather than just focusing on individual risk, is definitely the right spirit to adopt. That said, we can’t let altruism overtake evidence-based precautions. Volunteers eager to help vulnerable people might be carrying the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms, so they need to remember to listen to public health experts’ guidelines.

“I think it’s a good and even an essential service, as vulnerable individuals need basic supplies and they should be protected from exposure as much as possible,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “However, there is still a risk of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission that is hard to quantify.”

Rasmussen said that both those delivering and those receiving supplies should be vigilant about washing their hands and maintaining physical distance. Volunteers should disinfect supplies before delivering them, and leave them on the doorstep rather than interacting directly with the recipients or going inside.

Mutual aid group organizers generally seem to be aware of the recommended precautions. The Table Church’s group sends out the following reminder to all volunteers who sign up to make deliveries:

It is crucial to remember that when we’re fulfilling these volunteer requests we MUST USE RIGOROUS HYGIENE PROTOCOLS. Please bring and generously use hand sanitizer, or gloves if you have them. Wash your hands regularly. Do not volunteer if you’re feeling ill. If you are picking up/delivering groceries or supplies please wipe down the bag with some sort of disinfectant like Lysol or Clorox.

“You cannot eliminate risk, but you can reduce it,” McGill said in a phone interview as she drove to a senior citizen’s house to deliver food. She added that she believes grassroots organizing is a necessity right now.

“I don’t think the local government can handle running groceries to all the people at risk,” she said. “I’m compelled by my faith to serve — to try to be the hands and feet of Jesus.”

In addition to the challenge of ensuring everyone’s safety, there’s the challenge of figuring out how to do mutual aid without reinventing the wheel. When is it more effective to look to the organizers and organizations who’ve been doing similar work in a local community long before the coronavirus came knocking?

McGill, who sends out an email with volunteer opportunities each night, has been increasingly directing volunteers to partner with established groups like the Capital Food Bank and the Department of Aging and Community Living. At this point, she said, 75 percent of her group’s volunteer efforts are working with preexisting organizations in a complementary way.

But mutual aid groups can also offer other services that such organizations may not offer. “It isn’t just sharing material things,” Milstein said. “People are sharing wisdom about how to make your own mask or how to use 3D printers to make respirators.” Some are offering to connect those who need spiritual support with those who can offer it. “It’s existential and emotional, too.”

While a traditional charity and a mutual aid group might in some cases be doing the same physical activity — say, getting food to people who need it — what distinguishes them is the framing philosophy. A traditional charity pays staff members to give support to recipients; there’s a giver and a receiver. But mutual aid is an entirely voluntary exchange among equals, and it’s careful to avoid setting up a paternalistic or hierarchical relationship between them. There isn’t a giver and a receiver, because the assumption is that every single person has something to give others.

“It’s not about ‘I’m the savior and you’re the poor person who needs help.’ It’s about how we can reciprocally help each other without profit,” Milstein said.

The ways people help each other might not be equal in kind — it’s not like each person is giving the other the same resource in the same amount — but the idea is that that’s okay because we all contribute in different ways.

In this model, the older or immunocompromised person who stays home is contributing to our community-wide effort to stop the virus. Epidemiologically, that’s totally accurate, because they’re reducing the risk that they’ll end up needing hospitalization and possibly intensive care. That frees up beds for people who do get very sick to receive the treatment they’ll need in a hospital.

During the pandemic, anything we can do to ensure the health care system doesn’t become overloaded is an act of altruism — and that includes staying home and asking others for help.

Mutual aid has a long and fascinating history

In a very basic sense, mutual aid is something we’ve been doing for millennia. The desire to help one another directly and reciprocally is a basic human impulse.

But one approach to mutual aid comes out of a specific intellectual tradition, which predates the age of Google Docs and shareable spreadsheets.

In 1902, the Russian anarcho-communist philosopher Peter Kropotkin published an essay collection titled Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. He and his book are explicitly mentioned in some of the coronavirus mutual aid spreadsheets.

In contrast to Charles Darwin, whose then-ascendant evolutionary theory emphasized competition — think “natural selection” and “survival of the fittest” — Kropotkin argued that survival is based on solidarity, or as he put it, “the close dependency of everyone’s happiness upon the happiness of all.”

When he looked at nature, he noticed profound cooperation between and among species, and argued that these conditions are what enable us to thrive. His book offers examples both from natural ecosystems and from human social life.

“In his time period, they were building the railroad, and he talked about how it makes no sense for everybody to go off and compete to build their own little track — they wouldn’t connect up!” Milstein explained. “But when we cooperate, we can all move around.”

Kropotkin’s vision led him to issue a clear prescription: “Practicing mutual aid is the surest means for giving each other and to all the greatest safety, the best guarantee of existence.”

This prescription has long shaped activism among anarchists, said Milstein, the author of Anarchism and Its Aspirations. It’s also been a mainstay in communities that have often felt abandoned or marginalized by state institutions.

For example, the Black Panthers had a mutual aid program, including a free breakfast program meant to bolster the health of undernourished black youth. The LGBTQ community and the disability community, likewise, know what it’s like to have to rely on themselves for resources — and thus are well-practiced at organizing mutual aid.

“These are the groups we should be looking to now,” Milstein said, “because they actually have decades or hundreds of years of experience of having to rely on mutual aid to take care of each other.”

Of course, this isn’t to say that all, or even many, of the groups that have formed to combat coronavirus are driven by Kropotkin’s philosophy or its intellectual lineage. (Most people signing up have probably never heard of Kropotkin.) Some people have gotten involved through their faith or church; others because of their political or ideological commitments.

At bottom, it may not even matter much. Many people just want to help, and these groups have been a great vehicle for the pandemic-induced upsurge of altruism.

https://www.vox.com/,"Ariella Altman, a surgical resident at the University of Minnesota and mother of two, panicked when she heard that Minneapolis schools and day care facilities were closing for at least five weeks starting in mid-March in order to curb the spread of coronavirus.

Altman is contributing to the coronavirus response at the university hospital, which is the only facility in the Upper Midwest specifically designated by the federal government to contain and treat highly infectious diseases like Covid-19. Her husband, Ethan, works full time as a business analyst, so they didn’t know how they would take care of their children Gabriel, 4, and Jonathan, 2.

When Altman saw a link on Facebook for MN CovidSitters, a group founded by University of Minnesota medical students offering free child care to front-line medical workers amid the pandemic, she jumped at the opportunity and was approved for their services within a day.

“I immediately reached out, knowing medical students would be trustworthy and also conscious of socially distancing during this time,” she said. “We just wanted the best option for our kiddos.”

Now, a “pod” of students is assigned to the family so they can share responsibility for child care while also limiting the number of people who come into contact with the family in order to prevent the spread of the virus. They even helped Jonathan craft his own pair of goggles, modeled after the personal protective equipment his mother wears at the hospital.

For many medical professionals, these kinds of child care services are necessary to ensure they can continue to do lifesaving work on the front lines of the pandemic. Some states — including Washington, California, and New York, which currently have the biggest outbreaks in the US — are providing free or subsidized child care to essential workers. Others have allowed existing child care facilities to remain open, but many providers have had to shut down nonetheless due to decreased overall demand, limiting the options available to health care workers who need their services most.

Where existing child care facilities or the state hasn’t been able to provide services, volunteers have tried to step in. MN CovidSitters, which has over 300 volunteers serving more than 200 health care families, is expanding across rural Minnesota and has been contacted by dozens of schools looking to start sister organizations across the country. Similar babysitting networks have emerged at Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and Ohio State University.

“We have the urge to help where we can,” Kristin Chu, a second-year medical student and co-founder of MN CovidSitters, said. “We did a needs assessment to see where our profession needs us currently — the need for child care became even more present.”

Why child care for medical workers is so essential

At this point, all states have ordered schools closed for the time being, though so far only 19 have extended those closures through the end of the school year. Washington state, the epicenter of the first major coronavirus outbreak in the US, is preparing for even longer closures that could potentially stretch into the fall.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on April 7 that he is cautiously optimistic that schools will be able to reopen by fall 2020: “I fully expect, though I’m humble enough to know that I can’t accurately predict, that by the time we get to the fall that we will have this under control enough that it certainly will not be the way it is now, where people are shutting schools.”

In the meantime, however, Colorado State University’s Jude Bayham and Yale University’s Eli Fenichel found in a recent study published in The Lancet that at least one in seven medical workers may have to stay home from work due to school closures to care for children ages 3 through 12. They account for households in which older siblings and other non-working adults can provide child care — but not for households with children younger than 3, who need even more supervision.

Essential health care workers are defined as anyone who works at the offices of physicians or other health practitioners, outpatient care centers, hospitals, nursing care facilities, and residential care. That may include people delivering direct care to patients, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and medical technicians, and all the workers needed to keep a medical facility running, from administrative to cleaning staff.

Many of these workers can’t afford child care to begin with. According to the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, their median personal income is $42,340, but the annual cost of care for two young children is more than $20,000 on average. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found 22 percent of grandparents regularly provided child care at no cost, but now that option may no longer be safe because seniors face elevated risk of complications from the virus due to their age.

The impact of health care workers staying home isn’t just economic; it could also increase cumulative mortality rates due to staffing shortages.

“Health-care workers spending less time providing patient care to look after their own children can directly influence the development of an epidemic and the survival of those patients,” Fenichel told Science Daily. “Understanding these trade-offs is vital when planning the public health response to COVID-19 because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare workforce, then school closures could potentially increase deaths from COVID-19.”

State and city governments have tried to step in to incentivize medical professionals to continue showing up for work by providing child care services in some capacity. And many states have also allowed day care facilities to remain open and are subsidizing them to make up for lost income.

In places like New York City, child care is free at one of the 93 regional centers serving children of health care workers, first responders, grocery store and pharmacy workers, transit employees, and other city agencies. The centers have capacity for about 40,000 children as young as 3 and up to 12th grade, including those with disabilities. Children younger than 3 can continue to attend day care if their parents are essential workers, but many day care facilities in the city have shuttered amid the pandemic.

But in Washington, free child care options amid the pandemic have gotten off to a bumpy start. Gov. Jay Inslee had initially called on local school districts to start providing child care to essential workers, but it’s taken time for schools to adjust. In Seattle, teachers refused to show up, claiming it would put them at risk of infection, and in other districts, the programs still weren’t up and running as of April 7, forcing parents to turn instead to other local nonprofits providing child care.

Other states, such as Ohio, are issuing special pandemic licenses to day care facilities that allow them to stay open with reduced capacity to serve essential workers, though not free of charge. About 1,500 day cares were approved for those licenses as of late March, roughly 20 percent of existing facilities. North Carolina has similarly allowed day cares to remain open, but it is also offering to pay for emergency child care through May for health care workers under certain income thresholds.

Child care facilities are struggling to stay open

While many states have allowed private child care facilities to stay open amid the pandemic, few have done so because their customer base has disappeared now that most parents are caring for their kids at home. That means parents in the health care field may struggle to find child care providers if their city or state does not offer its own services.

According to a survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children and the Early Care and Education Consortium, attendance at day care facilities declined almost 70 percent in a single week amid the pandemic. Many providers said they couldn’t survive without a week of income and would have to close — in some cases, for good. More than 60 percent said they could stay afloat for no longer than a month absent government aid.

The US is already seeing massive closures of child care facilities. More than half of the child care facilities in Florida had shuttered as of April 11. More than 1,000 child care facilities in Washington, with the total capacity for over 48,000 children, had closed as of April 2.

Some states are offering financial support to child care providers who are losing income amid the pandemic. The coronavirus relief bill signed by President Donald Trump last month, known as the CARES Act, provides $3.5 billion in discretionary funds for them to do so, but experts say that might not be enough. Kim Kruckel, executive director of the Child Care Law Center, told Vox’s Anna North that the need is closer to $50 billion.

In Minnesota, for example, child care providers can apply for a monthly grant of $4,500 if they remain open and can qualify for an extra $1,000 if they serve children with special needs or who don’t speak English, or if they stay open outside normal business hours. Child care facilities with capacity for more than 10 children can qualify for up to $15,500 in grants.

But it’s not clear how many child care providers will be able to stay afloat for the working parents in health care and other essential fields — and for the rest of the public when the economy reopens.

https://www.vox.com/,"Bill Gates saw this coming.

“I rate the chance of a widespread epidemic, in my lifetime, as well over 50 percent,” he told Ezra Klein in 2015. “Something like the Spanish flu in the modern day — health systems are far better, so you think, okay, that wouldn’t be very bad. What we showed [when infectious disease researchers working with the Gates Foundation modeled the scenario] was that the force of the infection, because of modern transport ... within days, it’s basically in all urban centers of the entire globe.”

The world’s second-richest man (he recently lost the top spot to Jeff Bezos) has, in the years since he and his wife founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, made a name for himself in philanthropy, especially in the field of public health. The foundation funds vaccinations through programs like GAVI, which Gates set up with a $750 million grant in 1999 and which is estimated to have saved millions of lives. (The foundation’s support to GAVI has totaled $4.1 billion to date.) The Gates Foundation funds fights against diseases like malaria and polio, and in its first 20 years of existence, it has spent some $40 billion on global development and public health programs.

And when the pandemic Gates long warned about arrived, he got to work on philanthropic initiatives to fight it. He’s not the only one — many companies and rich individuals have pledged eye-popping sums to the global fight against the coronavirus. But Gates deserves special attention. He has more money than all but one, more experience working in public health and infectious disease response, stellar approval ratings among the American public, and — thanks to his early warnings about the disease — a resource that may be just as important as money: credibility.

In a February letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine, he urged the government to start a strong policy response at home, and to contribute to preparedness in lower-middle-income countries, which is where Gates has dedicated much of the $100 million he pledged in February to the coronavirus fight. He called for accelerated work on treatment and vaccines. He also laid out a plan for how to make sure a situation like this doesn’t happen again. On April 15, Gates committed an additional $150 million to testing, treatment, and aiding poor countries in their coronavirus response.

It’s the sort of response many people would have liked to see from the US government; the Trump administration was still insisting in late February that there was no cause for concern in the United States. It is catastrophic that the federal government has failed as badly as it has. Into the breach have stepped private actors — Gates leading among them — to address the problems the government has failed to address.

Billionaire philanthropists like Gates have attracted justified criticism, but it’s crucial to look at the good side, too: The crisis has been an example of how, at its best, billionaire philanthropy can do critical work that democratic systems are failing to get done. It’s fair to say that things would be much better off if President Donald Trump had mounted a competent response — and much worse off if Bill Gates weren’t around to help fill the void the incompetence at the top has created.

The Gateses’ fight against the coronavirus

One of the many early heroes in the fight against the coronavirus in the United States was the Seattle Flu Study, a Gates-funded research project that studied influenza-like illness in the Seattle area. The group spent most of February seeking permission to test the samples it had acquired for its study of influenza in Seattle for the novel coronavirus (government regulations prevented the group from using those samples for a different purpose, in this case tracking the spread of a new disease). Eventually, the Seattle Flu Study did a test — and found a person with coronavirus.

The state reacted fast once the detection of early cases was announced, implementing social distancing measures earlier than most of the country. The positive tests from the flu study resulted in cases being detected sooner, and might have helped the state react in time: It went from the nation’s leader in coronavirus cases to its current 14th place.

That effort is emblematic of many of Gates’s coronavirus response programs. Because the Gates Foundation was already working in infectious disease response and global health, it had connections with scientists and researchers and preexisting expertise in vaccine deployment and public health response. Confronting a new threat in the Covid-19 coronavirus, he has put those resources to use.

In the developing world, global health teams Gates has funded, like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), have pivoted to working on a coronavirus response as the virus has made their original work unsafe (they could spread the coronavirus) and created pressing new needs in the communities they serve.

“The GPEI will use our tools, our workforce, and our laboratory and surveillance network to support countries as they respond to COVID-19,” Dr. Erin Stuckey, epidemiologist and program officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said. “What that looks like will depend on the situation in each country and the extent of the polio operations that are up and running there — but in general, the systems we’ve built for polio eradication will help support things like coordination of response operations, surveillance of suspected cases, training for healthcare workers, and standing up data systems.”

The Gates Foundation, headquartered in Seattle, has done additional work at home, too. In March, it partnered with the University of Washington’s Seattle Flu Study again to explore home testing kits for the virus; the Food and Drug Administration has since banned at-home testing, but the team is working on a test that can be self-administered at a testing site.

The foundation has also launched the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to study the most effective treatments for the virus, with $125 million in initial funding. Already, it has shown some promising results. While most studies have explored treatments, some early studies launched by the accelerator have looked at prophylaxis — drug treatments that prevent people from getting sick in the first place, likely for health care workers and people at similarly high risk.

“We’re not expecting to find a 100-percent-effective solution right off the bat,” Trevor Mundel, president of the Gates Foundation’s Global Health program, explained, noting that other viruses like HIV, as well as other lung infections like tuberculosis, have proven most responsive to cocktails of several drugs.

“That’s why the Accelerator is looking to identify a shortlist of about 50-100 FDA-approved drugs, and then narrow this down to a few that could be scaled up. And what this will look like is, first trying to use individual drugs, and then of course combinations of those individual drugs,” he added.

Like the program it was modeled on — the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international collaboration to make vaccines available quickly when disease outbreaks happen — the Therapeutics Accelerator is an international project, with contributions from Gates as well as many national governments.

CEPI is also a Gates Foundation initiative. As you might expect, Gates has also started directing resources at finding a vaccine for the coronavirus. “I do think manufacturing, construction, a lot of things we’ll do, but large public gatherings may have to wait until we have that vaccine,” he told NPR last week. “Until we get a vaccine that almost everybody’s had, the risk of a rebound will be there.”

With that in mind, Gates has been airing another big idea. Usually, only the vaccine that is going to be used is manufactured. That means a delay in the rollout between when a vaccine is chosen and when it is actually available at the necessary scale.

Gates’s proposal is to build seven factories, for all the leading vaccine candidates, and manufacture lots of each of them. It will mean some wasted money, but it’ll be worth it to get a vaccine to patients sooner. He estimates this will cost billions. Though the foundation hasn’t disclosed how much it will personally be spending, a project of this magnitude will require other stakeholders — as have most of Gates’s public health projects.

“The Gates Foundation is working with a range of national and multilateral stakeholders who are funding the development of vaccines for COVID-19. Enhancements of global manufacturing capacity are clearly required given the population-level scale at which a COVID-19 vaccine will need to be given,” the Gates Foundation told Vox in a statement. “Many of the current vaccine approaches are novel and have never been scaled for a commercialized product. In addition, governments need to continue to provide important vaccines for other diseases while scaling a successful COVID-19 vaccine.”

On April 15, the foundation announced an expanded commitment to the global Covid-19 response, with an additional $150 milion in funding to help with more diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine research, as well as funding for Africa and South Asia, where countries are grappling with the spread of the virus without the resources to address it.

Billionaire philanthropy’s critics

Gates has, of course, attracted critics. That includes conspiracy theorists who believe he engineered the whole pandemic, possibly so that he can inject us all with a surveillance system as part of the vaccines. Another conspiracy theory has seized on the fact that a nonprofit Gates funded did a tabletop pandemic response exercise in 2019 that imagined the emergence of a new coronavirus. Needless to say, these are fictions.

But there are legitimate critiques. One line of criticism is familiar. Gates, it acknowledges, is plainly doing great stuff. But a lot has gone wrong in our society if we are in the position of relying on individuals to make eye-popping sums of money starting tech companies and then devote their retirement to bailing out the rest of us. Shouldn’t we have institutions that solve our problems more systematically?

And there’s a related critique, prominently articulated in recent years by Anand Giridharadas, among others: When billionaires donate to charity, they’re not just buying vaccines — they’re also buying good PR. If you think that addressing the most pressing problems in society requires changing how wealth works so there aren’t any billionaires, then this looks like a bad trade: We’re accepting gifts from billionaires in exchange for entrenching them.

This is the whole problem; it tells the story. the billionaires collectively own the government, fleece it, shrink it, render it impotent.



Then when gov fails, a billionaire steps in and we say, see, billionaires and corporations are saving the day!

So they step up to fix what they helped break. And we take it. https://t.co/9bXdClggoy — Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) April 8, 2020

When you see a virus donation by a company or billionaire, one question you might ask -- beyond whatever understandable gratitude you may feel -- is: Would this crisis have hit us as severely as it has had that money instead been paid as taxes or wages or worker benefits? — Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) April 6, 2020

But there are problems with this critique. In particular, it’s not low taxes that hampered the US response. The FDA didn’t refuse to approve private tests for critical weeks because it was short on budget — it was short on a sense of what was at stake. This critique also doesn’t acknowledge that the administration in power might not necessarily share everyone’s priorities for where taxes should go — witness Trump’s budgets, which have sought to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

From the top down, the official US government response has been slow, incompetent, and poorly suited to what was at stake. Abolishing billionaires would not magically make Trump more competent.

In that context, I find it hard to wish that Bill Gates had been taxed until he no longer had the resources he’s now spending to try to attack this pandemic. And until the problems that produced this government response are fixed, I’m opposed to tearing down the philanthropic safety net that has been there to catch us when the Trump administration failed. To be sure, Gates isn’t necessarily representative of his class. But the point remains: Abolishing the billionaire class hardly guarantees the kind of competent government response needed in a crisis like this.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that Gates has been touring the world advocating for increased funding for those agencies, and warning that a dangerous global pandemic might happen if funding weren’t increased. (More broadly, Gates has also pushed for higher taxes on the billionaire class.)

But that’s not to say there’s no space for accountability.

“With the prospect of catastrophic numbers of deaths, any effective response, no matter the source, is to be wished for,” Stanford philosopher Rob Reich, who criticized the dynamics of billionaire giving in his book Just Giving, told me. “When government is as ineffective as it has proven to be, responses from individuals, corporations, philanthropies, should be welcomed, insofar as they are effective.”

But, he pointed out, it’s important that we target our accolades at the projects that actually are effective. We don’t want to uncritically praise or uncritically criticize — we want to ask questions, elevate the best projects, and assign credit where it’s due.

“Whatever the source of a large-scale response is, we should direct scrutiny at it. Just as when [New York Gov. Andrew] Cuomo or Trump or [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom stand up to offer their own responses, there’s a critical and question-asking press corps debating whether their responses are worthy. So too should we be directing that scrutiny at corporations and philanthropists,” he told me.

So there are some good questions to ask Gates. Are vaccines the best focus here, when realistically the US cannot stay on lockdown until one is ready? Should there be more focus on low-tech measures like cloth masks and reminders to stay away from people? Even as we acknowledge Gates’s good deeds, we should continue pressing him and other philanthropists on these questions — in the spirit of helping identify what works, what can work even better, and what most deserves assistance from other funders.

Why good government is still needed

But for all the good Gates and other billionaires might be doing, it’s important to remember that it will not be nearly enough to meet the current crisis.

In a catastrophe of this magnitude, no billionaire can actually do a fraction as much as the US government can. If Gates liquidated all his wealth — no more vaccine programs, no more Gates Foundation — to distribute to every American, everyone would get less than $300 each. The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package spends far more money than all the billionaires in America combined could.

“This pandemic has unleashed an extraordinary philanthropic response. While significant, it is still only one small part of what must be a coordinated effort to beat this global crisis,” foundation CEO Mark Suzman said in an April 15 press release. “Philanthropy cannot — and should not — supplant the public and private sectors. What philanthropy is good at is testing out ideas that might not otherwise get tried, so governments and businesses can then take on the successful ones. With all sectors working together, we can avoid the worst-case scenarios of human, economic, and social costs.”

So the sensible role for philanthropists is not replacing the government. They can’t do that. It’s filling in the gaps — moving faster than the government, moving around bureaucratic red tape, making sure that good ideas break ground immediately instead of waiting weeks for approval. Gates pledged some initial money toward his idea of building seven factories for the seven most common vaccine candidates, knowing most of the vaccines produced would fail clinical trials, but he won’t put up most of the money for the project.

“The foundation is exploring using its catalytic funding to get the process moving, recognizing that any large-scale projects will require multilateral and/or government funding,” the foundation told Vox in a statement. As Gates has acknowledged, the factory plan will cost billions that even he would struggle to put up personally, so while he can donate the seed money to kick it off, it will only really happen if governments pitch in.

“From the perspective of a foundation,” Reich wrote in 2013, “successful philanthropic giving consists not in funding social innovations and then sustaining the most successful of them forever. Because the assets of even the largest foundations are dwarfed by the assets of the marketplace and of rich states, success consists in seeing proven policy innovations ‘scaled up’ by private firms or by the state.”

But Reich was imagining a process that took place over the course of years or decades. What’s happening now is that same process, but happening on the scale of weeks. Gates sets up a trial for therapeutics, and then the results are seized upon by states and by doctors desperate for insight into how to treat coronavirus patients.

I asked Reich if the events of the pandemic had changed his understanding of the role charitable giving should play in a democratic society. “I had written about philanthropy and defended it as a distinctive source of risk capital for long time horizons,” he told me. “In general, emergency responses are not the sort of thing where you’d want risk capital for long time horizons. And yet given the abject failures of the government, I’m glad they’re doing disaster relief.”

Foundations can’t do it all. But extreme circumstances like the one we find ourselves in highlight the need for their logjam-breaking, research-boosting, government-guiding role even in short-term and fast-moving situations — at least if the government is falling down on the job.

Update, April 16: This article has been updated with new grant information released by the Gates Foundation on April 15.

https://www.vox.com/,"Welcome to the latest installment of Vox’s Ask a Book Critic, in which I, Vox book critic Constance Grady, provide book recommendations to suit your very specific mood: either how you’re feeling right now, or how you’d like to be feeling instead.

Currently, I’m knee-deep in Robin McKinley’s Sunshine, one of my favorite old comfort reads. I mentioned last week that I grew up on McKinley, and Sunshine is one of her best books, about a coffeehouse baker who forms an unlikely alliance with a vampire. Right now, I’m finding particular resonance in protagonist Sunshine’s tendency to stress-bake her way through anything she does not want to think about. I don’t share Sunshine’s creativity in the kitchen, though, so I have been stress-baking chocolate chip cookies rather than the Death of Marat (a fluffy light pudding with raspberry and black currant filling). However, some beautiful soul on the internet appears to have pulled off a partial Julie/Julia Project with Sunshine’s baked goods, so maybe now is the time for me to learn?

But maybe you are sick of baking already and want to think about something else right now. I’m here for you. Tell me what you want to read, and I will find you a book.

The recommendation requests below, submitted to me via email and on Twitter, have been edited for length and clarity.

I have been trying and failing to pick up and get lost in a book ever since quarantine started. My attention span is shot right now, but everything I read either feels way too heavy or way too frivolous.

Lord, do I know this feeling exactly, and I have two strategies for getting through it. The first is to go back to a book that I fell in love with as a teenager that I have gotten lost in so many times before that my mind automatically allows me to do it again (see above). The second is to turn to really good, really rich short stories. Since you’re having trouble with books that feel too frivolous, I think the second route is the way to go.

Short stories don’t necessarily require less attention than novels do, but I find there’s less pressure in sitting down with a short story collection you know you can dip in and out of. You know you don’t have to retain any knowledge of the book’s characters or plot across multiple sittings, and you’re not expecting to. It lets your mind relax a little.

Your email mentions wanting to read something big and important, like Jude the Obscure or News of the World. Since you’re craving classics, I’d suggest Chekhov’s short stories. They’re some of the most technically perfect short stories ever written, and they contain plenty of thoughtful, important themes to linger over. Treat each story like a chocolate truffle and let yourself luxuriate in them.

Do you have anything on your shelves or up your sleeves for not only a grown woman living with her single mother because of coronavirus, but also dealing with her mother’s deteriorating mental state/dementia?

Oh goodness, that sounds very hard. You might try Anne Lamott’s first novel, Hard Laughter. She is most famous now for her books on spirituality and writing advice (Bird by Bird, etc.), but Hard Laughter is from when she was just starting out and her primary career was as a literary novelist. This particular literary novel is the book she wrote after her father was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In general, she’s very good at emotional honesty, so it might be the move for you.

I am an economics student and I would like to read a murder mystery solved by a handsome economist.

We here at Ask a Book Critic appreciate and respect the specificity of this request. Sadly I personally have not read any books featuring handsome crime-solving economists, and in fact the last book I read about an economist was Professor Chandra Follows His Bliss, which is very charming but features a protagonist who is 69 years old.

With that said, will I admit defeat in the face of my own limitations? Never! Instead I will do what any responsible journalist would do and outsource the answer to an expert. In this case, the expert is my dear friend Kirsten Carleton, a former literary agent who now works at the New York Society Library. Kirsten, who knows everything, recommends Michael Sears’s Edgar-nominated Black Fridays. It’s the first in a trilogy about the hard-boiled former day trader Jason Stafford, who uses his knowledge of financial crimes to solve murders. Take it away, Kirsten:

“Jason’s character is worth getting to know — a crooked Wall Street trader and convicted felon, but also a loving dad and a man in search of a second chance at a new career, a new life, and a revived sense of human decency. A former trader himself, Sears definitely knows his way around the world of finance, but he breaks it down in a way that laypeople can follow, while keeping the stakes rooted in the wider world.”

No challenge will go unanswered here at Ask a Book Critic, and that’s our guarantee.

If you’d like me to recommend a book for you, email me at constance.grady@vox.com with the subject line “Ask a Book Critic.” The more specific your mood, the better!

https://www.vox.com/,"The coronavirus outbreak first erupted in the United States in Washington state, and while New York has become the American epicenter of the pandemic, there are Covid-19 cases in all 50 states.

The pathogen is spreading across the country, along with positive tests and death counts. Getting control over the outbreak depends on each state’s ability to engineer an effective response, to slow the virus down and eventually contain it. What plans for physical distancing are put in the place — and how well are they followed? Can the state health system survive an influx of infected patients?

“Each region has its own socio-cultural reasons that contribute to the rate of spread and its own approach to dealing with that rate of spread,” says Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has been modeling infectious disease outbreaks for 20 years.

For now, the coronavirus appears more concentrated in urban centers, primarily New York City and its surrounding suburbs, as well as Seattle, Boston, and San Francisco. That’s where the virus first landed and it could flourish in those places because they are densely packed with people, who, for example, have been riding public transportation and therefore had more exposure to a stealthy virus that takes several days for its symptoms to show up. Metro centers all over the US — Detroit, New Orleans, Miami, and many more — have seen a spike in coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the US is still almost certainly undertesting in other parts of the country. To give one example, Connecticut has done more than twice as many tests per capita as Texas and Georgia.

Yet all three states have roughly the same number of positive test results, despite the latter two testing far fewer people per capita. Such a high positive test rate suggests that the real number of cases may be much larger than the official count.

As of April 16, New York has the most confirmed cases (about 214,000) and it also has conducted the most tests per million people (about 27,000).

Here’s how states, territories, and Washington, DC, compare based on number of confirmed cases and deaths, and number of people tested, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Using the latest available Census Bureau numbers, we also calculated the number of tests per million people in a population, to give a better sense of a state’s efforts in tracking the disease.

(Note: We have updated the chart to display “tests conducted” instead of “people tested” because some states are reporting a raw count of the number of tests performed, which may include multiple tests for the same person.)

State health systems have different capacities to handle the surge of Covid-19 cases. Some started the crisis with higher uninsured rates, particularly in the South, because they have refused to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. Now millions of workers are newly unemployed as the coronavirus economic crisis sets in, suddenly uninsured during a public health emergency. Some states have younger and healthier populations; others are older. Certain states have more hospital beds per capita than their neighbors, and funding for public health differs considerably among states.

“One thing that always strikes me about the American system is effectively there are, like, 51 American systems,” Ellen Nolte, professor of health services and systems research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Vox last year.

The coronavirus pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge for states

New York, Washington, and California were forced early on to take measures to curtail the Covid-19 outbreak, and some states quickly followed their lead. Others were reluctant to impose strict distancing guidelines, worried about the imposition on daily life and especially businesses. As of April 7, at least 42 states had statewide stay-at-home directives.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo moved to expand hospital capacity in his state; he also waived out-of-pocket costs for health insurance, and the state put out a call for retired doctors to volunteer their services to avert a hospital staffing shortfall. New York set up “containment zones” to contain local hot spots, where all the area schools were closed, and religious gatherings and other large gatherings were halted. The state is also radically reorganizing its hospitals into effectively one statewide system, in the hopes of better managing staff, supplies, and patients. New York, like many other states, initially hesitated to put out “stay at home” guidance, but instituted that policy on March 22.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee quickly ordered the state’s schools to close until the last week of April after the Everett nursing home outbreak. He also appeared uneasy about issuing a statewide “stay at home” order, however, though he’s since done so. California Gov. Gavin Newsom was the first governor to issue such an order (after several major metropolitan areas in his state had taken that step), and he helped convince some of the big tech companies in his state to donate much-needed protective masks for medical staff.

Other governors adopted more lax attitudes toward the crisis, at least initially. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt tweeted out (and then deleted) a picture of him and his family eating at a restaurant even though other states were starting to shut down nonessential businesses. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at first shrugged off calls to issue a stay-at-home order after pictures of college-age beachgoers in his state stirred up fears they would become vectors for spreading a virus that is generally milder for young people. On April 1, he changed his mind and finally issued a statewide stay-at-home order.

Hospitals will rely on states to increase the health system’s capacity of hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators, as well as the personnel to staff them. States in turn will need support from the federal government, as their tax revenue takes a hit in the economic downturn. The stimulus bill passed by Congress provides money directly to hospitals as well as funding for states, although experts say much more is needed.

The relationship between the states and the White House has been a fickle one in the crisis. President Donald Trump has insinuated states should treat his administration kindly in order to win more federal support. Governors have contradicted Trump over his speculation in mid-March that Americans could return to normal life soon; he has somewhat backed off such claims. And many states say that they are still not getting enough supplies from the federal government to make up for expected shortfalls.

States are depending on federal aid to increase testing capacity, too, so they can actually trace the outbreak. New York so far is testing people at the highest rate of any state, while there are other states with a growing number of cases (like Texas and Georgia) where the testing rates still remain low.

https://www.vox.com/,"Over the last week, from April 8-15, the US averaged about 151,000 coronavirus tests per day. At the end of last month, from March 25 to April 1, the country was performing about 110,000 tests every day.

The number of tests done each week has gone up, which is good. But experts say that’s far short of the millions upon millions more tests America needs to conduct every day if we’re to resume anything resembling normal life. Testing right now is not nearly good enough.

If the Trump administration is serious about starting to reopen the country soon and wants to avoid a lot more people getting sick, they need to fix the testing problem — fast. Because right now, we’re staring down the potentially toxic mixture of relaxed social distancing and insufficient testing.

To end social distancing, as Vox’s Umair Irfan put it quite plainly: “Test millions. Test early. Test late. Test over and over. Test until the whole damn pandemic is over.”

The path forward is clear, according to Umair’s reporting:

Following through on this would require a massive increase in government funding, huge numbers of workers trained to administer the tests, and the coordination of raw materials, manufacturing, and delivery across the entire global economy. It’s a costly, brute-force approach. But it may be the only way out of the expensive and blunt measures already deployed to control the pandemic, from social distancing to shelter-in-place orders. Right now, however, the US is struggling to test even 100,000 people per day, so getting to the scale some researchers suggest would demand a huge ramp up in capacity. Yet, they say, it’s possible to do it. And despite the immense financial and social costs of a national testing system, it may yet be the cheapest path to reopening the economy.

But right now, our testing capability is being restrained, remarkably, by two equal but opposing forces: supply shortages, which limits the number of tests that can be processed, and overly restrictive testing criteria, which curbs the number of tests ordered even when labs have actually more testing capacity.

”The system is decentralized and not coordinated,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “And the federal government has not stepped in to provide that coordination and help ramp up the manufacturing. Finally, we have such a testing deficit that we are playing a terrible game of catch-up.”

In both cases, the Trump administration and Congress could do more to fix it. More federal funding would help labs keep their capacity up, and less-stringent federal guidelines would allow doctors and hospitals to order more tests so everyone can better understand the scope of the pandemic.

As Brian Resnick and I reported a month ago, the testing fiasco started with faulty test kits getting sent out to labs. That problem has been fixed, thankfully; there are still some concerns about test accuracy, but that has been a problem for every country and would theoretically be mitigated if we were testing a whole lot more.

But now, testing is sluggish. Labs are either overwhelmed because they’re short on staff and supplies, or they’re sitting open because federal guidance is restricting how many people get tested.

Vox’s German Lopez covered the first problem late last week:

There is no widely accepted number for how many tests America should run each day, but the current number is generally considered far too low by experts. Jha put the ideal at 500,000 tests a day. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner and coauthor of the AEI report, suggested that everyone who goes to a doctor could be tested, which would amount to more than 500,000 a day. A Harvard model proposed millions of tests a day. Complaints vary, but labs say they don’t have enough swabs, test kits, reagents, personal protective equipment (PPE), staff, or machines to run the specific tests required. “Any one link in the chain of supply, any restriction in the chain of supply, can suddenly create a bottleneck,” Louise Serio, a spokesperson for the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA), which represents the private labs, told me. “No labs have, really, the predictable, consistent access to all the supplies we need, from reagents to test kits to PPE.”

Labs need more money, both for these supplies and to keep their staff employed, as their finances have taken a hit with most other kinds of medical testing sharply falling during the pandemic.

At the same time, Politico reported on Tuesday that some commercial labs were “now sitting with unused testing capacity waiting for samples to arrive.” The trade association for commercial labs, the American Clinical Laboratory Association, was practically begging for the testing criteria to be loosened.

“ACLA members have now eliminated testing backlogs, and have considerable capacity that is not being used,” ACLA President Julie Khani told Politico’s David Lim. “We stand ready to perform more testing and are in close communication with public health partners about ways we can support additional needs.”

The FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, was quoted saying the administration was examining the issue.

Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Recode’s Rani Molla and I update our estimates of how many people the US and other countries are testing. If you look back over the last month, the US has come a long way — but not far enough.

This was our chart from March 18, when the United States was embarrassingly behind:

And this is our chart from April 16. America has risen all the way up to ... mediocre compared to Italy (another one of the epicenters) and Germany (a model for good testing practices).

We have to get this right — and fast. As Vox’s Ezra Klein wrote last week, every single plan to relax social distancing and start to get life back to normal again depends on a dramatic increase in testing. Nobel laureate Paul Romer thinks we should be conducting 22 million tests every day. By that standard, the US testing capacity has barely budged since the last week of March. Even much less ambitious testing proposals remain far out of reach for the time being.

Setting aside the issue of scale, there is also little coordination in how the tests are being administered. Laurie Garret, a Pulitzer-winning author who has covered prior outbreaks, said we need a strategy for testing both the vulnerable populations (like nursing-home residents) and people who we want to return to their regular routines (like students).

”We need wisdom,” Garrett said. “Right now it’s nothing more than chaotic supply-and-demand.”

More than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths into this crisis and America still hasn’t risen to the challenge.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s easy to forget that just a few months ago, the virus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic around the world was not known, at all, to science.

In the months and weeks since, researchers have been learning as much as they can about this pathogen — and at breakneck speed. Scientists have sequenced its genome and begun to create vaccines in the hope of making people immune to it. They’ve also learned, critically, that people can pass the virus on to others before they get symptoms themselves. That makes the virus hard to contain. But it also makes it clear that severe actions — like the social distancing measures in place in the US and around the world — are necessary in the fight to save lives.

We still don’t know how this pandemic will play out. That’s in large part because there are crucial unanswered questions about this virus and the disease it causes. For example, researchers don’t yet have precise estimates of how deadly the virus is or an exact understanding of how it spreads. The answers to these questions will provide key insights into stopping this pandemic in the least disruptive way possible.

Related Scientists warn we may need to live with social distancing for a year or more

It may be too easy to look at these uncertainties and the lack of data and feel cavalier: Maybe this all isn’t as bad as people are saying.

Do not take comfort in these uncertainties. Take caution.

“The way we deal with the uncertainty is we have to cover all of our bases,” Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College. “A year from now we’ll realize some of the things that we did may not have been necessary.” But we have to proceed with extreme vigilance due to the many unknowns of this virus and the serious risk it poses to so many around the globe.

These are the nine most important unanswered questions about Covid-19 that will help determine the course of this outbreak. Be humbled by this list. We are. And take care.

1) How, exactly, does Covid-19 spread?

The virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — that causes Covid-19 has infected more than 222,000 people since its emergence. (Of them, at least 9,000 have died.) That’s just the confirmed cases. A great many more may have occurred (more on that later).

Why has it spread so fast? “The best explanation for this rapid spread is that the virus is being passed through droplets from coughing or sneezing,” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. “When these virus-laden droplets from an infected person reach the nose, eyes, or mouth of another, they can transmit the disease.”

But it’s still unknown how significant other modes of transmission are in spreading the disease.

It’s possible that the virus can spread through feces. (The CDC says, though, “the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses.” But if you weren’t already washing your hands vigorously after defecating, please do so now.). There are also uncertainties over how long the virus can linger in the air after a person coughs or sneezes.

You may have heard that the new coronavirus isn’t “airborne” — meaning that unlike extremely contagious diseases like measles, it’s unlikely to linger in the air for hours on end. But that doesn’t mean the virus can’t linger in the air for some amount of time.

As Wired explains, although some experts say the new coronavirus isn’t airborne, that’s based on a narrow scientific definition of the term. The virus can possibly still linger in the air for some time and under some conditions. As the journal Stat reports, we don’t yet know precisely what those conditions are. It will definitely be in the air in the moments after an infected person sneezes or coughs, but it’s unclear when the particles eventually come to rest on the ground (or surrounding surfaces).

“The studies suggesting that [the virus] can be aerosolized [i.e., linger as small particles in the air] are only preliminary, and other research contradicts it, finding no aerosolized coronavirus particles in the hospital rooms of Covid-19 patients,” Stat reports. More research is needed.

So all three transmission routes — droplets, airborne, and fecal — are still possible contributors to the spread of the virus. “Almost certainly, one of these is probably the predominant one, and the others might be minor modes of transmission, but we don’t really understand this,” Hotez says. Some good news is that scientists are figuring out how long the virus can live on some surfaces. Here’s the latest: It’s around three days for plastic and steel, about a day for cardboard, and less than a day for copper. This information helps direct sanitation efforts to where they are needed most.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

2) Can people become reinfected? And, if so, after how long?

Another huge unknown: Can people become reinfected with Covid-19 after they’ve had it? There are some reports of people in China and Japan testing positive after recovering from the infection. Though, to be clear, it’s unknown whether those people were truly reinfected or still just had low levels of the virus in their systems after they felt better.

“I would say that the biggest unknown is how potent is the immune response generated in an infected person,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, writes in an email. “How long would [immune] protection last? ... The answers to these questions are key to understanding whether herd immunity is effective.“

Herd immunity is when enough people have contracted the virus and become immune that its spread can be slowed and potentially stopped. If reinfection is possible, however, herd immunity may not be an option. (Also, stopping the virus via herd immunity is not an ideal scenario. It would first mean millions upon millions of infections and potentially millions of deaths.)

Right now, there’s limited research on the question of reinfection in humans. It’s just too early. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, points to a hopeful, if small, study in Macaque monkeys. The monkeys had been infected with the virus and then, after they got better, exposed again to the virus. Good news: They didn’t get reinfected. The study, Rasmussen says, “bodes well for vaccine development, because that suggests the virus — or viral proteins — can elicit an immune response,” and protect monkeys at least from reinfection.

Studies on humans will come in time. Researchers will be able to test the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the weeks and months following their infection and see if they still are immune.

But even if people do become immune, “one thing we don’t know about that still is how long that immunity would last,” Rasmussen says. “And that’s unfortunately not something we can determine until we wait months or years in the future, and test again and see if those antibodies are still there.”

For coronaviruses that cause the common cold (in the same family of viruses as the one that causes Covid-19), she says, reinfection is possible, but on a timescale of years, not weeks or months. Again, we’re going to have to wait and see if this also applies to Covid-19.

For now, at least, Rasmussen says, “I have not seen any data that is convincing that reinfection occurs.”

3) How many cases of Covid-19 are in the US, and where are we on the curve?

This is one of the scariest unknowns. Due to the continued lack of Covid-19 diagnostic testing in most of the US, we just don’t know how many cases are in the US.

“There’s speculation that there may be many mild infections who aren’t seeking care — or, even if they are, can’t be tested due to insufficient testing capacity,” says Harvard epidemiologist Maimuna Majumder. This obfuscates our knowledge of where the virus is, and how many vulnerable people may be in its path.

Repeating my plea to media: PLEASE stop saying ""there are now X number of cases in the US"" and start saying ""as of today X cases have been reported in the US. Because of limited testing, experts agree the real number is far higher."" We don't know how much higher but many times — Marc Lipsitch (@mlipsitch) March 15, 2020

As of March 19, the CDC said there were 10,442 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US. But viral genetic data suggests the real number could be much higher. Here is one estimate from a computational virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle (with a very wide range) from nearly a week ago;

I could easily be off 2-fold in either direction, but my best guess is that we're currently in the 10,000 to 40,000 range nationally. 11/13 — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 14, 2020

Another problem with insufficient testing is that we don't know where we are on the epidemic curve. How do we know when the worst spikes in the number of cases are coming? It seems we’re early, but we don’t know how early or how big the wave of future cases is. We need to know this to make sure hospitals are prepared for a surge of patients.

If we know how many people are getting the disease without symptoms or getting it at a level that does not warrant medical attention, scientists can make better estimates for how deadly the virus is and for whom, and they can refine their assumptions about how contagious the virus is. More testing can also help researchers determine the true role asymptomatic transmission plays in the outbreak, and what factors make a person likely to transmit the virus before they feel sick.

4) How deadly, exactly, is Covid-19?

Knowing the true number of infections that exist in the US or around the globe (or at least getting a better estimate of the true number) will help researchers determine another crucial metric about Covid-19: its case fatality rate, meaning how deadly it is.

Right now, it’s looking like some countries have higher death rates for Covid-19 than others. These rates also keep changing. Now, the estimated death rate for Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak began — is 1.4 percent, per a new study in Nature Medicine. In late February, the World Health Organization estimated the rate in Wuhan was 5.8 percent. South Korea, on the other hand, was estimated to have a death rate of less than 1 percent. Italy’s seems to be, for now, several percentage points higher.

Are these estimates different because the citizens of these countries are at different levels of risk for some yet-to-be-determined variables? Are their caregivers better at treating the virus? Or are their health care systems falling short in the testing of cases? All of these questions may be in play.

It’s also the case that the fatality rate can change over time, as Belluz explains:

CFRs do change over time. That’s exactly what happened in China, as you can see in this figure from the WHO. Even the first and hardest-hit province, Hubei, saw its death rate tumble as public health measures were strengthened and clinicians got better at identifying and treating people with the disease:

Crucially, it’s not just the overall CFR that matters but also the knowledge of who is most at risk for death. It does seem clear that older people — particularly those older than 80 — and those with chronic medical conditions are in the riskiest group for dying of Covid-19. But we need more knowledge on other subgroups so we can better protect them.

5) Is it seasonal?

For a variety of reasons, some viruses — but not all — become less transmissible as temperatures and humidity rise in the summer months. The viruses themselves may not live as long on surfaces in these conditions. The droplets that transmit the virus also may not spread as far in humid air. (When the air contains more water vapor, those virus droplets will collide with water molecules more frequently and may not travel as far. The humid air is kind of like a shield for virus-containing droplets.) Also, human behavior changes, and we spend less time in confined spaces.

“A lot of how the outbreak ends or at least how things progress in the next few months really depends on if this is seasonal,” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, says.

There are actually two important questions here. The first: Will Covid-19 show seasonal effects? The second: Will those seasonal effects make a meaningful difference in slowing down the spread of the pandemic?

The answer to the first question, right now, is maybe.

Mauricio Santillana, the director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, has been studying the potential seasonality of Covid-19 by looking at the best available data from China.

Before China instituted massive lockdowns, “we saw a signature that places that were colder and drier showed slightly larger transmissions before interventions,” Santillana says. Though he admits the data is limited, and it’s hard to analyze the exact impact temperature and humidity have on transmission. That’s because, once China locked down, it became hard to disentangle the effects weather has on transmission from the mitigation policies from the government. Santillana and his colleagues are still working out what exact effect the weather may have on transmissibility, and he says it’s too soon to report a specific number.

But be prepared to be disappointed on this. On the second question, Santillana is firmer: “We cannot rely on weather alone to take care of the outbreak,” he says, pointing to warmer and more humid climates — like in Singapore — where the virus has spread. “We think the spring temperatures will not be enough to mitigate the outbreak.”

It’s just too contagious — and too few people are immune.

That said, it’s not futile to keep studying seasonality effects. “This virus may be with us for the coming years,” Santillana says. Predicting spikes based on weather, however small, will give us “a more precise way to deploy resources around the world.”

6) What role do children play in the spread of Covid-19? And why aren’t they getting very sick with it?

“When there’s an influenza epidemic, kids are often some of the biggest community spreaders,” Hotez explains.

But with Covid-19, kids generally don’t seem to be getting severely ill. Which is leading researchers to ask: Are kids a big source of transmission of this virus? “When we’re talking about closing schools, we’re doing that under the assumption that kids are significant community transmitters,” Hotez says. “If we knew that one way or another, we could make a more informed decision.”

On this, the data is slowly coming in.

“We do know that children tend to have more mild infection, have more mild disease, but we have seen [at least one child] die from this infection,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead at the World Health Organization, said in a press conference on March 16. “We can’t say universally that it’s mild in children, so it’s important that we protect children as a vulnerable population.”

While kids usually seem to be spared the worst, so many questions remain, as Vox’s Umair Irfan explains: “A small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm,” he writes. “Few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isn’t much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, it’s hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young.”

7) What leads some people to be at higher risk for the worst symptoms of Covid-19?

On the question of risk factors, there seems to be one clear answer for the most prominent factor: age. Older people appear to be dying in much higher numbers from Covid-19 than younger people.

But we still don’t know a lot about what else contributes to risk. Even among older people, there are unanswered questions. Like why do men appear to be dying at higher rates than women?

Though the risks to older people are being emphasized, young people are also being hospitalized. New data from the CDC now shows that while Covid-19 is currently less than 1 percent fatal among those ages 20 to 54, this group makes up 38 percent of the hospitalizations so far (with 20 percent of the hospitalization occurring among those ages 22 to 44).

“It’s really an open question to try to figure out why some of these younger people are getting really, really severe disease, and if there are other risk factors that we are not appreciating,” Rasmussen says. “Some of that will just have to wait until we have really detailed clinical data on all the cases that are coming out now in Italy and in the United States.” Knowing who is most at risk, she says, “will help in terms of flattening the curve.” If we learn how to protect the young people most at risk and keep them out of hospitals, we can decrease strain on our health care system.

And a big part of keeping the health care system working well is ensuring its workers — who are often in this 20- to 54-year-old group — remain healthy. “We don’t understand why hospital workers also seem to be at higher risk for severe disease than you would expect based on their age,” Hotez says. “Is it just that they get exposed to a large dose of the virus? Do they have some type of susceptibility that we don’t understand?”

Currently, we don’t know.

8) How, exactly, did it start?

This is still a little bit of a mystery. Scientists know this virus jumped from an animal to a human, but they are not sure exactly how or where. “If you don’t understand where it came from, then it’s hard to make policies, procedures, to prevent it from happening again,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and Emerging Leader in Biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

It likely started with a bat — the genetics of the novel coronavirus suggest that it did. As Vox’s Eliza Barclay reported:

What researchers have to figure out now is how exactly the coronavirus jumped to humans: perhaps through a human eating an infected animal, or through humans being exposed to infected feces or urine. “All we know [is] its likely distant source was bats, but we don’t know who was between bats and people,” said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia and host of the This Week in Virology podcast. “It could be a direct infection [between bats and humans] as well.”

A lot of the evidence points toward the outbreak either starting or significantly gaining steam at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The more we know about how this virus made the jump from animals to humans, the more authorities can help make sure an outbreak with this origin doesn’t happen again.

9) When will it end? And how? Will it become endemic?

The response to the Covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating every aspect of life, and we’re already longing for it to end. But this fight may not end for months or a year or even more. It’s also possible that Covid-19 will become endemic, meaning it becomes a disease that regularly infects humans and never really goes away.

But there are so many unknowns that will determine how long we have to live with this:

Could a pharmaceutical treatment emerge that will prevent people from dying from Covid-19? (Many drugs, including HIV-fighting antivirals, and common, cheap ones — like those to ward off malaria — are being tested right now, or may be tested soon.)

Will one of the many vaccine formulations that have been created in recent weeks (some of those trials are already underway) prove to be safe and effective?

If no drug works to treat the virus or stop its spread, we may need to live with strict social distancing for many months, if not a year or more, to prevent hundreds of thousands from dying. Will governments support that level of sustained disruption to the economy? Or could we find an alternative, like aggressive testing coupled with relentless contact tracing, quarantines of those exposed, and isolation of the sick?

As we learn more about this disease, our approach to fighting it will become more precise. We may be able to find a balance between protecting the vulnerable and letting our economy and society function again. But for now, we have to confront the possibility that this virus will disrupt life for a long while.

“I think this idea … that if you close schools and shut restaurants for a couple of weeks, you solve the problem and get back to normal life — that’s not what’s going to happen,” says Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion, a book on how outbreaks spread. “The main message that isn’t getting across to a lot of people is just how long we might be in this for.”

But given that scientists have only known about this virus for a few short months, “it’s actually quite remarkable how much we’ve learned,” Hotez says. “We’ve learned more information about this virus in this short period of time than any other virus.”

The learning won’t stop. And because of that, hopefully, the spread of this pandemic someday will.",1
https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s failure to respond to the coronavirus pandemic didn’t begin with the administration’s inability to send out the millions of test kits and the protective medical gear for health care workers that experts say are needed to tackle the crisis. It didn’t start with Trump’s bungled messaging downplaying the crisis even as it’s worsened, nor with his mid-March insistence that social distancing measures could be lifted by Easter (he later backpedaled).

It began in April 2018 — more than a year and a half before the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, sickened enough people in China that authorities realized they were dealing with a new disease.

The Trump administration, with John Bolton newly at the helm of the White House National Security Council, began dismantling the team in charge of pandemic response, firing its leadership and disbanding the team in spring 2018.

The cuts, coupled with the administration’s repeated calls to cut the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies, made it clear that the Trump administration wasn’t prioritizing the federal government’s ability to respond to disease outbreaks.

That lack of attention to preparedness, experts say, helps explain why the Trump administration has consistently botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The administration has in recent weeks taken steps to combat criticisms about its slow and muddled response to the coronavirus. Trump has been appearing on TV a lot more, starting with an Oval Office address and recently with daily press briefings. He declared a national emergency, advised Americans to social distance, vowed more testing for patients and medical equipment for health care workers, and promised more economic relief to those affected by the crisis.

But experts say a lot of the damage has been done: The federal government is still only playing catch-up, as thousands of new cases of coronavirus are confirmed and the death toll steadily increases every day.

The first sign of a massive failure came with testing. South Korea, which has been widely praised for its response to coronavirus, tested more than 66,000 people within a week of the first community transmission within its borders. By comparison, the US took roughly three weeks to complete that many tests — in a country that is much more populous and, now, is on track to have a much worse outbreak than South Korea and other nations.

Testing is crucial to slowing epidemics. First, it lets public health officials identify sick people and subsequently isolate them. Second, they can trace that sick person’s recent contacts to make sure those people aren’t sick and to get them into quarantine as well. It’s one of the best tools we have for an outbreak like this.

It’s also something that the federal government has done well before — recently, with H1N1 and Zika. “It’s been surprising to me that the administration’s had a hard time executing on some of these things,” Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, previously told me.

But it’s the kind of thing that the Trump administration has screwed up, while instead trying to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Trump himself has tweeted comparisons of Covid-19 to the common flu — which Jha describes as “really unhelpful,” because the novel coronavirus appears to be much worse. Trump also called concerns about the virus a “hoax.” He said on national television that, based on nothing more than a self-admitted “hunch,” the death rate of the disease is much lower than public health officials projected.

And Trump has rejected any accountability for the botched testing process: “I don’t take responsibility at all,” he said this month.

Jha described the Trump administration’s messaging so far as “deeply disturbing,” adding that it’s “left the country far less prepared than it needs to be for what is a very substantial challenge ahead.”

Even as the Trump administration has tried to escalate its efforts to combat the pandemic, Trump has continued to downplay concerns. Recently, he’s suggested that social distancing measures — asking people to stay home and keep their physical distance from one another — could be lifted within weeks, instead of the months experts say is likely necessary. “What a great timeline that would be,” Trump said.

This kind of downplaying has previously worked for Trump, who successfully, at least politically, fended off concerns about his handling of Hurricane Maria, the opioid epidemic, and a host of self-inflicted crises, from his travel ban to the crisis at the US-Mexico border.

But in the current pandemic, the approach has left the Trump administration unprepared for the challenge ahead, whether it’s in the failure in testing or the administration’s inability to calm the public and markets as the novel coronavirus spreads. And all of this can be traced back to the Trump administration’s decision in the spring of 2018 to deprioritize the federal government’s ability to respond to pandemics.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s failures began years ago

When Bolton became Trump’s national security adviser in 2018, he quickly moved to disband the White House National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which President Barack Obama set up after the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak to lead federal coordination and preparation for disease outbreaks.

In April 2018, Bolton fired Tom Bossert, then the homeland security adviser, who, the Washington Post reported, “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks.” Then, that May, Bolton let go the head of pandemic response, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, and his global health security team. The team, the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, was never replaced.

At the time, the Trump administration and Bolton argued the cuts were needed to streamline the National Security Council.

But, according to experts, the work of a global health security team, or something like it, is crucial to responding to any disease outbreak. Since the federal government is sprawling and large, it helps to have centralized leadership in case of a crisis. That leadership could ensure all federal agencies are doing the most they can and working toward a single set of goals.

But it’s important to have this kind of agency set up before an outbreak. Setting up an agency takes time; it requires hiring staff, handing out tasks and expected workloads, creating internal policies, and so on. A preexisting agency is also going to have plans worked out before an outbreak, with likely contingencies in place for what to do. That’s why it was so important to have this agency in place even during years, like 2018, when disease pandemics didn’t seem like a nearby threat to everyone.

“The basic systems need to be in place for global, state, and local responses,” Jen Kates, a senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “When you don’t shore those up, you’re not starting from scratch, but you’re catching up every single time.”

The Trump administration has since put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of handling the coronavirus pandemic, building out a team that includes well-respected experts like Deborah Birx. But this is in reaction to the epidemic, instead of something that a preexisting agency within the administration was working on for years.

Even some officials within the Trump administration have voiced concern about the team’s dismantling. “It would be nice if the office was still there,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said during a congressional hearing. “We worked very well with that office.”

The cuts are part of Trump’s broader policy agenda, focused largely on trimming the size of the federal government. He has repeatedly proposed cuts to agencies, like the CDC and NIH, on the front lines of the federal response to disease outbreaks. Trump’s most recent budget proposals asked for similar cuts — and the administration has stood by them. (But Congress has generally denied such proposals.)

In the months before the coronavirus outbreak, the administration cut a public health position that was meant to help detect disease outbreaks in China, where the pandemic began, Marisa Taylor reported for Reuters.

Even without such cuts, experts and advocates argue the US generally underfunds disease outbreak preparedness and public health programs more broadly. Further cuts just deepen the risks of pandemics.

By repeatedly undercutting outbreak preparedness, Jha said, the Trump administration signaled “to the government and all the agencies this is not a priority. And that means that even other agencies end up not putting as much attention and energy on it. So I think this has been a longstanding problem of the White House.”

Trump, for his part, has defended his record, arguing, “I’m a businessperson. I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”

But experts argue that’s not how pandemic preparedness should work. “You build a fire department ahead of time,” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Washington Post. “You don’t wait for a fire.”

The administration has been slow to react

Even after it became clear that the coronavirus outbreak was becoming a global threat in January, the Trump administration has been slow to prepare and react. The common refrain among experts is that other countries’ actions, such as China’s draconian measures, gave the US a bit of time to do something, but the federal government has failed to get even the basics right in that time.

That begins, first and foremost, with testing. But as report after report has confirmed, the US has done a bad job in this area — falling behind its developed peers in Europe and Asia. While the US has dramatically scaled up testing in recent weeks, health care workers and patients still complain that they still sometimes can’t obtain tests even when symptoms are present.

Not all of this is necessarily the Trump administration’s fault. When the CDC rolled out its tests, a component in them turned out to be faulty. That was unfortunate, but it put a big spotlight on the CDC’s decision to use its own test kit instead of test kits other countries have used, reportedly in an effort to create a more accurate test. Since then, as Olga Khazan explained at the Atlantic, the Trump administration consistently failed to make things better, with reports of infighting making it harder for the administration to get its act together.

But this is exactly the kind of situation that proper preparedness, well, prepares federal agencies for. If the Trump administration had prioritized outbreak prevention before the coronavirus pandemic, it might have used the time prior to Covid-19’s appearance — or even January and February, when the global threat was increasingly clear — to establish contingencies in case something went wrong.

“These kinds of things are what you prepare for, why you do preparedness planning, so this kind of thing doesn’t happen,” Kates said. “Right now everyone’s playing catch-up to try to address these gaps, and every day matters. A good preparedness plan would be addressing that from the outset.”

This is, after all, something the federal government has done before for outbreaks, from H1N1 to Zika. A big difference from then to now is that Trump is in charge.

Recognizing the criticisms, the Trump administration has promised to try to boost testing output, including a partnership with the private sector. But while things are improving, the full rollout of tests will likely take weeks — eating up crucial time that could have gone to actually using the tests to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

One of the problems is Trump has consistently downplayed the coronavirus, comparing it to the common flu and claiming that his administration is doing a “GREAT job” and keeping things under control. Even when announcing his administration’s goal to get 5 million test kits out, Trump said, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.”

Some of that may be political. Politico reporter Dan Diamond told NPR host Terry Gross that, based on his own reporting, Trump “did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that’s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear — the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.”

Some of it could also be a result of too much optimism. Trump in February said of the coronavirus, “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” (As of March 25, the US has more than 55,000 confirmed cases, up from fewer than 100 at the beginning of March, according to Johns Hopkins University.)

In mid-March, as Trump more openly acknowledged the threat of coronavirus, he suggested that the country could pull back on social distancing efforts by Easter — in just a couple weeks. When pressed on why he chose that date, he did not cite any evidence or data. Instead, he said that Easter “is a beautiful time. It would be a beautiful timeline.” That timeline did not last long.

Trump has taken some steps as the pandemic has worsened

Trump initially focused his response to coronavirus on travel restrictions, first against China and most recently against Europe. While this likely bought the US a little time with China, the Trump administration didn’t use that time properly.

And in the case of Europe, the restrictions will likely do little to nothing. There’s one simple reason for that, Kates told me: “The virus is already here.” Since the coronavirus is already spreading within communities, the concern is no longer the virus coming in from outside the US.

Even conservatives have been critical of Trump’s response. The National Review editorial board wrote earlier this month:

[Trump] resisted making the response to the epidemic a priority for as long as he could — refusing briefings, downplaying the problem, and wasting precious time. He has failed to properly empower his subordinates and refused to trust the information they provided him — often offering up unsubstantiated claims and figures from cable television instead. He has spoken about the crisis in crude political and personal terms. He has stood in the way of public understanding of the plausible course of the epidemic, trafficking instead in dismissive clichés. He has denied his administration’s missteps, making it more difficult to address them.

In the face of all these criticisms, Trump has, at least in public, seemingly taken the crisis more seriously. He held an Oval Office address. He’s led daily press briefings. A White House task force released guidelines advising people to avoid public spaces and larger gatherings. His administration has, in light of declaring a national emergency, promised to take all sorts of actions to shore up coronavirus testing, health care capacity, and a tanking economy.

At the same time, Trump has continued to do things that conflict with what experts are saying. He’s hyped up an anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, that experts say we simply don’t have enough evidence for as an anti-coronavirus treatment. He’s downplayed experts’ warnings that social distancing may be necessary for months, instead suggesting that it may just be weeks. And instead of using press briefings to convey clear, actionable messages and let his own experts speak, Trump often uses his time at the podium to brag about unrelated issues and criticize the media as “fake news.”

Meanwhile, the actual policy response continues lagging behind. Beyond the lack of testing, experts often cite a shortage of medical equipment, such as ventilators, masks, gloves, and goggles. While the administration has said it’s using federal authorities and tapping into its stockpiles to get more of this gear to the places that need it, health care workers on the ground complain that they still don’t have enough — forcing them to reuse possibly contaminated equipment and choose between working in unsafe conditions or not show up to work at all. All of this at a time when the country needs to, according to experts, boost health care capacity.

“Even with the infusion of supplies from the strategic stockpile and other federal resources, there will not be enough medical supplies, including ventilators, to respond to the projected COVID-19 outbreak,” a March 21 letter from the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and American Nurses Association stated. “We have heard of health care providers reusing masks or resorting to makeshift alternatives for masks.”

Again, this reflects on the lack of preparedness: A shortage of medical equipment is one of the many problems government simulations and exercises warned about before the current outbreak. But Trump simply didn’t prioritize pandemic preparedness beforehand.

“The US … was not prepared,” Kates said. “A good preparedness plan would have helped address this and had things in place to allow for that increased need to be met.”

But the Trump administration didn’t quickly prioritize such efforts, even after it got warnings in January and February based on how coronavirus cases took off in China.

Other Trump policies could impact the pandemic

In the background of all of this, the Trump administration has continued to push for several policies that, while not obviously related to the coronavirus, experts caution could have a negative impact on the pandemic.

For one, Trump has continued pushing for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to reel back Medicaid with work requirements. With the outbreak growing, the US’s lack of universal health care has become an even more obvious problem: If people can’t get testing, they’re less likely to find out they have Covid-19 and take precautions to avoid spreading the virus. If they can’t get treatment in case of complications, they’re more likely to suffer, potentially spread the disease, and die.

The Trump administration seems aware of this problem, working with insurers to eliminate copayments for testing, stop surprise medical billing, and help expand coverage related to the coronavirus. But in many ways, the administration is working against problems that it’s also helping create by pushing to worsen access to health care.

The pandemic is “bringing to the fore the underlying challenges that we have in our health and social support system in the United States,” Kates said.

Another example: The administration has pushed forward on measures that will kick people off food stamps. This will not only lead people to suffer if they lose their jobs as a result of a coronavirus-caused recession, but it could lead to sick people going to work and spreading the disease, because they won’t have a safety net if they don’t bring in a paycheck.

“If you ask people who are very marginal and barely had enough money to put food on the table, if you ask them to not work and therefore not get paid, and choose between that and having to go to work and put themselves or others at risk, that’s a terrible choice,” Jha said. “And a lot of people are going to make ‘the wrong choice,’ and you’d understand why. This is not about just helping people economically; this is about fighting the virus.”

The Trump administration, for its part, appears to understand part of the problem here. He has signed a bill that’s providing economic relief to affected workers and Covid-19 patients — including paid leave, more food aid, and free testing — with more to come.

But his administration has also stuck to its other efforts to kick people off food stamps.

Experts also pointed to the “public charge” rule, which effectively discourages immigrants from seeking public services, including health care, by threatening their immigration status if they are “likely to be a public charge” by relying on those services.

“With an outbreak, that’s a recipe for potential disaster,” Kates argued. “You don’t want individuals to feel frightened about seeking the care that they need because they’re fearful of not being able to stay in the country or with their families. That would threaten the public’s health.”

Even if the administration doesn’t want to permanently back off these policy proposals, it could, Kates said, consider a moratorium. But so far, that’s not happening.

That reflects the lack of priority the Trump administration has given to the coronavirus pandemic, even as it rapidly worsens. If stopping the pandemic was the top priority, Trump could halt, even just temporarily, policies that could potentially worsen the crisis. But he’s not.

https://www.vox.com/,"In a climate of international conflict and turmoil, a disease begins to spread across the globe. It hits the United States on the way to becoming a worldwide pandemic. While most infected survive, the fatality rate is well above that of an ordinary flu. Eventually, one in three humans on earth is infected. At least 17 million people, and maybe as many as 100 million, perish.

This is not a prediction — it’s a description of how the influenza pandemic of 1918-’19 (which came to be erroneously known as the “Spanish flu”; more on that below) became one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, disease outbreak in modern history.

Comparisons to the 1918 outbreak have been rife since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in January. We recently marked the centennial of the 1918 pandemic, and fear of a repeat pervades discussions of the current outbreak.

But even granting that we are early in the history of the coronavirus outbreak, there are important differences between our current predicament and the Spanish flu. The underlying diseases are different, and from what we know at this point, the case fatality rate of the coronavirus is lower, by some estimates, than that of the Spanish flu. We also enjoy a much more robust public health infrastructure in 2019; in 1918, as Laura Spinney documents in her pandemic history Pale Rider, medical experts still hadn’t agreed that the flu is caused by a virus.

Other differences, like the advent of widespread passenger air travel and much deeper global supply chains, put us at greater pandemic risk now than in 1918.

But many experts caution that we should avoid comparisons to the Spanish flu. As flu expert Jeremy Brown writes in the Atlantic, “What’s most striking about these comparisons … is not the similarities between the two episodes, but the distance that medicine has traveled in the intervening century.”

Spinney concurs. “The Spanish flu is one of the worst, if not the worst, pandemic humanity ever went through, and it’s really anomalous in the history of flu pandemics,” she explains. “We’ve had 15 flu pandemics in the last 500 years, and the last five since the 1890s have been properly measured in a scientific way. None [but the Spanish flu] has killed more than 3 million people maximum.”

The “Asian flu” of 1957 and the “Hong Kong flu” of 1968, for instance, were both met with more modern tools of disease surveillance and had death tolls in the range of 500,000 to 2 million: big numbers, for sure, but hardly 1918 levels.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

A very, very brief history of the 1918 flu

As Spinney notes in Pale Rider, it can be difficult to pin down the exact origins of the 1918 influenza outbreak.

One theory has it starting on American soil, in Kansas, where it migrated from birds to humans. Albert Gitchell, an Army private and mess cook based in Fort Riley, Kansas, is sometimes identified as the first victim, reporting his symptoms on March 4, 1918. Unfortunately for the world, US soldiers at Fort Riley were at that point preparing for deployment to the Western Front of World War I.

A month later, Spinney writes, “the flu was epidemic in the American Midwest, on the cities of the eastern seaboard from which the soldiers embarked, and in the French ports where they disembarked.”

There are other theories, however. Spinney told me in a phone call that one theory tries to explain the unusual virulence of the 1918 flu by positing that it developed first in Europe’s trenches. Normally viruses decline in their deadliness over time because they need living hosts to keep spreading. That didn’t happen with the 1918 flu — perhaps, Spinney says, “because the virus might have got started in the trenches filled with young men who weren’t very mobile. They were stuck in the trenches like sardines for days, weeks, months. There was no evolutionary pressure for it to moderate its virulence.”

Whether it began in the trenches or ended up there after the arrival of American troops, the virus spread quickly to German soldiers and to neutral Spain. News of the flu was censored in most countries with war censorship regimes, leading authorities in Spain to erroneously think that it was alone in enduring such a brutal outbreak — hence the name “Spanish flu.” Russian POWs returning from Germany spread the disease to the newly created Soviet Union, and by May and June, various countries in Africa, as well as India, China, and Japan, all had outbreaks.

This is sometimes called the “first wave” of the flu, because while it had significant effects (particularly on World War I, where it weakened troops on both sides), it was not the debilitating crisis that we now remember as the Spanish flu.

The second wave, Spinney writes, began in August 1918 almost simultaneously in ports in Freetown, Sierra Leone; Brest, France; and Boston, Massachusetts. British imperial ships spread it around the country’s African holdings, and from South Africa it spread to the rest of the continent. In a matter of months, the flu was slowing down combat in Europe, spreading back to India, China, and Japan, and circulating through mass public celebrations of the war’s armistice on November 11.

Basically the only place not affected was Australia, but a “third wave” of the flu in late 1918 eventually hit there, too.

The second wave of the flu, in particular, had more brutal effects than typical influenza, not least because it was likelier than the ordinary flu to be joined by bacterial pneumonia. This, subsequent research has suggested, caused most of the deaths in the 1918 flu outbreak.

When all was said and done, the flu had killed between 17 million and 100 million. That’s a wide range. While today countries keep detailed records of testing and diagnosis for new outbreaks (as they’ve been doing during the coronavirus crisis), there was no such record-keeping capacity in the late 1910s. As such, research has to rely on estimates comparing actual mortality to a “baseline” level of mortality that would have occurred without the flu. Accurate actual death rates are hard enough to cobble together, given the unreliability of death records from the period, but estimating counterfactual deaths without the flu is harder still.

It’s hard to say when, exactly, the pandemic outbreak receded. The third wave, beginning in the winter of 1918-’19, subsided by that summer, and the virus likely lurked around for years, not causing pandemics because most survivors had been exposed and developed antibodies. The long-term health and economic costs were substantial. Economist Douglas Almond has estimated that people exposed in utero to the flu in 1918-’19 received less education, earned lower incomes, and were likelier to have disabilities than people who missed the pandemic in the womb.

Similarities and differences between the 1918 outbreak and now

The Spanish flu is frightening because it demonstrates that in a reasonably modern society, a pandemic killing tens of millions of people is very plausible. But that “reasonably modern” society was still much more primitive when it came to medicine and public health than the world of today.

Here are a few facts about public health in the year 1918:

We did not know that influenza is caused by a virus, and in fact the scientist Richard Pfeiffer had convinced most of the medical community that it was caused by bacteria; it wasn’t until 1933 that researchers proved conclusively that the flu is a viral infection.

Antibiotics capable of treating flu-related pneumonia infections (which are typically caused by bacteria) were 10 years from being discovered.

Antiviral drugs were many decades from being developed; the first came out in 1963.

There was no World Health Organization, and efforts to surveil and track the outbreak of new diseases were incredibly rudimentary.

Most countries in Europe were under war censorship regimes that limited the spread of accurate, lifesaving information about the flu outbreak.

For all the advances we’ve made since, what’s striking is how some of the measures authorities instituted at the time look very much like the ones we’re seeing with the coronavirus outbreak. Spinney told me, “They had the kind of social distancing measures that we’re still using today: isolation, quarantine, masks, hand-washing, staggering rush hour so you don’t have massive crowds in the metro and the streets. Those are techniques that are very ancient. People have always understood you have to keep the healthy and the sick separate.”

We must also weigh the massive strides in public health made since 1918 against the advent of global supply chains and passenger air travel. “We have a global population that is four times the size, and at least in the industrialized world, the populations are much older with respect to 1918, and old age weakens immune systems,” Spinney continues. All of that makes us more vulnerable, not less, to a pandemic like this. While antivirals are useful against coronavirus, we do not have a vaccine and will not for at least 18 months, somewhat limiting the public health value of our scientific advances over the last 100 years.

One way we can compare the two outbreaks is by looking at case fatality rates: the share of infections that lead to death. This is always difficult to estimate because there are likely more infections than have been identified by medical authorities. According to Johns Hopkins researchers, as of this writing there have been 111,363 cases of Covid-19 and 3,892 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 3.5 percent.

But you should take that number with a grain of salt. Countries’ testing protocols vary widely and many, including the US, have only tested a few thousand people while others, like South Korea, have tested hundreds of thousands. That means the denominator for the case fatality rate — the total number of infections — is uncertain, and might be undercounted due to lack of testing. In South Korea, the case fatality rate is currently 0.7 percent, suggesting that better testing might yield more accurate, lower rates. At the same time, as Julia Belluz explains, accurately measured fatality rates are also going to vary significantly from country to country due to differences in health system capacity, low- and middle-income people’s access to health care, etc.

The case fatality rate of the Spanish flu is often cited as 2.5 percent, but this is likely a dramatic underestimate, as science writer Ferris Jabr has written.

The most frequently cited death statistics for the Spanish flu come from Niall Johnson and Juergen Mueller’s 2002 study, which estimated the death toll at 50 million and warned that this might be as much as a 100 percent underestimate, implying a total toll of 100 million. A more recent 2018 paper by Pete Spreeuwenberg, Madelon Kroneman, and John Paget gets a much lower estimate of 17.4 million. If the frequently cited estimate of 500 million infections globally is correct, then the latter death toll implies a case fatality rate of 3.5 percent, but using a higher death toll of 50 million, the fatality rate rises to 10 percent.

This is a huge range of uncertainty. Given how imprecise our counts of total global infections for both the Spanish flu and coronavirus are and how imprecise our estimates for the former’s death toll are, it is hard to say anything definitive about how they stack up against each other in terms of case fatality.

The diseases also differed in whom they infected. The Spanish flu, unusually for an influenza, was less lethal for older people, perhaps because a similar 1830s flu outbreak granted older people still alive in 1918 some limited immunity. The coronavirus, by contrast, has had its most devastating impact in China on older people.

Both Covid-19 and the Spanish flu have already had massive effects outside of their immediate health consequences. The Spanish flu, many World War I historians agree, sped up the end of the war by weakening the ability of each side to field armies; it may even have affected the outcome, though the evidence there is weaker.

Covid-19’s economic effects might outstrip the Spanish flu’s, even if the health effects turn out to be milder, due to the economy’s move toward in-person services, hospitality, and globalized supply chains, all of which are vulnerable to an outbreak like this. Indeed, one effect in 1918 that is not likely to be repeated is an increase in wages in some countries due to a shortage of workers.

It’s natural to want to compare the two outbreaks, and it can be responsible to do so if the comparison is done with care and nuance. But it’s important to keep in mind just how severe the Spanish flu outbreak was, and that while Covid-19 could get much worse, it would have to infect several thousand times as many people as it has to date to match the Spanish flu’s reach. The Covid-19 situation may only get that bad if we fail to adequately adopt measures like social distancing, aggressive testing, and quarantining, and let it get that bad.

https://www.vox.com/,"For much of the past month, some commentators have defended the effort to promote social distancing, including the near-shutdown of huge swaths of America’s economy, as the lesser of two evils: Yes, asking or forcing people to remain in their homes for as much of the day as possible will slow economic activity, the argument goes. But it’s worth it for the public health benefits of slowing the coronavirus’s spread.

This argument has, naturally, led to a backlash, explained here by my colleague Ezra Klein. Critics — including the president — have argued that the cure is worse than the disease, and mass death from coronavirus is a price we need to be willing to pay to keep the American economy from cratering.

Both these viewpoints obscure an important possibility: The social distancing regime may well be optimal not just from a public health point of view, but from an economic perspective as well.

Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner released a working paper (not yet peer-reviewed) last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively. The three analyzed the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in the United States, as the closest (though still not identical) analogue to the current crisis. They compare cities in 1918-’19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later.

Their conclusion? “We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over.”

The researchers refer to such social distancing policies as NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions,” essentially public health interventions not achieved through medication, like quarantines and school and business closures. The key to the paper is their observation that, in theory, NPIs can both decrease economic activity directly, by keeping people in certain jobs from going to work, and increase it indirectly, because it prevents large-scale deaths that would also have a negative impact on the economy.

“While NPIs lower economic activity, they can solve coordination problems associated with fighting disease transmission and mitigate the pandemic-related economic disruption,” they write. In other words, social distancing measures that save lives can also, in the end, soften the economic disruption of a pandemic.

The data here comes from a 2007 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, where a group of researchers chronicled what specific policies were put in place between September 8, 1918, and February 22, 1919, by 43 different cities. The most common NPI the JAMA researchers identified was a combination of school closures and bans on public gatherings; 34 of the 43 cities adopted this rule, for an average of four weeks.

Other cities eschewed these policies in favor of mandatory isolation and quarantine procedures: “Typically, individuals diagnosed with influenza were isolated in hospitals or makeshift facilities, while those suspected to have contact with an ill person (but who were not yet ill themselves) were quarantined in their homes with an official placard declaring that location to be under quarantine,” the JAMA authors write, detailing New York City’s approach.

Another 15 cities did both isolation/quarantines and school closures/public gathering bans.

The 2007 paper found a strong association between the number and duration of NPIs and pandemic deaths, with more and longer-lasting NPIs associated with a smaller death toll. Correia, Luck, and Verner, in their new paper, replicate this finding.

But they take it a step further. They study the impact of changes in mortality due to the 1918 pandemic on economic outcomes.

“The increase in mortality from the 1918 pandemic relative to 1917 mortality levels (416 per 100,000) implies a 23 percent fall in manufacturing employment, 1.5 percentage point reduction in manufacturing employment to population, and an 18 percent fall in output,” they conclude. In other words, a big outbreak spelled economic disaster for affected cities.

Then they combined this analysis with an analysis of the effects of NPI policies. They find that the introduction of social distancing policies is associated with more positive outcomes in terms of manufacturing employment and output. Cities with faster introductions of these policies (one standard deviation faster, to be technical) had 4 percent higher employment after the pandemic had passed; ones with longer durations had 6 percent higher employment after the disaster.

The takeaway is clear: These policies not only led to better health outcomes, they in turn led to better economic outcomes. Pandemics are very bad for the economy, and stopping them is good for the economy.

A few notes of caution

It’s important to always approach this kind of study with a degree of skepticism. The 1918 pandemic was not a planned experiment, so researchers’ ability to determine the degree to which the pandemic, or the policies adopted in response to it, affected economic outcomes is always going to be somewhat limited.

The researchers acknowledge that their biggest limitation is the non-randomness of policy adoption by cities. Presumably cities with strict responses to the pandemic were different from cities with laxer responses in ways that went beyond this one incident. Maybe the stricter cities had better public health infrastructure to begin with, for instance, which could exaggerate the estimated effect of social distancing interventions.

The authors argue that because the second and most fatal wave of the 1918 pandemic spread mostly from east to west, geographically, these kinds of dynamics weren’t at play. “Given the timing of the influenza wave, cities that were affected later appeared to have implemented NPIs sooner as they were able to learn from cities that were affected in the early stages of the pandemic,” they note.

The best explanation of differences in policies, then, is how far a city is from the East Coast of the US. They control for a big factor that might affect Western states more (the boom and bust of the agricultural industry as World War I drew to a close) and find few other observable differences between Western cities with strong policies and Eastern policies with weak ones. But the notion that these cities are comparable is a key part of the paper’s research design, and one worth digging into as the paper goes through peer review and revisions.

The economy isn’t everything

The message that there isn’t a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy is reassuring. If there were such a trade-off, the debate over coronavirus response would be in the realm of pure values: How much money should we be willing to forsake to save a human life? That’s a thorny choice, and finding that we don’t actually have to make it — as this paper suggests — is comforting.

It’s worth emphasizing, though, that if we did have to make that choice, it would still be an easy decision. The lives saved would be worth more.

In another recent white paper, UChicago’s Michael Greenstone and Vishan Nigam estimate the social value of social distancing policies, relative to a baseline where we endure an untrammeled pandemic. To simulate the two scenarios, they rely on the influential Imperial College London model of the coronavirus pandemic — a paper that found that an uncontrolled spread of coronavirus would kill 2.2 million Americans.

Then they throw in an oft-used tool of cost-benefit economic analysis: the value of a statistical life (VSL). Popularized by Vanderbilt economist Kip Viscusi, VSL involves putting a dollar value on a human life by estimating the implicit value that people in a given society place on continuing to live based on their willingness to pay for services that reduce their risk of dying.

Usually, this involves a “revealed preferences” approach. A 2018 paper by Viscusi, for example, used, among other data sources, Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries to measure how much more, in practice, US workers demand to be paid to take jobs that carry a higher risk of death.

Greenstone and Nigam allow VSL to vary with age — understandably, older people are less willing to pay to reduce their odds of death than younger people — but set the average VSL for an American age 18 and over to $11.5 million.

Based on the Imperial College projection that social distancing would save about 1.76 million lives over the next six months, Greenstone and Nigam estimate that the economic value of the policy is $7.9 trillion, larger than the entire US federal budget and greater than a third of GDP. The value is about $60,000 per US household. Even if the Imperial College model is off by 60 percent and the no-social-distancing scenario is less deadly than anticipated, the aggregate benefits are still $3.6 trillion. And this is likely an underestimate that ignores other costs of a large-scale outbreak to society; it focuses solely on mortality benefits.

VSL is sometimes attacked from the left as craven, a reductio ad absurdum of economistic reasoning trampling over everything, including the value of human life itself. But coronavirus helps illustrate how VSL can work in the opposite direction. Human life is so valuable in these terms that social distancing would have to force a 33 percent drop in US GDP before you could start to plausibly argue that the cure is worse than the disease.

That social distancing likely won’t cause a reduction in GDP relative to a scenario where there’s a multimillion-person death toll, as indicated by the 1918 flu paper, makes the case for distancing policies that much stronger.

https://www.vox.com/,"The political climate in the US is tumultuous. The Covid-19 pandemic hangs over everything even as a dozen other issues — an oil crisis, a divided Democratic Party, and a corrupt, impeached president — compete for our scant remaining attention.

Into that muddle, I would like to introduce what I hope is a note of clarity, a fixed point around which all Americans of good faith ought to be able to rally.

To wit: Americans need to have safe, free, and fair federal elections in November.

The date of the election is in law and can’t be changed without an act of Congress. The country is in a fragile, distrustful place already, and a chaotic election viewed by large swathes of the population as illegitimate could tip it over into a full-fledged constitutional crisis or even violence. This is a make-or-break issue for the country.

There is no way to stop Trump from characterizing the election as compromised; he accuses opponents of fraud in all elections, whether he wins or not. He has already tried to cheat in the 2020 election — got impeached for it just a couple of months/centuries ago — and will undoubtedly continue trying, even as he ramps up accusations against Democrats. He assumes Democrats will do the exact same thing: cheat and accuse him of cheating.

His tweet Wednesday morning captured his argument succinctly:

Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2020

And where Trump goes, right-wing state media, led by Fox, dutifully follow. They will back him up with conspiracy theories about voter fraud that at least some large part of the core conservative base will believe.

But what happens around the margins matters. Committed partisans will line up the same way regardless of the fact that voting is not partisan (Utah, a red state, has a 100 percent vote-by-mail system.) But that leaves a large, fuzzy, semi-engaged class of voters whose opinion of the election will be shaped by their personal experience and the signals they receive from trusted sources about the validity of the process.

The best way for Democrats to ensure that November’s elections are viewed as free and fair amid a coronavirus pandemic is to make them so. The best way to make them so, in the time remaining, is to implement universal access to postage-paid mail-in ballots with extended deadlines, serviced by a funded and functional Postal Service. (This is not the only reform needed, but it is the backbone.)

The only way for Democrats to secure that policy is to make it non-negotiable bottom line — a condition of voting through any further stimulus bills. This would be a tough political strategy to follow through on, running counter to national Democrats’ institutional timidity and fears about holding up cash and unemployment for those who really need it. They would be attacked ruthlessly by the right and mau-maued endlessly by the centrist pundits whose opinions they so prize.

But it is the right thing to do on the merits, so they should do it, and defend it without apology. This ought to be a messaging war they can win. If not, what good are they?

It might seem obvious to say that free and fair elections are important in a democracy. But this year, they are by no means assured.

Without reform, elections will be an entirely foreseeable disaster

Experts say social distancing could last six months or more, and even after that, it’s possible that the virus could periodically return in various cities or regions, occasioning new stay-at-home orders. Even South Korea and Singapore, places where the virus response has been considered exemplary, which thought they might be reaching the far end, are now reinstituting social distancing measures. Without a vaccine, there is no certain plan, anywhere in the world, for how to emerge on the other side of this thing.

Compared to those two countries, the US’s response has been a fiasco. The US has more than 12,000 reported deaths, the third-highest count in the world after Italy and Spain. The US is woefully behind in testing and tracking, the two key tools for bringing the virus under control. And there is still no coherent federal plan to secure needed medical supplies, ramp up testing, or bring social distancing to a safe end.

It may simply not be safe to go out and vote in person, among crowds of other people, in November.

For those curious about the person in this picture: Jennifer Taff requested but never received an absentee ballot. She spent hours in line to vote despite the risk to herself and her father who has lung cancer: ""I'm disgusted.""https://t.co/PE5Z04jZEw pic.twitter.com/XWYI1gnpg0 — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) April 8, 2020

Unless changes are made, the elections will thrust a choice upon millions of Americans, especially those from the most vulnerable populations (the elderly, people of color, people with chronic medical conditions): vote and put your safety at risk, or skip voting to stay safe.

No democracy worth the name can allow that to happen.

Republicans have recently become convinced that voting by mail is corrupt and a partisan issue

Voting by mail is not designed to give one party or the other an advantage. “It’s not partisan,” says Amber McReynolds, CEO for the National Vote At Home Institute, “it’s about making sure every voter can vote in a secure, effective, and safe way.” (More on this below.)

Nonetheless, it is clear that someone or some organization on the right has recently been working to convince Republicans otherwise.

When Democrats suggested voting reform for the phase 3 stimulus bill, Trump warned of “levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

In a recent interview discussing Georgia’s upcoming primary election, state House Speaker David Ralston conceded that, if every voter got a mail-in absentee ballot, it “will certainly drive up turnout,” but that would be “extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.”

Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander contended that forcing voters to risk their lives is preferable to voting by mail. “Around the world we’ve had people in new democracies go to vote when their lives were at risk because the right to vote was so precious,” said the mordant lawmaker. “Most Americans would be very skeptical of significant changes in our ability to go cast a ballot in person, certainly at this point.”

The House’s foremost Trump supplicant, Thomas Massie, even tweeted that “universal vote by mail would be the end of our republic as we know it.”

The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel reports several more examples of Republicans across the country attacking mail-in voting — mainly, it seems, because groups they view as liberal, including Democrats, support it.

When pressed, conservatives will generally say that they oppose mail-in voting because of the potential for fraud. But it’s clear that what they really fear is more people (the wrong people) voting.

Both fears are misplaced.

Voting by mail is not partisan

The US Election Assistance Commission releases a yearly Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). The 2018 edition reports on the state of mail-in voting and early voting:

All states allow for some form of by-mail voting and in-person early voting for at least some segments of their domestic civilian population, although how that happens in practice varies widely. Three states [Colorado, Oregon, and Washington] administer their elections entirely by mail and four states have all-by-mail voting in select local jurisdictions. About one-quarter of states require in-person early voters to provide an excuse. Almost one-third of states have vote centers or allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their jurisdiction.

As the 2017 EAVS report showed, the percentage of Americans early, absentee, or mail voting doubled from 24.9 million in 2004 to 57.2 million in 2016, to roughly two out of every five ballots cast.

By 2018, the percentage voting by mail reached almost 26 percent, more than one out of every four American voters.

The trend is particularly pronounced in the West, where 68 percent of voters voted by mail in 2018.

Analysts expected those numbers to rise in 2020. Since 2018, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Virginia have moved to no-excuse absentee ballots, California has shifted to 100 percent mail-in voting for over half its population, and Hawaii has gone 100 percent. Gerry Langeler, director of communications and research at the National Vote at Home Institute, told me that, in the absence of the virus, they were expecting mail-in voting numbers to hit the mid-70s in the West and around 30 percent nationally in 2020. (Now, with the virus, no one knows for sure.)

That’s almost a third of the population, and not all in blue states. Utah has a 100 percent mail-in voting system. Counties had to opt in; the final county did so last year. (This Washington Monthly story recounts the patient expansion.)

“Being a very red state,” Utah director of elections Justin Lee told Weigel, “we haven’t seen anything that helps one party over another at all.”

Red Nebraska allows any county with 10,000 residents or less to shift to mail-in voting. “Rural parts of the country benefit tremendously from this kind of system,” says McReynolds; it can save rural residents from long drives to polling places. In the 2018 election, statewide voter turnout in Nebraska averaged 58 percent; turnout in the four counties with mail-in voting averaged 71 percent.

In red North Dakota, 31 of 53 counties have shifted to mail-in voting. Even red Texas allows no-excuse access to mail-in absentee ballots ... for voters 65 and older. (Like Medicare, but for accessible voting!)

Another fan: Donald Trump, who voted absentee in Florida a few weeks ago.

President Trump: ""I think mail-in voting is horrible, it's corrupt.""



Reporter: ""You voted by mail in Florida's election last month, didn't you?""



Trump: ""Sure. I can vote by mail""



Reporter: ""How do you reconcile with that?""



Trump: ""Because I'm allowed to."" pic.twitter.com/Es8ZNyB3O1 — MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 7, 2020

Mail-in voting has increased turnout in those red states just as it has in blue states, and there is no evidence that it has increased turnout disproportionately among Democratic voters.

Rather, vote-by-mail primarily seems to increase turnout among low-propensity voters without strong partisan attachments (unaffiliated voters, or UAFs).

It was long conventional wisdom in US politics that UAFs tended to vote Democratic when they showed up, because UAFs tend to be clustered in vulnerable populations. But as long-time political strategist and analyst Celinda Lake says, “that can include people of color in inner cities, but it can also include white people in trailer parks in North Carolina.” It was Trump himself, she says, who overturned the conventional wisdom.

In 2016, increased turnout brought UAFs off the sidelines into his camp, not Clinton’s. The same could happen in 2020. After all, the group among which mail-in voting seems to most increase turnout is voters 65 and older. That is not exactly a stalwart Democratic demographic.

There’s just no evidence that mail-in voting disproportionately benefits Democrats. A February 2020 survey of 12,000 non-voters by the Knight Foundation concluded that, “if they all voted in 2020, non-voters would add an almost equal share of votes to Democratic and Republican candidates.”

Regardless, that shouldn’t be the point. “This intertwining of election policies and procedures with partisan outcomes not helpful to anybody,” says McReynolds. “It’s who votes, not who wins.”

With mail-in voting, more people vote. And they love it. Rozan Mitchell, previously election director of Salt Lake County, told the Monthly: “I didn’t realize how important that was to some people, that they could take that ballot they got in the mail, sit down at the kitchen table, and really study out the issues. I feel like vote-by-mail voters are much more informed than the average voter who would just show up on Election Day.”

No county or state that has adopted mail-in voting, red or blue, wants to go back.

Voting by mail is not corrupt

Trump keeps saying that voting by mail makes cheating easy. That is false. In fact, it makes cheating incredibly difficult. Phil Keisling, the former Oregon secretary of state who introduced that state’s mail-in voting system, explains why:

Mail-based voting systems today are far less risky than most polling place elections, precisely because they distribute ballots (and electoral risk) in such a decentralized way. To have any reasonable chance of success, an organized effort to defraud a mail-based system and its safeguards must involve hundreds (if not thousands) of separate acts, all of them individual felonies, that must both occur and go undetected to have any chance of success. Contrast that to the risks inherent in polling place elections that increasingly rely on direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting systems and proprietary software systems that both record and tally votes. A single successful software hack potentially could affect thousands of votes. It’s the difference between “retail” fraud and “wholesale” fraud.

Vote-by-mail makes wholesale fraud all but impossible. Voters hand mark paper ballots and receive a stub with a code that allows them to track their ballot as it proceeds through the system and ensure that it is properly tallied. It is a trackable paper system — just what election security experts recommend. (As long as it is done well, of course; design matters.)

Because this system doesn’t take place in a private polling booth, people tend to imagine lurid scenarios whereby abusive husbands, controlling pastors, or other bad actors control or otherwise influence other people’s votes. So it’s important to note is that in well-designed mail-in voting systems, anyone who wants to can, any time before election day, go to a polling place, report that their vote was coerced (or just mistaken), and request a replacement ballot. There are mechanisms in place to record and track any such problems, but they just don’t seem to happen on any appreciable scale. (Here the conservative Heritage Foundation struggles to build a pair of dubiously sourced stories from 20 years ago into a case that mail-in voting causes fraud; you can decide whether it’s convincing.)

The only serious modern case of election chicanery associated with mail-in voting was perpetrated by, you guessed it, Republicans. As the New York Times reported, Republican nominee Mark Harris contracted with operative L. McCrae Dowless Jr. in a scheme so blatant even his son thought he should step down over it. And it wasn’t voter fraud, it was GOP operatives defrauding voters, mishandling absentee ballots in an election they were supposed to be fairly administering. And they were caught!

This isn’t the place to completely rehash the case for vote-by-mail; I explained it more fully in a post from 2017 and another from 2018. Suffice it to say, mail-in voting systems have a well-established record, are used regularly by tens of millions of Americans without incident, consistently boost turnout, and are enduringly popular where they have been implemented.

And there is simply no other way to ensure everyone access to voting without forcing them into crowded polling places.

Democrats should go to the mat for voting reform

Democrats have limited leverage in Washington, DC, right now, but they do have some.

It’s clear by now that the $2 trillion recovery package that Congress passed last week is simply not going to be enough. Unemployment is skyrocketing to its highest levels ever, GDP is falling faster than it ever has, and the virus hasn’t even arrived in many places in earnest. There will be much more economic pain and dislocation ahead, and demand for Congress to do more. Already talk of a phase 4 stimulus has begun.

Democrats don’t seem to have internalized this, but Republicans need the next stimulus bill more than they do. Trump can spin every day from his press briefings, and he has a massive media machine that will work to shield him from accountability, but hundreds of thousands of deaths and a historic depression are what they are. Political science shows that voters tend to hold the party in power responsible for their circumstances, especially in the run-up to an election. (Though as political scientist Larry Bartels, the source of much of that research, told me, “no one really knows whether past experience is relevant in our current circumstances.”)

If there’s no additional stimulus after phase 3, the suffering will be vast and unrelenting and Republicans are likely to catch the brunt of the blame. They know this. So whether they admit it or not, they need to pass another stimulus bill.

Democrats control the House of Representatives, so no bill passes unless they agree. That gives them leverage.

I agree with @ewarren that our response to the COVID-19 crisis must include a robust plan to protect the right to vote, and in fact, make it easier to vote.https://t.co/bgWZomzt3j — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2020

I wrote a long post about some of the things that ought to be included in such a bill (or bills), focusing on long-term investments to accelerate the shift to clean energy. But if I had to pick one issue that Democrats should absolutely insist on — one package of reforms without which they should refuse to pass a bill — it would be voting reform.

Vote-by-mail is not a silver bullet or the only voting reform needed. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have introduced a bill with a package of emergency voting reforms. The Defending Democracy Program has a good list of reforms, including curbside voting (for those with no permanent address) and a number of security measures like post-election audits. The Brennan Center for Justice has its own list, with considerable overlap. (Lake also emphasized same-day registration, a reform many states, including Utah, have used to boost turnout.

But most reformers agree that universal mail-in voting is the core of a safe and secure election system. It’s the simplest and most reliable way to ensure that everyone can participate, especially at a time when going to the polls could be dangerous. Democrats should insist on it.

Holding the line will require unusual spine from Democrats

As Axios documents, there are various voting reforms being contemplated in various states in response to the novel coronavirus — and many more states are likely to get in on the action. But the basic security of federal elections cannot be left entirely to state governments.

Republicans claim to oppose the Klobuchar/Wyden bill because of federalism. States are in charge of election law, they say; no “one size fits all” approach will work. But the bill, like the voting reform bill from House Democrats last month, doesn’t dictate specific procedures or staffing, it simply imposes a few baseline conditions that must be met for the election to count as free and fair. One is universal access to mail-in voting.

Regardless, Republicans are likely to fight federal voting reform with everything they have, if only because they instinctively fight everything Democrats want these days. And as usual, they will have a coordinated media machine behind them to attack and browbeat their opponents. They will accuse Democrats of trying to rig elections. They will accuse Democrats of “playing politics,” holding up needed stimulus for unrelated partisan reasons. They will spin the mainstream media into presenting the whole thing as a political squabble rather than a fight over basic voting rights.

All of that is as predictable as the sun rising.

The phase 3 stimulus fight did not offer much reason to hope that Democrats are willing to stand up to that kind of (by now, numbingly familiar) bullying. When they pushed back on the ludicrous corporate giveaway the Republican Senate put forward, conservatives immediately drove “Democrats delay recovery” headlines into the media and Democrats immediately started sweating. They let DC media get to them — and conservatives find it trivially easy to manipulate DC media. (Trump himself has literally mocked reporters for being such suckers for every “new tone.”)

This is an absolutely new message and new tone from Trump. https://t.co/bgVnEdKCK2 — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) March 31, 2020

Still, the stakes are too high this time. The more chaos and uncertainty there is as November approaches, the more opportunities there will be for cheating and the less the American public will trust election results.

If the country wants to conduct free and fair elections, it needs to start preparing now. Procedures need to be put in place; people need to be hired; the Postal Service needs to be bulked up. (The Center for Civic Design has a great tool kit for scaling up mail-in voting; the National Vote at Home Institute has detailed plan for taking mail-in voting national by November; the National Task Force on Election Crises has its own set of Covid-19 related suggestions, also featuring universal mail-in voting.)

Democrats need to prepare themselves for the fight of their lives. Any pro-social policy will be wrested from the hands of recalcitrant Republicans in the Senate through political force. It will be a fight, a game of chicken, not the collaborative bipartisan process of Democratic reveries. They will need a thick skin and uncharacteristic unity. But they have some power if they are willing to use it.

If Democrats don’t get a fair shot at competing in November — in a political system already so heavily tilted against democracy and against Democrats — all their dreams of action on climate change, health care, and immigration reform will come to nothing, and the country they were elected to serve could very well come apart at the seams.

They must hold the line on free and fair elections.

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

Share All sharing options for: I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

SEONGNAM, South Korea — On April 15, millions of people across South Korea donned face masks, rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer to cast their votes in a nationwide election.

Poll workers wore face protection, masks, and medical gloves. Upon arrival at the polling station, voters’ temperatures were taken, and anyone showing signs of fever was taken to a more secluded area of the building to cast their ballots. Separate polling stations were set up outside of hospitals for people infected with Covid-19 to vote.

The strict health and safety measures South Korea’s government put in place for election day could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the world — including the United States — on how to safely hold an election amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In-person voting is a risky prospect right now, as public health experts warn that having large numbers of people gather in small, enclosed areas like polling places is one of the surest ways to spread the extremely contagious coronavirus.

This scenario played out in Wisconsin last week, when Republican lawmakers and the state’s conservative-controlled Supreme Court rejected the Democratic governor’s attempts to postpone the state’s scheduled elections or change voting rules to allow people to vote by mail.

The result was a political and public health nightmare: Wisconsin voters were forced to either stay home and forfeit their votes or violate the state’s stay-at-home measures and risk their health to cast their votes in person at their local polling places. Thousands chose the latter option.

With little time to prepare, poll workers scrambled to do whatever they could to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Photos showed voters — many wearing masks, but some not — trying to maintain social distancing guidelines (remaining at least 6 feet apart) as best they could while standing in long lines waiting to vote, before being ushered into cramped schools, gyms, public libraries, and churches to cast their ballots.

The state’s public health officials have said it could be weeks before they know whether Wisconsin’s elections triggered a wider outbreak of the coronavirus, and some state party officials worry the chaos around the election has damaged its legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.

But as South Korea’s very different experience on Wednesday shows, things didn’t have to go that way.

South Korean voters had to go through extensive sanitization measures

As of election day, April 15, South Korea had nearly 10,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 220 deaths. The country saw its peak of Covid-19 cases on February 29, when it recorded more than 900 new cases. Now, a month and a half later, the number of new cases lingers at around 30 a day — one of the quickest turnarounds for any country struggling with the virus.

Experts credit the drastic drop in numbers to a proactive government that has pushed aggressive preventive measures and consistent testing. The government bet on these same methods to safely hold the first national election by a country during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Entering the polling station was an extensive process. My polling station in Pangyo, Seongnam, was a community center within my apartment complex. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10 am, which is when voters usually swarm to the polls.

As soon as I walked through the entrance, I had to stop at a “sanitizing station” where four officials stood armed with a thermometer that took my temperature when hovered above my forehead, several bottles of hand sanitizer, and boxes of disposable gloves.

Once they checked I had a mask on (I had brought one from home), they took my temperature to ensure that I showed no fever; those who had a temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) were escorted to a separate polling booth in a secluded area before being sent for virus testing. They then squeezed hand sanitizer into my palms and gave me gloves to cover my clean hands.

Officials had already marked the floors ahead of time with stickers spaced one meter (3.28 feet) apart to ensure that voters were safely distanced while standing in line. Most people adhered to the stickers, and when a few inched up to the people in front of them out of impatience, the head supervisor of the poll instantly shooed them back into place.

The only time I took off my mask was when an official compared my face with my photo ID, which was required in the South Korean elections, and the entire process only lasted about 10 seconds.

Once it was my turn, I walked into one of the four voting booths, lined up a few feet apart from the other voters, with two paper ballots in my hand. The stamp I used to mark my vote slipped a bit in my gloved hands, but the gloves were necessary since there weren’t sanitizer wipes available to wipe down any surfaces. The government said it would frequently sanitize polling stations, but the booth wasn’t disinfected before the next voter walked in after me.

Once I cast my ballot, I was ushered to a large pink trash bag taped to the wall, dedicated to the disposal of gloves. A poll worker pointed to the trash bag and then to my hands to indicate I needed to remove my gloves before leaving.

Despite the long line and multiple sanitization steps, I was in and out of the building in less than 10 minutes.

Separate polling booths were set up outside of hospitals for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, and those in more severe conditions mailed in their ballots.

The largest group the government had to address was the nearly 60,000 people in quarantine; 22.8 percent of these people — a total of 13,642 — applied to vote and were given the option to leave their houses at 5:20 pm to arrive at their polling stations by 6 pm, after the rest of the population finished voting.

They had an hour to cast their ballots and return to their homes by 7 pm. The BBC reported that they then had to call the government to announce their return home; failure to do so could lead to a visit from the police.

It’s an efficient system, but it’s not foolproof. There are still some risk factors that make experts like Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, wary.

Kim said it all depends on the cooperation of the quarantined people. If they fail to follow the rules, it could easily lead to another outbreak.

Related Democrats should make voting reform a nonnegotiable baseline for the next stimulus bill

“I’m concerned that some people might finish voting before 7 pm and use their remaining time to wander, such as going shopping or visiting coffee shops,” he said. “They may think they’re harmless because they don’t seem sick, but we already know that asymptomatic people can transfer the virus.”

Ultimately, the success of this election won’t be tested until two weeks from now, once the incubation period of the virus is over. But if there isn’t a major surge in cases by then, the US could learn a few lessons on how to successfully hold elections, especially as November inches closer.

Most people seemed to feel comfortable voting because of the government’s effective response to the pandemic

The masks, hand sanitizer, and plastic gloves may have been an odd sight, but in many ways, election day felt like any other election: Families arrived in groups at polling stations, some brought their pets, and neighbors greeted each other at the entrance.

Kim Yu-jin, 36, who wheeled her child in a stroller as she voted with her husband, said she was happy with the way the elections were held.

“The government was perfectly prepared,” she said. “As a country, we’ve already been doing a good job at social distancing, and individuals have been proactively using masks and hand sanitizer. Everyone’s been trying to be as cautious as possible, which helped boost the government’s efforts to ensure a safe election.”

Bu Kyeong-hee, 48, said opening the polls as planned was not only the best way to ensure a smooth election but also the most logical step for a country that is slowly easing back into normal life. She added that other countries could learn from the aggressive measures taken by both the government and individuals to prevent infections and maintain social distancing while proceeding with crucial democratic events.

Hwang Sung-ha, 37, also thought it was appropriate for the government to push forward with the election because people could have a direct say in picking officials who would rebuild the country ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Not everyone agrees, though: While Lee Kyeong-sook, 67, also said she was impressed by how the government handled the election, she said she had initially hoped for the government to postpone the event.

“My friends and I all agreed that we wished the government had delayed the election,” she said. “They’ve already been asking people my age to stay inside, so I wonder why they pushed for us to show up at the polls today.”

But ultimately, Lee — who cast her ballot along with more than 29 million others around the country — said she did so because it’s her duty as a citizen. Voting is a right that Koreans obtained only in 1948, which is why she considers it so important to voice her opinion through elections.

“We need to come together for the best of our country — especially during times like this,” she said.

https://www.vox.com/,"One of the most striking elements of the coronavirus crisis is how easily the response has been folded into America’s partisan culture war. From the earliest days of the outbreak, Republicans in Congress, party-aligned media, and voters have tended to play down the pandemic and treat the push for social distancing skeptically — while also positing nefarious motives for liberals and public officials who take opposite positions. There are exceptions, like Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, but corona-skepticism and hyper-partisanship has been more much the rule.

The Trump administration was infamously slow to embrace distancing and conduct widespread testing; even now, President Donald Trump is privately pushing to rapidly reopen the country starting May 1. Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, who didn’t declare a state of emergency until April 2, recently declared WWE wresting an “essential service” that can continue to broadcast live shows. Conservative media has cast Democratic governors who have imposed distancing as authoritarians, pitting allegedly authentic Americans who want to reopen the country against out-of-touch liberal elites who don’t care about the lockdown’s economic consequences.

It is, of course, desperately important to establish a sense of shared reality and responsibility here. You need a cross-elite consensus on coronavirus, not only to swiftly pass essential legislation like more expansive forms of stimulus, but also to make sure the entire citizenry actually follows public health best practices in their daily lives. The more Republicans and allied media treat the coronavirus as a partisan issue, the harder those things will become.

How did the coronavirus become folded into the culture war in such a harmful way? One of the best explanations I’ve seen comes from David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College. The GOP, Hopkins writes on his personal blog, is failing on coronavirus not by accident — but because the party was built in a way that produced failure.

“The contemporary Republican Party has been built to wage ideological and partisan conflict more than to manage the government or solve specific social problems,” Hopkins writes. “So perhaps it shouldn’t be shocking that an array of subjects, from what medical treatment might help COVID patients to how important it is to take measures protecting the lives of the elderly, have been drawn into the perpetual political wars.”

This analysis draws on Hopkins’s book Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats, coauthored with Michigan State’s Matt Grossmann. In the book, Hopkins and Grossman argue that there’s a fundamental structural difference between the Democratic and Republican parties: While the former is a coalition of social groups, the latter is primarily a vehicle for a single cohesive ideological movement.

This difference makes it much easier for conservative Republicans to push the party to the fringes on the right than it does for leftist Democrats to do the same. But it also means that the GOP is less able to shift its policy approach to adapt to specific policy problems: It is so consumed by ideology, so preoccupied with the war on Democrats and liberals, that it cannot countenance cooperating with them to address a shared national problem. The Republican party needs a perpetual liberal enemy.

In other countries — Canada, for example — the coronavirus has created unprecedented levels of cross-party cooperation and consensus, as everyone recognizes that it’s in the common national interest to fight the virus through mass measures like social distancing.

In the United States, by contrast, even positions on basic medical issues, like whether hydroxychloroquine should be promoted as an effective therapy for the virus, are becoming partisan-signaling fights. Conservative media in the US is touting a more relaxed “Swedish response” to the crisis — despite Sweden’s lack of restrictions producing far higher death tolls than those of its neighbors — and arguing that liberals are exploiting the restrictions to impose their agenda on the country.

Sometimes, the impulse to polarize everything works well for Republicans in crass political terms. It helped Trump escape impeachment despite clear evidence of his guilt. But Hopkins thinks it might not work out so well this time around:

Republicans need a party-wide reset of priorities. There has seldom been a time in recent political history when daily partisan point-scoring has been rendered more irrelevant. The general election is far enough away that good policy is good politics: the best way for the ruling party to serve its own electoral interests is to work as hard as possible over the next seven months to render COVID manageable and prevent economic freefall. The widespread public confidence that will be necessary for “normal life” to resume simply can’t be jawboned back into existence via daily press conferences, radio broadcasts, or Fox News monologues. If Republicans lose the battle with the coronavirus, they won’t have much of a chance to win the fight against liberalism.

Owning the libs is the raison d’être of the current Republican party. It’s not a governing strategy in normal times. But in a crisis, it’s downright catastrophic — and quite possibly self-defeating.

https://www.vox.com/,"On March 24, 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, to not much fanfare, predicted that unemployment in the United States was about to skyrocket to a point higher than that reached at the peak of the Great Depression: 32 percent.

That is an astonishing — even incomprehensible — figure. Just four weeks ago, before the coronavirus pandemic plunged us into a recession, unemployment was at 3.5 percent. During the depths of the Great Recession, the highest unemployment reached was 10 percent. Nearly a century ago, in the Great Depression, the worst figure was 24.9 percent — lower if you count people in work relief jobs as employed.

The so-called back-of-the-envelope calculation by the St. Louis Fed is simply staggering. If anywhere close to accurate, it suggests Americans have barely come to grips with the coming economic calamity.

To be clear, the 32.1 percent figure is almost certainly wrong when it comes to the precise number. Other economists argue it’s much too high. Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Chicago Fed, tells me it is “based on extreme assumptions” that everyone at risk of layoffs gets laid off. But there are strong reasons to believe Americans are in for unemployment levels higher than any seen in most of their lifetimes.

Reaching that number is not inevitable. We can do much to arrest it. But it is going to take serious and sustained work from policymakers, who still might not grasp just how big the economic catastrophe is.

How the St. Louis Fed arrived at its estimate

Bank economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro wrote a blog post laying out the logic behind the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate.

First, he cited research by his St. Louis Fed colleague Charles Gascon, who classified 808 occupations tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics by how likely they are to face layoffs due to social distancing rules. Gascon’s estimate was that 66.8 million people in sales, production, food preparation, and other sectors were at high risk of layoffs.

Three other economists at the St. Louis Fed — Fernando Leibovici, Ana Maria Santacreu, and Matthew Famiglietti — relied on survey data asking Americans how close, physically, they work to other people to classify occupations. They estimated that 27.3 million workers are in occupations with “high contact intensity.”

So Faria-e-Castro simply averaged these two estimates — 66.8 million people, and 27.3 million people — together to estimate the likely number of unemployed people during coronavirus lockdown. They average to 47.05 million.

Now, there were 5.76 million unemployed people in February 2020, before social distancing began en masse; and the US civilian labor force had 164.5 million people in it in February. Add up the unemployed numbers and divided by 164.5 million, and you get 32.1 percent.

This is a very, very rough estimate, to a level where calling it “back of the envelope” feels like an insult to envelope math. Faria-e-Castro writes that the real number could be as low as 10.5 percent (if you take the estimate of “high contact” occupations and exclude education and health care workers who are less likely to be laid off) and 40.6 percent (if you use the “high risk of layoff” number only). There’s a whole universe of potential outcomes in that range.

But Faria-e-Castro’s estimate is worth taking seriously, even if it winds up being much too high.

Reasons to think extremely high unemployment is plausible

Let’s start with one very solid number: 3.283 million.

That’s how many people filed new initial unemployment claims the week ending March 21. It was likely an undercount of the total number of layoffs occurring that week, given how backed up the phone and online systems for accessing unemployment insurance have been.

Due both to those deferred claims and to the increasing number of employers shutting down the following week, claims for the week ending March 28 may be higher. Yale economist Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham and University of Minnesota economist Aaron Sojourner estimate that there will be 5.6 million new claims. Preliminary news reports suggest the number could be even higher, even double the 3.3 million number from the prior week.

Rutgers economist William Rodgers III (a former chief economist at the Department of Labor) and the Century Foundation’s Andrew Stettner built a model using these kinds of unemployment claims numbers to predict the unemployment rate. Plugging in the most recent claims data, they estimate a true unemployment rate in March of 17 percent. In some states, they find the unemployed share is far greater than that: 44.9 percent in Louisiana, 44.6 percent in New Hampshire, 34.6 percent in Pennsylvania.

That 17 percent figure might be too high, Faberman of the Chicago Fed says, because it doesn’t account for the fact that the “take-up rate” of unemployment insurance claims rises during downturns. That means there are fewer unemployed people not getting unemployment relief who you have to add to the unemployment rate estimate, meaning the unemployment number could be an overestimate.

But he concedes 17 to 20 percent might be a good estimate of where the job market is headed, if not in March, then in a couple of months. Even now additional businesses are closing down as stay-at-home orders spread to new cities and states, suggesting we could be in for several weeks of high claims numbers.

Other ways of estimating how many people will ultimately be laid off suggest a much higher upper bound.

UChicago economists Jonathan Dingel and Brent Neiman recently put out a paper titled simply, “How Many Jobs Can be Done at Home?” Their answer, from evaluating survey responses to questions about how often workers need to work outdoors or use heavy machinery/vehicles, is that about 34 percent of jobs can be done from home. If you add the 12 percent of jobs that are part of the health care industry to that total (which is an overestimate, since at least some health care jobs can be done from home), you get 46 percent.

That makes 54 percent of all jobs not performable from home, or not part of the health care sector and thus more resistant to layoffs due to massive demand. This is higher, Dingel and Neiman are quick to point out, than other estimates of work from home. Princeton’s Alexandre Mas and Harvard’s Amanda Pallais, for instance, reported in 2019 that only 26 percent of Americans regularly worked from home; most of them were not in formal work-from-home arrangements, and very few were working exclusively from home.

54 percent unemployment is likely an extreme overestimate. Not every person who can’t work from home will be laid off. Some employers will keep them on payroll, perhaps using forgivable loans authorized as part of the congressional stimulus package. There are essential jobs other than health care that will keep people employed and not working from home during the pandemic, especially in grocery stores and takeout restaurants.

But 54 percent is nonetheless an upper bound. This shocks a lot of people I know, many of whom have jobs they can do from home. As a journalist I fall in that boat; I actually worked from home two to three days a week before the pandemic hit. My life hasn’t changed that much. But I have a very, very unusual job. Most work in the US cannot be performed from home, and it is reasonable to be worried that the vast majority of employers in such cases will not keep people on their payrolls.

Reasons for caution

There are, of course, other factors that could make unemployment in the 30 to 50 percent range less likely. The first and most obvious is the availability of government stimulus measures. Here, $1,200 checks are likely to be less important than the business loan provisions of the stimulus package, which enable businesses to take out large loans to cover their payroll on the understanding that the government will forgive the vast majority of these loans when the crisis is over.

Another factor, which Miguel Faria-e-Castro of the St. Louis Fed notes, is that the size of the labor force is not constant. During the last recession many people stopped looking for work and were not counted as unemployed for the purpose of the unemployment numbers put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We should expect some of that to happen again this time.

Ultimately we just won’t have much clarity on the unemployment rate until we see numbers for April. The unemployment rate for March will include data both from early in the month, before mass layoffs began, and later in the month. It’s not going to be a useful number. April, however, will be the cruelest month, capturing the bulk of the layoffs and furloughs undertaken due to coronavirus. The April numbers will not be available until the first week of May, and even those numbers will likely be significantly revised in subsequent months.

But you should not be shocked if the April number is in the double digits, at the very least. This is not inevitable, but it is quite plausible. These are truly unprecedented times. Expect unprecedented numbers.

https://www.vox.com/,"In the early morning hours of Wednesday, March 25, negotiators in the Senate landed on a $2.2 trillion deal to rescue the economy as it falls into recession (with 3.3 million new jobless claims in one week) amid the coronavirus pandemic. In an almost unheard-of display of unity on a major bill, the measure passed 96-0.

It’s a flawed package, but overall a shockingly ambitious measure from a Republican legislature — and one that can and should be made stronger in the coming weeks as the country sinks deeper into recession.

To think through this stimulus, it helps to think back to the last economic crisis and the stimulus we got then.

In late 2008, as the US was spiraling further into its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Christina Romer, the UC Berkeley economist whom President-elect Barack Obama had selected as his chief economist, prepared a memo of stimulus options for Obama to review.

To fully repair the economy by the first quarter of 2011, she estimated, would require a “combination of spending, taxes and transfers to states and localities … costing about $1.8 trillion over two years.”

The memo did not make it to Obama. According to Noam Scheiber’s book The Escape Artists, when Romer showed her estimate to fellow Obama adviser Larry Summers, he dismissed the number as too high. She then prepared a memo where the most expensive option was $1.2 trillion. Summers still thought it too high, telling her, per Scheiber, “$1.2 trillion is nonplanetary.” That was his way of saying “ridiculous” or “out of this world.” Congress eventually passed, and Obama signed, a $787 billion package.

Summers wanted the $1.8 trillion in stimulus as much as Romer did — he just thought Congress would reject it as a joke, and prevent the Obama administration from getting anything. This was his calculation when Democrats were set to have 59 out of 100 Senate seats and a massive House majority.

Fast-forward nearly 12 years. The Senate has just passed (and the House is poised to follow suit) a stimulus package costing a whopping $2.2 trillion. And the spending is set to occur within a single year, not spread over two as Romer envisioned in 2008.

So given that background, how should we think about the stimulus emerging from Congress? If it’s compared to the most ambitious stimulus and recovery packages proposed in the runup to its passage, or to the most ambitious ones passed elsewhere in the world, then it leaves a lot to be desired.

Its cash checks are a one-off, with no automatic payments to kick in if and when unemployment spikes. The increase in unemployment benefits is similarly temporary and not tied to objective economic metrics that could keep them from being withdrawn early. The benefits to businesses are opaque and might be inferior to just having the government temporarily take over payroll for struggling companies, the way Denmark has done as its crisis response. There’s too little aid to state and local governments to forestall budget cuts, and no mandate for postal voting in the 2020 election to be sure it’s conducted safely if the country is still under quarantine.

But how does the bill stack up to the last stimulus? It’s definitely an improvement. Even granting that the coronavirus recession is likely to be deeper than the 2008-’09 downturn, the huge increase in scale is an incredibly promising development.

Something about this crisis turned nonplanetary ideas into planetary ones. There are some decades where nothing happens, and some weeks where decades happen. We are living through many such weeks right now, right in a row, and the result is a political environment that would have been unrecognizable mere months ago.

The important thing is that Congress has taken advantage of this rapid ideological movement and passed this bill. Now it needs to pass more like it in the weeks and months to come.

What the stimulus package gets right

The key question that Romer faced in putting together a stimulus package in 2008 was how big the “output gap” was: How much economic activity could exist if the economy were firing on all cylinders but didn’t because of the recession?

That’s one of the major questions macroeconomists have to answer, because it responds directly to recessions like the one that hit in 2008. That recession, like many, was essentially a crisis of expectations. There were just as many workers, just as many factories, just as many retail storefronts, etc. in 2008 as there had been a year earlier, when unemployment was low and the economy was growing.

The “real resources” of the economy hadn’t diminished at all. But the amount of work being done by those workers, factories, stores, etc. suddenly dropped dramatically. It became a vicious self-perpetuating cycle. Businesses didn’t want to hire or invest because they were worried they wouldn’t have enough customers. Customers were nervous to spend because times were so tight, and because so many were unemployed.

The key to the 2008-’09 stimulus was to generate a surge of spending (“demand” in econ parlance) that would enable businesses to start hiring and investing again, so that the economy could return to where it was just a couple of years previous.

The 2020 recession is not like that. The real resources of the economy have diminished, dramatically. Many workers, like bartenders or cooks or waitstaff or retail personnel, are physically barred from working. Physical locations — factories, stores, etc. — that were productive in January are not being staffed in March by government fiat. Workers who can work from home are, but many others can’t because their work isn’t suitable for telecommuting.

In that situation, the near-term goal is not to stimulate economic activity per se. It’s to ensure that absolutely essential real resources — like food, shelter, and medical care — are being adequately provided, and that households have the resources they need to pay for those necessities.

The ”phase three” (following phases one and two) stimulus package that the Senate passed Wednesday night doesn’t do as much as I’d like toward reaching that goal. But it does an awful lot, and frankly more than I ever expected a Republican president and Senate would accept.

The @BudgetHawks have THE summary of the $2.2 trillion just-passed CARES Act. Read it. Use it. Retweet it. Ask Questions. https://t.co/EfPR0PVvPh pic.twitter.com/R68bN79WPD — Marc Goldwein (@MarcGoldwein) March 26, 2020

The most headline-grabbing thing it does is offer $1,200 per adult and $500 per child dependent to most households as a blank check, phasing out at high incomes (above $75,000 for singles and $150,000 for married couples). That’s an immediate influx of money that can pay bills for low-income people, including people with no incomes. I’ve covered cash policy for a long time, and the mere fact that a Republican Congress accepted payments to Americans with no taxable income, the poorest of the poor, is remarkable to me.

More important, though, is the UI section: four months of unemployment insurance of at least $600 per week to everyone put out of work due to coronavirus. That means UI that actually exceeds the wages of people paid $15 an hour or less. Plus, the benefit is available to part-time and contract workers. This is a cash stimulus measure, too, but one limited to people directly disemployed by this crisis. It’s a sensible way to target assistance to the hardest-hit and make sure they can afford food and shelter. The provision is so generous that four GOP senators — Tim Scott (SC), Rick Scott (FL), Ben Sasse (NE), and Lindsey Graham (SC) — objected on the grounds that it’s too generous, threatening to derail the bill. (In the end, all four voted for the bill.)

The most expensive parts of the bill are its sections “bailing out” various businesses by offering $366 billion in loans to small businesses and $504 billion in loans to larger businesses, states, and local governments. It’s hard to know what these programs will do without seeing them implemented. But in the event that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin enforces the provisions barring layoffs for companies benefiting, this could serve as an adjunct to the UI expansion, enabling businesses to avoid payroll reductions and providing more money, overall, to workers than the government will directly.

Finally there’s the question of paying for health care. The bill offers $100 billion to hospitals and $150 billion in emergency aid to state and local governments, the latter premised on being used for coronavirus (indicating it will be used for, say, Medicaid before paying teacher salaries). I don’t know if this will be enough to cover uncompensated care for the uninsured during this crisis, or if this is the best way to structure such aid. But it’s a significant investment.

How the stimulus package could be improved

Overall, the scale and generosity of the package is far above what I expected from a Senate led by Mitch McConnell, who tried his hardest to sink the much smaller stimulus of around $800 billion that Obama wound up proposing in early 2009.

But it could still be improved, and instead of recessing, the Senate should be working on ways to improve it.

The biggest problem is that the package is too short-term. The UI provisions expire in four months. The loans are a one-off package. The state and local aid doesn’t re-up despite states like Ohio saying they’re facing budget cuts of 20 percent. The cash checks only go out once, and not as quickly as they could (ideally through EBT cards, or Social Security checks to existing recipients, for people who didn’t file 2019 or 2018 taxes because they lacked sufficient income). Indeed, some tax filers with no direct deposit information could be waiting months for their checks.

A logical fix to the package is to apply a Sahm rule to it all. Named after Claudia Sahm, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who has established herself as one of the most essential voices on coronavirus response, a Sahm rule is a policy where stimulus measures are executed automatically on the basis of objective economic data, not congressional discretion. As my colleague Matt Yglesias explains, the Sahm rule reflects the fact that “historically, when the unemployment rate over the past three months rises at least 0.5 percentage points above the average over the past 12 months, a recession is imminent.” You can see this in action in the data here.

Sahm’s original idea was that the government should just send out checks to every American when this indicator kicks in. We’re past that point in the coronavirus crisis: We know we need these benefits to kick in. What we need instead is to adapt Sahm’s idea so that we extend all or most of the benefits in the congressional stimulus package until the economy is recovered.

Here’s one way to do a Sahm rule: We keep sending out $2,000 checks, financed by the Federal Reserve, for each adult and child (inspired by California Rep. Maxine Waters’s plan) every month until the employment to population ratio for working-age people reaches 80.5 percent again, its level when this crisis started. Once it hits that level, the checks can start phasing out with each 0.1 point increase in the ratio.

You could do the same with aid to state and local governments. Start by offering 50 percent of their 2019 state revenue as a federal grant, taking advantage of the ultra-low interest rates the federal government currently enjoys. Phase down the grant amounts as we approach full employment again. Make the process automatic, reflecting actual economic data, not Congress’s whims. And, while you’re at it, push the Fed to buy state and local debt.

Unemployment insurance is a little different. Paying more than 100 percent of lost wages for low-income workers makes a lot of sense right now when we’re trying to keep people out of unnecessary work for public health reasons. But it may deter people from reentering the job market once the public health emergency is over. So in the medium-run, an automatic, Sahm rule UI program would be pegged to, say, 100 percent of wages up to a certain limit, rather than a flat $600 amount, until employment is back to normal, so there’s still an economic benefit to jumping back into the labor force.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) has a bill already that would work a bit like this. It would also push states to set up “short-term compensation” or work-sharing programs, which allow companies to use UI funds to keep workers on payroll. That way people can stay attached to their work through this crisis while still getting paid.

We don’t need to pass all these measures immediately. But Congress should pass them this spring so we have automatic policies in place going into the election season, and into the what could be the worst of the pandemic this summer. We cannot rely on legislators to always mobilize aggressively. We need automatic policies that get support to people whether Congress gets its act together or not. And paradoxically, the only way to do that is to have Congress pass automatic stabilizer legislation, and to pass it soon. Just because a $2.2 trillion bill has been passed doesn’t mean Congress’s work is done.

https://www.vox.com/,"Early Monday morning before financial markets opened, the Federal Reserve announced a dramatic series of moves designed to promote economic stability as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter the US economy, sending unemployment claims skyrocketing and pushing the economy into recession.

The spirit of today’s announcement is basically: pull all the levers.

The Fed’s moves are dramatic, somewhat complicated, and unprecedented, but they have a pretty simple purpose — try to make it cheap for all kinds of entities to get loans while hoping public health officials can get the virus under control and Congress can act to provide the kinds of economic support that only it can offer.

But for all that the Fed is doing — an alphabet soup of new, revived, and expanded programs involving eye-popping sums of money — it’s also noteworthy that monetary policymakers aren’t doing anything to deviate from the same basic inflation targeting paradigm they’ve used for decades now. It will help reassure the world that nothing too wild is going on here, hopefully bolstering the political legitimacy of dramatic new steps. But it also likely blunts the real-world impact of these measures. In this case, going even further to include financial support to state and local governments, or announcing that the central bank is moving beyond its longtime emphasis on inflation targeting could be even better.

It starts with unlimited QE

For a long time, the Federal Reserve’s approach to stabilizing the economy was largely limited to setting short-term interest rates. During the Great Recession, short-term rates went to zero and the economy was still depressed. That led the Fed to undertake multiple rounds of what’s somewhat confusingly come to be known as “quantitative easing,” which basically means the Fed announces it’s going to buy such-and-such billion dollars’ worth of longer-term bonds and then goes out and does that.

Interest rates were already low at the start of the coronavirus crisis, so the Fed cut rates on March 3 and then cut rates again, all the way down to zero on March 15. Then it rapidly announced a plan for $700 billion in quantitative easing — $500 billion worth of US government bonds and $200 billion worth of bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (these are called “agency-backed securities” in Fed-speak).

Monday’s announcement expanded the QE program in two ways. First, it uncapped the quantity of quantitative easing, saying simply that the Fed “will purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” Second, it is expanding the scope of what can be purchased to include commercial real estate (things like offices and stores) backed by Fannie and Freddie to ensure low interest rates throughout the sector.

But wait, there’s more!

A bunch of new programs

In traditional monetary policy, short-term interest rates are the lever that moves the whole economy. Rates on long-term government bonds go down when short-term rates go down, and rates on corporate debt go down when rates on government debt go down. So even though the short-term rates are not themselves particularly important, the workings of profit-seeking traders ensure that the impact propagates throughout the economy.

QE exists as an alternative means of impacting long-term rates without trying to make short-term rates go below zero (which runs the risk that people will resort to storing physical cash in vaults rather than suffering negative rates). But the Fed is also worried that there is so much fear in financial markets that the economic impact won’t propagate naturally. So they are launching a huge alphabet soup of credit facilities.

The Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) will buy newly issued corporate bonds, typically from large employers.

The Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will buy existing corporate bonds to give people confidence that this remains a “liquid” market and thus they don’t need to panic-sell corporate debt they already own, or fear buying new debt from credit-worthy companies.

The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility will buy asset-backed securities (basically packages of loans) composed of student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, and other forms of consumer debt plus some Small Business Administration loans.

The Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility will expand the range of things it buys to include a kind of municipal bond called a “municipal variable rate demand note” as well as bank certificates of deposit, which are basically medium-term loans consumers make to retail banks.

The Commercial Paper Funding Facility is going to expand to include “high-quality, tax-exempt commercial paper,” which is a kind of business debt that allows state and local governments to create tax subsidies for businesses.

All this is happening today.

Meanwhile, the Fed is not quite ready to explain the details or launch, but it also previewed that it expects “to announce soon the establishment of a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to eligible small- and medium-sized businesses, complementing efforts by the SBA,” or Small Business Administration.

It’s not entirely clear what that will look like. But it exemplifies the spirit of Monday’s announcement, which is basically, pull all the levers. Traditional logic would say that actions in the corporate bond market (which is tapped by bigger businesses) should trickle down to small businesses and consumer credit. But today’s Fed isn’t taking chances with either the economic impact or the impact on political legitimacy. All kinds of loans — federal government debt, consumer debt, corporate debt, mortgage debt, commercial real estate debt, and small business debt — are going to get help.

But there’s one big exception: state and local governments.

A glaring missing piece

The Federal Reserve has been clear for weeks that it cannot tackle the problems facing the economy alone and it wants support from fiscal policy — stimulus measures enacted by the United States Congress.

But Congress is not the only government actor in the US. States and localities have tremendous leverage and they actually do much more direct employment than the federal government. Cops, firefighters, teachers, and librarians are primarily employed by local governments, and construction projects on roads and other infrastructure are largely financed through state government.

As Skanda Amarnath, the director of research and analysis at Employ America and a former New York Fed research analyst, points out, the glaring exception to the Fed’s new aggressiveness is it is doing very little on state and local debt even though it has the legal authority to help here.

Good that the Fed is thinking creatively to support the corporate credit market. The newer facilities have some real teeth potentially.



Bad that the Fed is pretty much hanging state and local governments out to dry here and not providing the same support to the broader muni mkt — Skanda Amarnath ( Neoliberal Sellout ) (@IrvingSwisher) March 23, 2020

Michael Madowitz, an economist with the Center for American Progress, tweets that “after all the complaining about fiscal policy, the Fed is not doing enough to prevent austerity as it’s happening.”

Progressives have long called for the Federal Reserve to expand its toolkit to include more support for state and local government. During the Great Recession, balanced budget rules forced massive cuts in state/local spending (plus some tax increases in the more progressive states), which generally meant that in the aggregate, the public sector was removing support from the economy despite the big federal stimulus bill. More support for states and localities was a key plank of a December 2017 report on the Fed from the Roosevelt Institute. Amarnath teamed up with Yakov Feygin of the Berggruen Institute on March 15 to lay out a specific plan for how they could do that within their existing statutory authority — citing powers under Section 14(2)(b) of the Federal Reserve Act.

So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his team have opted not to do that, largely limiting themselves to powers that exist in Section 13(3) and allow the Fed to support private sector activity. Another limitation to Section 13(3) powers is the way they are written; the Fed can only act in tandem with the Treasury Department. So today’s measures are being backed by the money that’s in the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which means there are limits to how much the Fed can actually do without further congressional action. Section 14(2)(b) powers to buy state and local debt could be undertaken immediately and without limitation.

But perhaps the biggest limit on today’s Fed actions is they take place within the context of the same overall framework for monetary policy.

New tools, same rulebook

The Federal Reserve practices what’s known as inflation targeting, meaning it tries to make measured prices rise by about 2 percent per year. That’s often seemed in practice like an inflation ceiling — they try to make measures prices rise by close to but no more than 2 percent per year.

This does not allow for any “catch-up” inflation, where you say that if a deeply depressed economy had extremely slow price growth for a while then you can make up for it by running things hot for longer than you otherwise would. Allowing for catch-up, called level targeting among monetary policy nerds, could bolster the impact of emergency measures by assuring people that the safety net won’t be withdrawn at the first possible opportunity.

Another target switch, advocated by former Obama administration economist Christina Romer, and explained most comprehensively and forcefully by the Mercatus Center’s David Beckworth, would be to forget about inflation altogether and target nominal spending instead.

That would mean saying that a hit to the economy could be taken in the form of increased inflation rather than reduced output. The way the current framework works, for example, if increased demand for soap, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and bleach spray leads to higher prices, that becomes a reason for monetary policy to do less to support the economy. Similarly, if switching from in-restaurant service to less efficient home delivery raises prices, that’s inflation which the Fed is supposed to fight. In the current phase of the economic situation, this doesn’t make a difference in practice, because the tumbling price of oil and other basic commodities swamps everything else.

There will presumably be a time when some restrictions are lifted but there is not yet a Covid-19 vaccine, and the economy is growing but has not yet bounced back to where it was. At that point, prices will start increasing even though total income and spending levels will be lower than they were before the virus hit. Inflation targeting says that’s the top to start doing less monetary stimulus to support the economy, while a nominal spending target says to push through even if some stuff gets expensive.

On the one hand, this is sort of a problem for another time given the intensity of the current crisis. But on the other hand, both financial markets and on-the-ground investors are at least somewhat forward-looking, so the Fed’s guidance for what it is likely to do in the future matters. And despite the radicalism of today’s crisis steps, conservatism about the overall framework of monetary policy continues to limit their potency.",1
https://www.vox.com/,"Ben Bernanke's new memoir, The Courage to Act, is a fantastic and reasonably accessible introduction to the economic thought of a former Federal Reserve Chair who was a leading academic economist before serving in government. But it doesn't really make news or offer gossipy new scoops about the financial crisis and other major newsworthy events that Bernanke was involved with.

It does, however, feature a brief — but very intriguing — discussion of a proposal the Federal Reserve discussed in 2011. It's an idea called ""NGDP targeting,"" which a libertarian economist named Scott Sumner has popularized on the internet and which has won the allegiance of everyone from former Obama adviser Christina Romer and liberal economist Paul Krugman to the Economist and conservative pundit Ramesh Ponnuru. Michael Woodford, a Columbia University professor who's the author of the leading graduate-level textbook on monetary economics, is also a fan.

We already knew that Bernanke and his colleagues considered the idea and rejected it. But the book adds some interesting context — some from its account of the meeting, some from Bernanke's reflections on an old paper he wrote about Japan — for understanding that rejection. Bernanke, it seems, thought this proposed means of boosting the economy was unworkable. Not for any of the kinds of technical reasons that someone like Woodford would care about, but for essentially political reasons.

Bernanke didn't doubt that the Fed could, in theory, do more to address the then-acute problem of mass unemployment. The problem, in his view, was that the public — and, more importantly, Congress — would be angered by further action in a way that would be a problem for the Fed as an institution and would undermine the efficacy of the initiative anyway. Reading between the lines, Bernanke seems to believe that a better monetary policy regime is possible, but only with support from elected officials.

What is NGDP targeting?

To grasp the significance of what Bernanke says about NGDP targeting, all you really need to know is that it's an unconventional strategy that many distinguished outside observers believe the Federal Reserve could have used to reduce unemployment more rapidly.

In his book, Bernanke agrees that NGDP targeting would work in theory and describes the practical problems with doing it as essentially political in nature. He doesn't raise any technical objections, so the full technical details aren't crucially important to understanding this part of the book. But if you're interested, the best way to understand NGDP targeting is in contrast with inflation targeting.

Right now the Federal Reserve, like most other major central banks, defines its mission in terms of an inflation target — it aims for a long-term trend of 2 percent growth in the personal consumption expenditures deflator.

The NGDP targeting proposal is that the Fed should instead target a growth rate (usually conceived of as 4 or 5 percent) in the level of total economic output before adjusting for inflation. You can think of NGDP as the total level of spending in the economy. Equivalently, it's the total level of income earned in the economy. The idea is that if the central bank prints more money, nominal spending will go up. If it prints less money, nominal spending will go down. By stabilizing the growth rate of nominal spending, the central bank couldn't prevent all bad things from happening. But it could ensure that ""bad times"" means a temporary increase in the inflation rate rather than the kind of huge surges in unemployment associated with today's recessions.

There are a variety of theoretical arguments for NGDP targeting over inflation targeting, but it's gained steam as a policy proposal in the wake of the Great Recession for an essentially practical reason. Central banks' current practice of fighting inflation with higher interest rates and fighting recessions with lower interest rates has run aground recently on the fact that interest rates can only go so low. Banks have cut rates all the way down to zero and have still seen their economies experience slow job growth and weak inflation. NGDP targeting does away with that lower bound problem, and that's why it's moved off academic bookshelves and into policy discussions.

What's Ben Bernanke's case against NGDP targeting?

Much of Bernanke's pre-Fed writing and academic work can be understood as broadly sympathetic to the NGDP targeting proposal, though he doesn't really address it explicitly. In his memoir, he for the first time lays out his full thinking. I have added some helpful margin notes:

This discussion is notable both for its brevity and for what it doesn't say — he doesn't really take issue with the analysis of Sumner, Romer, Woodford, or anyone else who thinks NGDP targeting is, in principle, a superior framework. He just raises practical objections, based on his experience actually running the Fed.

The recurrence of Congress as a theme, and Bernanke's doubt that NGDP targeting would even be ""feasible"" whatever the ""theoretical benefits,"" is telling. Bernanke is saying that he thought an attempt to switch to NGDP targeting would lead to a political backlash and that his preference for avoiding this backlash isn't just a question of cowardice — it would be pointless to even try to announce the change, because the scale of the backlash would render it non-credible.

Bernanke's argument isn't entirely convincing

Of course, it's difficult to know. NGDP targeting is hard to explain to the mass public. But then again, it's not like inflation targeting is particularly well-understood. In some respects, NGDP is a much easier concept to grasp — the government simply counts every dollar spent (or every dollar earned) and then adds it all up. Inflation raises a lot of deep conceptual issues, like whether to use a chained or unchained price index, how to measure quality improvements, how to handle innovative new products, how to calculate the price of housing in a country where most people live in owner-occupied homes, and what to say about highly unstable fluctuations in global commodity prices.

It's even possible that the politics would work the other way. The Fed's current goal of 2 percent inflation implies that sometimes — often during a severe recession — the Fed has to take action to raise prices, which is going to sound like a terrible idea to most ordinary voters. On the other hand, if the Fed says it's taking action to raise incomes, that might make intuitive sense to the public.

But Bernanke's broader point about Congress seems true.

At the time, the Fed was already facing a large and growing chorus of criticism, largely from the right, for its efforts to stabilize the economy. Under the circumstances, defending the status quo was politically easier than defending an unfamiliar new change would have been.

But Bernanke's broadest point of all — that he didn't just shy away from a fight, but that doing otherwise would have been futile — seems at least debatable. The title of his book, after all, is The Courage to Act, and the entire point of having the Fed be an operationally independent central bank is that its leadership can be at least somewhat indifferent to congressional criticism. Bernanke has a reputation for politeness, and his book is exceptionally polite to most of his critics and adversaries. He's clearly not the kind of person who would have been well-suited to conduct a giant fight with hard money advocates in Congress. But it's at least possible that someone else could have waged such a fight successfully and done the country a lot of good.

Stronger political leadership could have made a difference

Back in 1999, Bernanke criticized the Bank of Japan's unwillingness to act more robustly to bolster the Japanese economy. He said the BOJ's leadership needed to show ""Rooseveltian resolve"" and model itself on the kind of boldness seen in 1933 in the United States, when FDR and the Federal Reserve broke the dollar's link to gold and successfully reflated the economy.

In the book, Bernanke revisits that criticism. He stands by the substance but says he regrets the ""sometimes harsh"" tone he took.

""Years later,"" he writes, ""having endured withering, motive-impugning criticism from politicians, editorial pages, and even fellow economists I found myself wishing I had dialed back my earlier rhetoric.""

Yet despite the apologies, Bernanke observes that ""the Bank of Japan would adopt my suggestions some fourteen years later.""

What he doesn't say is that this came about not because white papers from American academic macroeconomists suddenly became more persuasive. It came about because Japan finally got its Franklin Roosevelt, in the form of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — a politician and elected official able to win a mandate for change. By the same token, most observers agree that Ronald Reagan's backing of Paul Volcker was important to letting Volcker's sometimes-controversial strategy for fighting inflation work.

Reading between the lines, one can see the implication that Bernanke believes the Fed could have done more to boost the economy had there been more political support for additional action. But while the Fed faced significant political pressure from congressional Republicans to do less to bolster the economy, neither Barack Obama nor congressional Democrats were very interested in offering pressure from the other side. Before serving as Fed chair, Bernanke thought that central bankers alone could and should demonstrate ""Rooseveltian resolve."" After doing the job, he seems to have adopted a more complicated view of the politics of central banking and now thinks leadership from elected officials is required — leadership that did not exist during his tenure but that new activist groups like Fed Up are trying to create.",1

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"The economy is in free fall.

About 22 million people — or more than 13 percent of the US labor force — have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks. Economists are projecting unemployment as high as 20 percent within a matter of months. Entire industries, like hotels and airlines, have all but shut down, and the rest of the economy is slowing as people stay indoors and the panic from the coronavirus shock turns into an ongoing recession.

When the economy is collapsing like this, there’s an actor who is supposed to step in: the Federal Reserve.

While Congress occasionally steps in to offer stimulus through tax and spending programs (and it has, though it can do much more), the primary duty of preventing and mitigating recessions in the US rests with the Federal Reserve, which is obligated under federal law to minimize unemployment.

The Fed hasn’t always lived up to that mandate. Despite taking extreme, at times heroic measures to rescue the economy in 2008-’09, the Fed still oversaw a prolonged, painfully slow recovery that took a decade or more to reach full employment again. It continually undershot its inflation target, even as people were suffering from mass joblessness.

To its considerable credit, today’s Fed has been taking aggressive steps to fulfill its mandate, even bigger steps than the financial crisis-era Fed did. Fed Chair Jay Powell has committed trillions of dollars of Fed purchases to combating the coronavirus downturn and making sure businesses have easy access to credit. He has brought interest rates down to zero and taken the unprecedented step of subsidizing state and local governments by buying their bonds.

But while it’s become common to argue that the Fed is “out of bullets” since it’s done so much, nothing could be further from the truth. There’s still more the Fed can and should do to end this recession. Here’s what it has done so far, and what work it can still do to ease the suffering of millions of Americans.

The Fed’s actions to date, summarized

Cut rates to zero

On March 15, the Fed announced that it would cut its target interest rate to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent, returning rates to the record lows they reached during the 2008-’09 recession and its aftermath.

The Fed funds rate (often colloquially called the “Fed rate” or even just the “interest rate,” given its economy-wide effects) is the primary mechanism through which the Fed influences the American economy. When the Fed uses its powers to lower the rate, that means borrowing is cheaper: Mortgage rates fall, APRs for credit cards fall, auto loans get cheaper, etc. This is meant to stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.

The Fed enforces this target both through expectations (it’s powerful enough that just saying “we’re lowering rates” causes banks and other actors to follow suit) and through “open market operations,” in which it buys up Treasury bonds with money it creates in a bid to make those bonds’ interest rates fall to its target range. (For more, see Matt Yglesias’s explainer.)

The March 15 action was actually the second move the Fed made on interest rates in response to coronavirus. On March 3, the board slashed rates from a 1.5 to 1.75 percent range to 1 to 1.25 percent, a half-point cut. Now that rates are down to 0 to 0.25 percent, there’s nowhere left to go except negative. The Fed hasn’t done that before, but it could; see more below.

Unlimited quantitative easing

The Fed hit the zero lower bound pretty quickly in the financial crisis of 2008-’09. Once it did, it moved from trying to manipulate short-run interest rates (like the federal funds rate) to long-run interest rates, like the interest paid on 10-year US Treasury bonds. Normally it does this through “quantitative easing” — just buying up massive quantities of bonds, in particular US government bonds and mortgage bonds from Fannie and Freddie. Historically the Fed has committed to buying a specific amount of bonds, either one time or every month or quarter. Its coronavirus response started that way, with $500 billion in government bond buys and $200 billion of mortgage bond buys.

Then on March 23, it announced that quantitative easing would be unlimited. The Fed declared that it would “purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” It also expanded what bonds it bought to include commercial real estate, not just home mortgages.

This was a major escalation from previous QE efforts because it assured markets that the Fed would keep acting indefinitely to keep long-term rates low. Uncertainty about whether QE will abruptly end, or fall short of what’s necessary, could harm the recovery, so the Fed tried to eliminate that uncertainty entirely.

Skeptics of QE argue that it hurts savers (like pension firms) at the expense of people with debts. That’s part of the point, to help people get out from under debt incurred during the recession and to encourage people and businesses to take out more debt. But it provoked some political backlash.

Buying up corporate bonds

The same day that the Fed announced unlimited QE, it also announced the creation of a variety of programs to buy up bonds not covered by the QE program. Those include new and old corporate bonds and bonds backed by consumer debt other than mortgages (student loans, auto loans, credit card loans). It also announced it would set up a “Main Street Business Lending Program” to facilitate lending to small businesses.

These programs ensure that interest rates on these kinds of loans to individuals and businesses don’t get too high and that there’s a market to buy them. That way, banks have an incentive to keep issuing loans, knowing the Fed at least could buy them.

“Traditional logic would say that actions in the corporate bond market (which is tapped by bigger businesses) should trickle down to small businesses and consumer credit,” Yglesias explained when these moves were announced. “But today’s Fed isn’t taking chances. … All kinds of loans — federal government debt, consumer debt, corporate debt, mortgage debt, commercial real estate debt, and small business debt — are going to get help.”

Later, on April 9, the Fed announced various moves to strengthen these efforts to buy up different types of debt. It offered new loans to small businesses participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, committed to buying as much as $600 billion in loans from small businesses, and expanded the size or scope of the corporate and consumer bond purchase facilities. It also …

Buying state and local bonds

… set up a $500 billion fund to buy bonds from state governments and a few large local ones, which are seeing tax revenues collapse and are much more constrained than the federal government when it comes to spending. Buying up the bonds cheap helps stabilize the municipal bond market and makes it more affordable for states and cities to take out loans now to cover pandemic expenses.

In total, the April 9 actions added $2.3 trillion to the Fed’s purchasing efforts.

Options still on the table

Negative interest rates

The Fed has set interest rates at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent. This means it’s hit the “zero lower bound” — it can’t cut interest rates any further without going negative.

That said, it can go negative. The European Central Bank has been experimenting with modestly negative interest rates since June 2014, and the Bank of Japan has since January 2016. The Fed has never done the same, but these are not normal times.

Under a negative rate system, investors have to actually pay borrowers to take their money — that is, it would actually cost you to put money in the bank. The idea is that this would push you to spend your money instead of parking it in your account.

The ECB rate is only -0.5 percent, a very small cost to most depositors. But if rates get too negative, there’s a risk that businesses and individuals will start pulling their money from banks entirely and holding cash; if your checking account is losing, say, 5 percent of its value a year, there’s a good case for taking your money out and stuffing it under a mattress.

There are ways to get around that, though. Harvard economist Greg Mankiw has suggested that the Fed could declare all paper money with a serial number ending in “0” invalid, effective a year from now. That sets up an effective rate of negative 10 percent, so if the Fed sets a rate of, say, negative 6 percent on money still in the bank, that’s still an incredibly appealing proposition compared to getting a tenth of your cash wiped out.

Miles Kimball at the University of Colorado has proposed a similar system wherein the Fed would set up an “exchange rate” between paper and electronic money, so that when you deposit $100 in cash, less than $100 is added to your bank balance. That would similarly enable negative rates and limit the incentive to hoard cash, since it can’t be deposited and used to pay checks, credit card bills, etc., and most people have bills they can’t pay in cash.

Explicitly set government bond rates

One idea publicly floated by now-Deputy Fed Chair Richard Clarida would be to take quantitative easing a step further and commit to buying up US government bonds until rates on long-term (10- and 30-year) bonds hit an explicit target — say, 0 percent.

This would have several benefits. One, it would provide some focus for the Fed’s commitment to unlimited quantitative easing by making it clear what the goal of that measure is. The Fed is clear that it wants to lower long-term interest rates, but not what it wants to lower them to, and clarifying that in terms of government bonds could give quantitative easing more power and make it more effective in lowering those rates and making it cheaper for individuals and businesses to take out long-term loans.

Second, it would help Congress in developing their own response. Mandating that government bond rates are 0 or negative in inflation-adjusted terms would give Congress a guarantee that it can cut taxes and boost spending as much as necessary to fight the downturn, without risking runaway debt; it would be free or cheaper than free to borrow.

Target levels, not rates

Currently the Fed targets a given rate of inflation — 2 percent per year, for instance. What it tries to communicate to markets is that if inflation goes above that rate, it will take action to contain it, and conversely that if inflation falls below that rate, it will take action to increase it.

The problem has been that the Fed’s obedience to this target has been asymmetrical. Inflation has undershot the Fed’s target for well over a decade now:

The Fed not only hasn’t been able to get it much higher but also hasn’t tried to get prices of goods and services to where they would have been if the US had had steady 2 percent inflation every year from, say, 2008 to present.

Many economists have called for the Fed, in response to this failure, to adopt “level targeting” — not simply trying to hit a given rate of inflation, but trying to get consumer prices to where they ought to have been if inflation had hit the Fed’s target every single year. That means committing to aggressive action, and several years of above-trend inflation (say, 4 or 5 percent annually), to get back on track.

This suggestion is often paired with a proposal to move from targeting inflation to targeting nominal GDP — the size of the economy, not adjusting for inflation. The hope is that NGDP reflects both the rate of inflation and the underlying state of the economy, and targeting it could force the Fed to be more aggressive when economic growth is lagging and unemployment is rising. The Fed has a statutory duty to minimize both unemployment and inflation, and NGDP offers one way to do that.

Let low-income countries print dollars

One of the Fed’s less recognized policy tools is “swap lines”: defined arrangements that let other countries trade their currencies for dollars. The idea is that the dollar is a stable global reserve currency, whereas other countries’ currencies tend to be less stable, creating risk around exchange rates that can deter investment, especially in developing countries. Expanding access to credit in dollars can thus help safeguard other countries’ economies.

The Fed has long had these in operation with rich countries like the UK, Canada, and those represented by the European Central Bank, but recently expanded them to include a few emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil. Expanding to even more developing countries could help them recover.

Helicopter money, or printing money and giving it to people

Perhaps the most straightforward way for the Fed to help the economy would be to put money directly in people’s hands by printing it and mailing out checks.

It’s doubtful the Fed can do this under current statutory authority, but some in Congress have argued for giving it that authority. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) has proposed $2,000-per-month checks to adults and $1,000-per-month checks to children funded by printing money. A simpler idea would be to simply let the Fed send out checks the same way that Congress did through its recent $1,200 check initiative.

Helicopter drops have a long and distinguished history as a monetary policy idea; Ben Bernanke, for instance, has argued they have a place in the policy toolkit. The Fed has traditionally shied away because it views giving money to people as the domain of fiscal policy and thus of Congress. Congress could remove that hesitation by explicitly authorizing the Fed to drop helicopter money. The Bank of England is already doing something like this by directly funding government operations via printing money, so the Fed would be in good company.

Buy corporate stocks

The Fed has supported corporations by backstopping the corporate bond market and ensuring that short- and long-term interest rates remain low. But there are other actions it could take as well, though they would potentially require authorization from Congress.

The most straightforward option would be to buy corporate stocks, the way the Bank of Japan has done in recent years. That not only helps stabilize the stock market directly, it enables the Fed to set up a sovereign wealth fund invested in the US economy whose profits it can refund to the Treasury. That effectively provides a way to finance federal spending besides taxes and debt, which can be helpful if we need more fiscal stimulus in the future.

Share All sharing options for: I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

SEONGNAM, South Korea — On April 15, millions of people across South Korea donned face masks, rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer to cast their votes in a nationwide election.

Poll workers wore face protection, masks, and medical gloves. Upon arrival at the polling station, voters’ temperatures were taken, and anyone showing signs of fever was taken to a more secluded area of the building to cast their ballots. Separate polling stations were set up outside of hospitals for people infected with Covid-19 to vote.

The strict health and safety measures South Korea’s government put in place for election day could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the world — including the United States — on how to safely hold an election amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In-person voting is a risky prospect right now, as public health experts warn that having large numbers of people gather in small, enclosed areas like polling places is one of the surest ways to spread the extremely contagious coronavirus.

This scenario played out in Wisconsin last week, when Republican lawmakers and the state’s conservative-controlled Supreme Court rejected the Democratic governor’s attempts to postpone the state’s scheduled elections or change voting rules to allow people to vote by mail.

The result was a political and public health nightmare: Wisconsin voters were forced to either stay home and forfeit their votes or violate the state’s stay-at-home measures and risk their health to cast their votes in person at their local polling places. Thousands chose the latter option.

With little time to prepare, poll workers scrambled to do whatever they could to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Photos showed voters — many wearing masks, but some not — trying to maintain social distancing guidelines (remaining at least 6 feet apart) as best they could while standing in long lines waiting to vote, before being ushered into cramped schools, gyms, public libraries, and churches to cast their ballots.

The state’s public health officials have said it could be weeks before they know whether Wisconsin’s elections triggered a wider outbreak of the coronavirus, and some state party officials worry the chaos around the election has damaged its legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.

But as South Korea’s very different experience on Wednesday shows, things didn’t have to go that way.

South Korean voters had to go through extensive sanitization measures

As of election day, April 15, South Korea had nearly 10,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 220 deaths. The country saw its peak of Covid-19 cases on February 29, when it recorded more than 900 new cases. Now, a month and a half later, the number of new cases lingers at around 30 a day — one of the quickest turnarounds for any country struggling with the virus.

Experts credit the drastic drop in numbers to a proactive government that has pushed aggressive preventive measures and consistent testing. The government bet on these same methods to safely hold the first national election by a country during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Entering the polling station was an extensive process. My polling station in Pangyo, Seongnam, was a community center within my apartment complex. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10 am, which is when voters usually swarm to the polls.

As soon as I walked through the entrance, I had to stop at a “sanitizing station” where four officials stood armed with a thermometer that took my temperature when hovered above my forehead, several bottles of hand sanitizer, and boxes of disposable gloves.

Once they checked I had a mask on (I had brought one from home), they took my temperature to ensure that I showed no fever; those who had a temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) were escorted to a separate polling booth in a secluded area before being sent for virus testing. They then squeezed hand sanitizer into my palms and gave me gloves to cover my clean hands.

Officials had already marked the floors ahead of time with stickers spaced one meter (3.28 feet) apart to ensure that voters were safely distanced while standing in line. Most people adhered to the stickers, and when a few inched up to the people in front of them out of impatience, the head supervisor of the poll instantly shooed them back into place.

The only time I took off my mask was when an official compared my face with my photo ID, which was required in the South Korean elections, and the entire process only lasted about 10 seconds.

Once it was my turn, I walked into one of the four voting booths, lined up a few feet apart from the other voters, with two paper ballots in my hand. The stamp I used to mark my vote slipped a bit in my gloved hands, but the gloves were necessary since there weren’t sanitizer wipes available to wipe down any surfaces. The government said it would frequently sanitize polling stations, but the booth wasn’t disinfected before the next voter walked in after me.

Once I cast my ballot, I was ushered to a large pink trash bag taped to the wall, dedicated to the disposal of gloves. A poll worker pointed to the trash bag and then to my hands to indicate I needed to remove my gloves before leaving.

Despite the long line and multiple sanitization steps, I was in and out of the building in less than 10 minutes.

Separate polling booths were set up outside of hospitals for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, and those in more severe conditions mailed in their ballots.

The largest group the government had to address was the nearly 60,000 people in quarantine; 22.8 percent of these people — a total of 13,642 — applied to vote and were given the option to leave their houses at 5:20 pm to arrive at their polling stations by 6 pm, after the rest of the population finished voting.

They had an hour to cast their ballots and return to their homes by 7 pm. The BBC reported that they then had to call the government to announce their return home; failure to do so could lead to a visit from the police.

It’s an efficient system, but it’s not foolproof. There are still some risk factors that make experts like Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, wary.

Kim said it all depends on the cooperation of the quarantined people. If they fail to follow the rules, it could easily lead to another outbreak.

Related Democrats should make voting reform a nonnegotiable baseline for the next stimulus bill

“I’m concerned that some people might finish voting before 7 pm and use their remaining time to wander, such as going shopping or visiting coffee shops,” he said. “They may think they’re harmless because they don’t seem sick, but we already know that asymptomatic people can transfer the virus.”

Ultimately, the success of this election won’t be tested until two weeks from now, once the incubation period of the virus is over. But if there isn’t a major surge in cases by then, the US could learn a few lessons on how to successfully hold elections, especially as November inches closer.

Most people seemed to feel comfortable voting because of the government’s effective response to the pandemic

The masks, hand sanitizer, and plastic gloves may have been an odd sight, but in many ways, election day felt like any other election: Families arrived in groups at polling stations, some brought their pets, and neighbors greeted each other at the entrance.

Kim Yu-jin, 36, who wheeled her child in a stroller as she voted with her husband, said she was happy with the way the elections were held.

“The government was perfectly prepared,” she said. “As a country, we’ve already been doing a good job at social distancing, and individuals have been proactively using masks and hand sanitizer. Everyone’s been trying to be as cautious as possible, which helped boost the government’s efforts to ensure a safe election.”

Bu Kyeong-hee, 48, said opening the polls as planned was not only the best way to ensure a smooth election but also the most logical step for a country that is slowly easing back into normal life. She added that other countries could learn from the aggressive measures taken by both the government and individuals to prevent infections and maintain social distancing while proceeding with crucial democratic events.

Hwang Sung-ha, 37, also thought it was appropriate for the government to push forward with the election because people could have a direct say in picking officials who would rebuild the country ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Not everyone agrees, though: While Lee Kyeong-sook, 67, also said she was impressed by how the government handled the election, she said she had initially hoped for the government to postpone the event.

“My friends and I all agreed that we wished the government had delayed the election,” she said. “They’ve already been asking people my age to stay inside, so I wonder why they pushed for us to show up at the polls today.”

But ultimately, Lee — who cast her ballot along with more than 29 million others around the country — said she did so because it’s her duty as a citizen. Voting is a right that Koreans obtained only in 1948, which is why she considers it so important to voice her opinion through elections.

“We need to come together for the best of our country — especially during times like this,” she said.

https://www.vox.com/,"Texas has one of the most restrictive absentee ballot laws in the country. Even under ordinary circumstances, this means many Texans will have a tougher time casting a ballot than voters in most other states.

During a pandemic that could prevent millions of voters from venturing to the polls, however, Texas’s law could wind up disenfranchising much of the state.

The law only allows Texas voters to obtain an absentee ballot under a very limited list of circumstances. Voters may obtain an absentee ballot if they plan to be absent from their home county on Election Day, if they have a “sickness or physical condition” that prevents them from voting in person, if they are over the age of 65, or if they are jailed.

It is far from clear that a healthy person who remains at home to avoid contracting coronavirus may obtain an absentee ballot.

Texas Democratic Party v. Hughs, a lawsuit filed by the state Democratic Party, seeks to fix this law — or, at least, to interpret the law in a way that will ensure healthy people can still vote. But the lawsuit potentially faces an uphill battle in a state court system dominated by conservative judges.

All nine members of the state Supreme Court are Republicans, and Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a motion seeking to intervene in the lawsuit — a sign that he intends to resist efforts to prevent this law from disenfranchising voters.

The stakes in this case are astoundingly high. As Texas Democrats note in their complaint, voters are “now heavily discouraged” from even leaving their homes “by various government orders and are being discouraged in an enormous public education campaign.”

Even if the pandemic were to end by July 14, when the state plans to hold several runoff elections, “certain populations will feel the need and/or be required to continue social distancing.” Millions of voters could potentially be forced to choose between losing their right to vote and risking contracting a deadly disease.

Texas’s absentee ballot law is unusually strict

There is no federal law mandating that states provide minimal access to absentee voting, though Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) proposed legislation that would expand access to mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, states are largely free to decide how easy it should be to obtain an absentee ballot.

Five states — Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Utah, and Hawaii — automatically mail ballots to voters in the weeks before the election. Most of the remaining states have a “no excuse” absentee ballot regime, meaning that a voter has to affirmatively request a mailed-in ballot, but any voter many do so.

Texas is among the minority of states that require voters to give an excuse before they can cast a ballot. A little more than a dozen states require voters to justify their request for a ballot, according to the advocacy group Vote at Home. In Texas, the list of valid justifications is fairly short, and these exceptions are drafted fairly narrowly.

At least some states that require voters to justify absentee ballot requests have medical exemptions broad enough to accommodate voters who are staying at home during a pandemic. West Virginia’s law, for example, allows “any voter who is confined to a specific location and prevented from voting in person” to obtain an absentee ballot if their confinement is due to “disability, illness, injury, or other medical reason.”

In any event, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) handed down an executive order this week that, in his words, “requires all Texans to stay at home” except when doing certain essential activities. His order mirrors similar requests by state and local officials throughout the country. And even without such an order, many Texans will understandably be unwilling to risk their health to go to the polls.

Whether these Texans can get an absentee ballot could end up depending on how the courts interpret the phrase “physical condition.”

The Texas Democratic Party lawsuit turns on the meaning of two words

The Texas Democratic Party case turns on the meaning of two words that appear in a section of Texas law permitting people with disabilities to obtain absentee ballots: “a qualified voter is eligible for early voting by mail if the voter has a sickness or physical condition that prevents the voter from appearing at the polling place on Election Day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring the voter’s health.”

On the one hand, the law explicitly labels this provision as an accommodation for people who have a “disability.” The words “physical condition” also appear in conjunction with the word “sickness,” which implies that those words should be interpreted to refer to some sort of disabling condition that only a subset of Texans possess. Often, when a law uses a general term in the context of other, more specific terms, courts will assume that the general term should be given a narrow reading — one similar to the specific terms.

On the other hand, the literal meaning of the words “physical condition” is much more expansive. As a team of civil rights lawyers, including several from the ACLU, argue in a motion suggesting that the state law should be read expansively, “everyone has a physical condition” that prevents them from appearing at their polling place during a pandemic — the physical condition of being susceptible to coronavirus.

Either one of these interpretations of the Texas law is plausible, and a judge could reach either conclusion using methods of statutory interpretation that are widely accepted as legitimate. One judge might argue that the words “physical condition” should be read expansively, because that is the ordinary meaning of those words. Another might argue that they must be read in context with words like “sickness.”

The problem facing the Texas Democratic Party is that, when a fair judge acting in good faith could legitimately read a law in two different ways, it is very easy for a partisan judge to choose the interpretation they prefer. And every one of the nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court is a Republican.

Because older voters tend to prefer the GOP, the Texas Republican Party has a clear interest in preserving a legal regime that allows voters over 65 to obtain an absentee ballot but makes it much harder for younger voters to do so.

That said, if Democrats lose this particular lawsuit, that does not necessarily mean millions of Texans will lose their right to vote. It’s possible a federal court could rescue Texas voters in a separate lawsuit — one that most likely has not even been filed yet — holding that the unique burden the coronavirus pandemic imposes on voters renders Texas’s strict absentee ballot law unconstitutional.

In Florida Democratic Party v. Scott (2016), for example, a federal court extended the state’s voter registration deadline after a hurricane hit the state just five days before that deadline. A similar logic could be applied to the coronavirus pandemic. A federal judge in Wisconsin recently made several tweaks to that state’s election procedures in order to prevent voters from being disenfranchised by coronavirus.

But such an order could ultimately be appealed to the US Supreme Court. And the Court’s current majority isn’t especially friendly to voting rights.

America’s election law simply wasn’t written with a pandemic in mind

The overarching problem in cases like Texas Democratic Party is that America’s election law simply was not drafted in anticipation of a public health crisis that would force most of the country to remain in their homes.

Until very recently, absentee ballots were not an especially partisan issue. The red state of Utah, after all, is extraordinarily friendly to voting by mail. Meanwhile, blue states like Massachusetts and Connecticut have absentee ballot laws that are arguably more restrictive than Texas’s. (Although the courts in those blue states are much more likely to be accommodating to voters facing disenfranchisement.)

Now that a crisis has arisen, however, many partisans are likely to seek advantage where they can. Texas Republicans, for example, have a lot to gain from an election regime that makes it easy for voters over 65 to vote, while simultaneously disenfranchising huge swaths of young voters. In 2016, Donald Trump won older voters by 7 points, even though he lost the overall popular vote.

Texas didn’t necessarily write its absentee ballot law with the goal of benefiting one party. But now that a pandemic is upon us, that law has profound partisan implications if it is not corrected.

Similarly, there are a number of election law doctrines that were simply not designed for an age when judges are having to decide, often on very short notice, whether to enjoin state voting laws while an election is looming. Potentially the most troubling is a rule the Supreme Court announced in Purcell v. Gonzalez (2006).

Purcell warned that judges should be reluctant to hand down decisions altering the rules a state uses to administer an election as that election draws close. “Court orders affecting elections,” the Court said, “can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”

But the number of people infected by coronavirus grows exponentially. And voting rights lawyers won’t necessarily be able to see the problems created by this pandemic coming until they are already happening. Judges will face novel questions, and will need to make quick decisions about laws that historically have not been especially controversial.

If they can’t adapt the law quickly, millions of Americans could be disenfranchised by election laws that simply were not designed with a pandemic in mind.",1

The overarching problem in cases like Texas Democratic Party is that America’s election law simply was not drafted in anticipation of a public health crisis that would force most of the country to remain in their homes.

Until very recently, absentee ballots were not an especially partisan issue. The red state of Utah, after all, is extraordinarily friendly to voting by mail. Meanwhile, blue states like Massachusetts and Connecticut have absentee ballot laws that are arguably more restrictive than Texas’s. (Although the courts in those blue states are much more likely to be accommodating to voters facing disenfranchisement.)

Now that a crisis has arisen, however, many partisans are likely to seek advantage where they can. Texas Republicans, for example, have a lot to gain from an election regime that makes it easy for voters over 65 to vote, while simultaneously disenfranchising huge swaths of young voters. In 2016, Donald Trump won older voters by 7 points, even though he lost the overall popular vote.

Texas didn’t necessarily write its absentee ballot law with the goal of benefiting one party. But now that a pandemic is upon us, that law has profound partisan implications if it is not corrected.

Similarly, there are a number of election law doctrines that were simply not designed for an age when judges are having to decide, often on very short notice, whether to enjoin state voting laws while an election is looming. Potentially the most troubling is a rule the Supreme Court announced in Purcell v. Gonzalez (2006).

Purcell warned that judges should be reluctant to hand down decisions altering the rules a state uses to administer an election as that election draws close. “Court orders affecting elections,” the Court said, “can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”

But the number of people infected by coronavirus grows exponentially. And voting rights lawyers won’t necessarily be able to see the problems created by this pandemic coming until they are already happening. Judges will face novel questions, and will need to make quick decisions about laws that historically have not been especially controversial.

If they can’t adapt the law quickly, millions of Americans could be disenfranchised by election laws that simply were not designed with a pandemic in mind.",1
https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s latest spin is that while he always took the coronavirus seriously, his early efforts to respond to it were hampered by World Health Organization misinformation and a lack of warnings from American government officials. He’s rewriting history.

On Friday morning, Trump, echoing something he saw on Fox News, accused the WHO of making “several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading” in January and February.

Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

In fact, Trump was warned many times about the virus early on — both by officials from his government and from the WHO. But rather than heed those warnings, he spent January and February downplaying the threat. He told Americans they had nothing to worry about because his government had it under control. He only treated the pandemic with the seriousness it requires when it became undeniable that the country was headed into the crisis we’re now dealing with.

With a tough reelection fight looming and the economy in tatters, those facts are inconvenient for Trump. He’s now trying to prematurely move on from the coronavirus and put his slow response down the memory hole.

Trump has done the same thing he’s accusing the WHO of doing

America isn’t over the coronavirus hump yet. A record 4,591 people died from the virus in a 24-hour period ending Thursday evening. But Trump is cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the country’s lack of testing capacity to justify quickly reopening relatively unscathed parts of the country. And as he does that, he’s trying to change the topic from his administration’s performance to the WHO.

To be clear, it’s fair to criticize the WHO for a tweet it posted on January 14 citing “[p]reliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities” that found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” That turned out to be devastatingly wrong. But Trump should also look in the mirror.

On January 24, for instance, he publicly praised China’s handling of the coronavirus, saying the US “greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.” Most experts now believe the Chinese government was hiding the full extent of the outbreak.

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

And if Trump’s criticism is that the WHO spread dangerous misinformation, then he’s on thin ice there as well. The president has regularly pushed unproven and potentially lethal drugs as miracle cures. On Thursday, he posted tweets encouraging anti-stay-at-home-order protests in Minnesota and Michigan that could become vectors for spreading the virus.

While Trump is now trying to cast the WHO as a villain, the reality is that the US coronavirus response would’ve been much more effective had he actually followed some of the organization’s key recommendations about testing and social distancing. Instead, Trump sat idly by while the virus spread across the country in a mostly undetected manner in February and only embraced social distancing in mid-March, when public healths experts begin to sound the alarm about the possibility that American hospitals could be overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients like ones in China and Italy were.

This isn’t to say the WHO is blameless. The organization can also be fairly criticized for waiting until January 30 to declare coronavirus a public health emergency. But that declaration had no discernible impact on Trump, who on that very same day proclaimed that “we think we have [the coronavirus] very well under control.”

“We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully,” Trump added. “But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.”

As we know now, the virus was anything but under control in the country at that time. But Trump didn’t just ignore the WHO — he also ignored warnings coming from his own government.

Trump was warned — but didn’t listen

During his press briefing on Thursday, Trump tried to portray himself as a victim. He described himself as “angry” because “people knew [the coronavirus outbreak] was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it.”

Trump says he's angry he wasn't told there was an epidemic: ""And I was angry, because this should have been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn't want to talk about it."" pic.twitter.com/XgWWaXAWTF — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) April 16, 2020

Those comments came days after Trump tried to push back on an in-depth New York Times report about his slow coronavirus response by tweeting that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar “told me nothing” about the coronavirus until after Trump restricted travel from China — a commendable move but one that came after the virus was already spreading in the US.

The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Trump’s claim about Azar is at odds with what multiple unnamed senior administration officials told the Washington Post. From a report published on March 20:

Inside the White House, Trump’s advisers struggled to get him to take the virus seriously, according to multiple officials with knowledge of meetings among those advisers and with the president. Azar couldn’t get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18, according to two senior administration officials. When he reached Trump by phone, the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market, the senior administration officials said.

Although Trump now wants people to believe he wasn’t adequately warned, that same Post report says intelligence agencies “were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February,” with one unnamed US official telling the paper that “Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it. ... The system was blinking red.”

It’s not just that one report, either. Trump also ignored White House memos prepared in January and February by his top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, including one addressed directly to him on February 23 warning in its very first sentence that “There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.”

Not only did Trump not heed that warning, but he did the opposite by telling Americans there was nothing to worry about. For instance, on February 26 — just three days after Navarro tried to sound the alarm — Trump held a news conference in which he suggested the coronavirus would soon go away on its own in the United States.

“When you have 15 [coronavirus cases], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said. (Less than two months later, the US now has nearly 700,000 cases and more than 31,000 deaths.)

On February 27, as the US confirmed case count stood at 15, Trump went even further, claiming of the coronavirus that “one day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

He has now moved the goalposts from saying the virus will go away to insisting that if as many as 100,000 American deaths would be evidence he did a good job. He’s criticizing the WHO not because he has good-faith concerns about the organization, but because it’s a useful distraction that is being amplified by loyal media outlets like Fox News.

https://www.vox.com/,"It has been clear for some time that the coronavirus pandemic is killing black and Latino Americans at disproportionately high rates, but new data from the last few days reveals just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been for people of color.

Starting in New York City, the American epicenter of the outbreak: Black New Yorkers are dying at twice the rate of their white peers; Latinos in the city are also succumbing to the virus at a much higher rate than white or Asian New Yorkers. The same trends can be seen in infection and hospitalization rates, too.

Mother Jones compiled data from all of the states that break out their coronavirus data by race and ethnicity. The same thing we’re seeing in New York City is happening across the country: Black and Latino Americans get infected with Covid-19 at alarmingly high rates and more are dying than we would expect based on their share of the population.

A few horrifying examples from the charts you can find in the link above:

In Wisconsin, black people represent 6 percent of the population and nearly 40 percent of Covid-19 fatalities

In Louisiana, black people make up 32 percent of the state’s population but almost 60 percent of fatalities

In Kansas, 6 percent of the population is black and yet black people account for more than 30 percent of the Covid-19 deaths

The proportions can change depending on the state, but the trends are consistent anywhere you look: Compared to their share of the population, greater numbers of people of color die than their white neighbors in this pandemic.

Why is that? Well, there are the more acute reasons (black and Latino people are being put at risk more in their day-to-day lives) and then there are the structural reasons (long-standing economic and health disparities between white people and people of color).

On the first, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in NYC is a useful and disturbing example. As the New York Times reported last week, bus and subway workers have been hit hard by the coronavirus: 41 dead and more than 6,000 either diagnosed with Covid-19 or self-quarantining because they have symptoms that suggest an infection, as of April 8.

Who works for the MTA? Black people and Latinos. They account for more than 60 percent of the agency’s workforce in New York City, according to estimates from 2016.

Black people in particular are overrepresented in the MTA; they are 46 percent of the city’s transportation workers versus 24 percent of its overall population. (White people, on the other hand, make up 30 percent of local MTA employees but 43 percent of NYC residents.)

This is, again, true across cities and sectors. As Devan Hawkins wrote in the Guardian, black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be employed in the essential services that have been exempted from state stay-at-home orders, and they are more likely to work in health care and in hospitals. In America as in other countries, health care workers make up a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases.

So the steps states and cities have taken to restrict public activities and slow the spread of the coronavirus, while undoubtedly necessary and productive, have still left people of color more exposed to infection and, ultimately, death during the pandemic.

Those risks are exacerbated by long-standing health inequities in America.

As Fabiola Cineas wrote for Vox last week, black Americans have historically had higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure than white Americans — all of which make a patient more vulnerable to developing a severe case of Covid-19 and ultimately dying.

I would add that they are also more likely to be uninsured, again for both structural reasons (all the states in the Deep South except for Louisiana have refused to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts black people) and because of the immediate crisis (black people were more likely to lose their job in the recent surge in unemployment). The same is true for Latinos.

And those are the macro trends. All over the country, smaller controversies and policy choices also worsen the health of black Americans and weaken their ability to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even something as seemingly simple as clean water to wash hands can be hard to come by for people of color, as this reporting by Khushbu Shah for Vox on Detroit (with 13,000 cases and 1,000 deaths in Wayne County) reveals:

Since 2014, over 140,000 homes in Detroit have had their water service disconnected as part of a debt-payment program, according to records obtained by local news outlet the Bridge. In 2019, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31, had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report). “They put the onus on the customer to have to go in and take affirmative steps [to restore their water], so there are a lot of people who do not know, or secondly, don’t have the ability to go in and meet with someone,” says veteran civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings, who is working to restore water to the city’s most vulnerable. Her daughter, a Detroit teacher and a cancer survivor, is battling coronavirus. Community groups, in the meantime, she said, are passing around five gallons of water to residents who don’t have water for drinking, cooking, or bathing, but Jennings doubts that residents are using the scarce water they have to wash their hands. “If the primary recommendation is ‘wash your hands, continuously, wash your hands,’ and there’s no water in the house to wash your hands,” the number of cases is certain to skyrocket, Jennings says.

For decades — centuries, really — America has failed the black and brown people who call it home. Today, as the coronavirus continues to take its toll, they are stuck paying the price for that failure.

Toby Ord on existential risk, Donald Trump, and thinking in probabilities

April 9, 2020 | Oxford philosopher Toby Ord spent the early part of his career spearheading the effective altruism movement, founding Giving What We Can, and focusing his attention primarily on issue areas like global public health and extreme poverty. Ord’s new book The Precipice is about something entirely different: the biggest existential risks to the future of humanity. In it, he predicts that humanity has approximately a 1 in 6 chance of going completely extinct by the end of the 21st century. The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that tail risk is real. We always knew a zoological respiratory virus could become a global pandemic. But, collectively, we didn’t want to think about it, and so we didn’t. The result is the reality we live in now.

But for all the current moment’s horror, there are worse risks than coronavirus out there. One silver lining of the current crisis might be that it gets us to take them seriously, and avert them before they become unstoppable. That’s what Ord’s book is about, and it is, in a strange way, a comfort.

This, then, is a conversation about the risks that threaten humanity’s future, and what we can do about them. It’s a conversation about thinking in probabilities, about the ethics of taking future human lives seriously, about how we weigh the risks we don’t yet understand.

Elizabeth Warren has a plan for this, too

April 6, 2020 | In January, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to release a plan for combatting coronavirus. In March, she released a second plan. Days later, with the scale of economic damage increasing, she released a third. Warren’s proposals track the spread of the virus: from a problem happening elsewhere and demanding a surge in global health resources to a pandemic happening here, demanding not just a public health response, but an all-out effort to save the US economy. Warren’s penchant for planning stands in particular stark contrast to this administration, which still has not released a clear coronavirus plan. There is no document you can download, no web site you can visit, that details our national strategy to slow the disease and rebuild the economy.

So I asked Warren to return to the show to explain what the plan should be, given the cold reality we face. We discussed what, specifically, the federal government should do; the roots of the testing debacle; her idea for mobilizing the economy around building affordable housing; why she thinks that this is exactly the right time to cancel student loan debt; why America spends so much money preparing for war and so little defending itself against pandemics and climate change; whether she thinks the Democratic primary focused on the wrong issues; and how this crisis is making a grim mockery of Ronald Reagan’s old saw about “the scariest words in the English language.”

What social solidarity demands of us in a pandemic

April 2, 2020 | There is no doubt that social distancing is the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But the efficacy of social distancing (or really any other public health measure) relies on something much deeper and harder to measure: social solidarity.

“Solidarity,” writes Eric Klinenberg, “motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor’s door.” Klinenberg, a sociologist by trade, is the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. His first book, Heat Wave, found that social connection was, at times, literally the difference between life and death during Chicago’s 1995 heat wave. Since then, he’s spent his career studying trends in American social life, from the rise of adults living alone to the importance of “social infrastructure” in holding together our civic bonds.

This conversation is about what happens when a country mired in a mythos of individualism collides with a pandemic that demands social solidarity and collective sacrifice. It’s about preventing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation from overwhelming the most vulnerable among us. We discuss the underlying social trends that predated coronavirus, what kind of leadership it takes to actually bring people together, the irony of asking young people and essential workers to sacrifice for the rest of us, whether there’s an opportunity to build a different kind of society in the aftermath of Covid-19, and much more.

Coronavirus has pushed US-China relations to their worst point since Mao

March 30, 2020 | The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder that the worst really can happen. Tail risk is real risk. Political leaders fumble, miscalculate, and bluster into avoidable disaster. And even as we try to deal with this catastrophe, the seeds of another are sprouting.

The US-China relationship will define geopolitics in the 21st century. If we collapse into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism, the results could be hellish. And we are, right now, collapsing into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism.

The Trump administration, and key congressional Republicans, are calling COVID-19 “the Chinese virus,” and trying to gin up tensions to distract from their domestic failures. Chinese government officials, beset by their own domestic problems, are claiming the US military brought the virus to China. The US-China relationship was in a bad way six months ago, but this is a new level of threat.

Is the cure worse than the disease?

March 26, 2020 | “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself!” That was President Donald Trump, this week, explaining why he was thinking about lifting coronavirus guidelines earlier than public-health experts recommended.

This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously. Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

An economic crisis like we’ve never seen

March 23, 2020 | “What is happening,” writes Annie Lowrey, “is a shock to the American economy more sudden and severe than anyone alive has ever experienced.”

It’s also different from what anyone alive has ever experienced. For many of us, the Great Recession is the closest analogue — but it’s not analogous at all. There, the economy’s potential was unchanged, but financial markets were in crisis. Here, we are purposefully freezing economic activity in order to slow a public health crisis. Early data suggests the economic crisis is going to far exceed any single week or quarter of the financial crisis. Multiple economists have told Ezra Klein that the nearest analogy to what we’re going through is the economy during World War II.

“I have a secret advantage when trying to understand moments of economic upheaval. I’m married to Annie Lowrey,” writes Ezra Klein. “I can give you the bio — staff writer at the Atlantic, author of Give People Money (which is proving particularly prophetic and influential right now) — but suffice to say she’s one of the clearest and most brilliant economic thinkers I know. Her viral piece on the affordability crisis is crucial for understanding what the economy really looked like before Covid-19, and she’s been doing some of the best work on the way Covid-19 will worsen the economic problems we had and create a slew of new ones. But this isn’t just a conversation about crisis. It’s also a conversation about how to respond. I wouldn’t call it hopeful — we’re not there yet. But constructive.”

“The virus is more patient than people are”

March 19, 2020 | Ron Klain served as the chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. In 2014, President Barack Obama tapped him to lead the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. He successfully oversaw a hellishly complex effort preparing domestically for an outbreak and surging health resources onto another continent to contain the disease.

But Klain is quick to say that the coronavirus is a harder challenge even than Ebola. The economy is in free fall. Entire cities have been told to shelter in place. And there’s no telling how long any of this will last. In this conversation, Klain answers Ezra Klein’s questions about the disease and how to respond to it, as well as questions many of you submitted.

Maggie Haberman: How coronavirus changes everything for President Trump

March 16, 2020 | Maggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for the New York Times, talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the rest of the country has bypassed Trump’s failure to lead on the coronavirus outbreak; his exposure to COVID-19 at Mar-a-Lago and refusal to self-quarantine; and the toxic cocktail of practices in his administration: Infighting, tiptoeing, and sucking up.

She also discusses CDC director Anthony Fauci’s “unimpeachable” credibility vs. President Trump’s trust problem, how Vice President Pence is doing at the helm of the coronavirus task force, and how this period could have a bigger impact on Trump’s re-election chances than previous crises.

March 13, 2020 | Epidemic co-host Ron Klain, who led the White House’s ebola response under President Obama, talks to Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the COVID-19 outbreak will strain America’s healthcare system; how President Trump downplayed the crisis, rattling public confidence and delaying the country’s response; and the way people who work in the gig economy — including Uber drivers and food delivery workers — will be especially hurt by the situation. He also discusses the logic behind travel bans and limits of their efficacy, why it’s impossible for the US to completely cut itself off from China, and what Trump didn’t say in his Oval Office address, but should have. Klain, an adviser and former chief of staff to Joe Biden, also talks about the ex-vice president’s surprisingly successful presidential campaign and how it’s reckoning with Biden’s history of verbal flubs.

https://www.vox.com/,"The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in China in December, has had sweeping effects in the public health, business, and travel sectors, among others. And while the repercussions for the entertainment industry may seem to pale in comparison to the clear threat the virus poses to human life, the ripple effects do have implications for the people around the world who make a living producing and distributing movies, music, and more.

The immense and lucrative Chinese film industry was hit almost immediately as movie theaters across the country were closed and major releases were delayed. Hollywood soon began to feel the effects, too, and as time passes, the impact of the coronavirus on the global film and entertainment industries will certainly grow.

Consequences of the pandemic on these industries could range from lowered attendance at film festivals and disruptions in film distribution to delayed or canceled movie releases and concert dates to curtailed on-location film shoots. Financial ramifications will likely be felt by studios, filmmakers, theater owners, and more for months or even years.

Here are the biggest and most significant developments in the entertainment industry in response to the pandemic. Most recently, San Diego Comic-Con was canceled, Disney postponed the release of Pixar’s latest film, Soul; Saturday Night Live performed an “at-home” show; and theater industry leaders announced that Broadway shows would remain closed through at least June and probably longer.

Major entertainment festival cancellations and postponements

K-pop concerts canceled, including BTS shows: On February 28, the hugely popular K-pop group BTS canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul. The shows were scheduled for April 11 and 12 and April 18 and 19 at Seoul’s Olympic Stadium. The group’s management agency said the decision was made due to the impossibility of predicting the scale of the outbreak in South Korea come April and cited the health and safety of the musicians themselves, workers, and concertgoers. Two hundred thousand fans were expected to attend.

Days earlier, BTS had asked fans to avoid a series of TV appearances scheduled to promote their newest album, Map Of The Soul: 7, which had originally been planned to include studio audiences. The group also appealed to fans via a streamed press conference. “Health is always on our minds these days, and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you’re healthy, especially since it is very risky outside these days,” one of the singers, Jimin, said. ”I hope you take care of yourself.”

The entire Korean entertainment sector has been affected by the outbreak, and K-pop has been hit particularly hard, with groups including GOT7, Winner, Sechs Kies, (G) I-DLE, and others canceling scheduled tour dates. Variety reported that box office revenue in South Korea was down 30 to 40 percent in January 2020 compared to previous years.

SXSW canceled: On March 6, the city of Austin, Texas, declared a state of disaster, requiring the cancellation of public gatherings and events for the near future. The most notable of those is the cancellation of South by Southwest, the annual music, film, TV, and technology festival that serves as a significant financial powerhouse for the city.

The announcement came after a week full of major companies — including Netflix, Apple, Amazon, WarnerMedia, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Mashable, Intel, and more — dropping out of the well-attended event, canceling panels, premieres, and other appearances. Days later, SXSW organizers announced that they had laid off one-third of the festival’s employees in what they called “a necessary, but heartbreaking, step.”

Emerald City Comic Con delayed: The organizing body behind Emerald City Comic Con, the largest convention of its kind in Seattle, Washington, announced on March 6 that it will postpone the event until sometime this summer. The event was scheduled to run from March 12 to 16.

“We did everything that we could to run the event as planned, but ultimately, we are following the guidance of the local public health officials indicating that conventions should now be postponed,” convention organizers Reedpop said in a statement published on the Emerald City Comic Con website.

Cannes Film Festival delayed: The 2020 edition of the Cannes Film Festival, arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, is still in question following an announcement from the festival’s organizers on March 19 that the gathering could be delayed until “late June or early July,” or another time. (The festival had been slated to take place May 12 to 23 and draws thousands of industries and press from around the globe each year.) The festival first issued a statement on February 28 after the first case of coronavirus in nearby Nice, France, was confirmed by the city’s mayor, saying that organizers were monitoring the situation but planned for the festival to go forward. (Cannes is a seaside resort town located on the French Riviera, about 30 km from Nice.)

Coachella delayed: Goldenvoice, the organizers of Coachella, one of the largest annual music festivals in the US, announced on March 10 that the festival would be postponed due to concerns about Covid-19. Another Goldenvoice festival, the country music-oriented Stagecoach, has also been postponed.

The Indio, California-based event was originally set to run for two weekends, April 10-12 and April 17-19, with the same talent lineups performing both weekends. It will now run from October 9-11 and October 16-18. Stagecoach 2020 has been pushed back from April to October 23-25.

Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) canceled: The 2020 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) — the single biggest trade show in the video game industry — has been canceled. The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes the event, announced that it would not go forward with the annual event due to coronavirus fears in California, where E3 takes place. The event was scheduled for June 9 to 11.

The organization said it will contact exhibitors and attendees about receiving full refunds for passes, and that it is considering ways to “coordinate an online experience” in lieu of the in-person event. It also maintains that E3 will return next year as planned.

The NBA suspended basketball games indefinitely: A player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on March 11, leading NBA officials to call off that night’s Jazz game just before tip-off. As a further precautionary measure, the league issued a statement that it would suspend the basketball season “until further notice.”

Prior to putting an early pause on the rest of the season, the NBA made other efforts to protect players and fans. The league barred media from locker rooms, and publicly considered having teams play to empty arenas, before ultimately stopping play altogether.

2020 Tokyo Olympics delayed: On March 24, following pressure from athletes and multiple nations’ Olympic committees, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be postponed, possibly until 2021; on March 30, the dates were set for July 23-August 8, 2021.

San Diego Comic-Con 2020 canceled: On April 17, the organizers of San Diego Comic-Con announced that the yearly fan convention will not go on as planned in 2020. The event will resume once again in July 2021 at the San Diego Convention Center. The cancellation marks the first time in Comic-Con’s 50-year history that the event, the largest convention of its kind in the US, will not take place.

Major film release dates postponed or canceled

Newest Pixar film delayed: On April 13, Disney announced that Pixar’s latest release, Soul, would open on November 20, 2020. The film was previously set to open on June 19.

Disney makes sweeping changes to release calendar: On April 3, Disney made huge changes to its release calendar, setting dates for movies it had previously pulled without a date and moving others. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020, while Jungle Cruise, which had been set to release that day, moved to July 30, 2021. An untitled Indiana Jones film moved from July 9, 2021, to July 29, 2022.

Changes in the MCU calendar set off a domino effect. Black Widow is newly set for November 6, 2020, while the previous release on that date, Shang-Chi, shifted to May 7, 2021. Originally, Doctor Strange 2 was set to release on that date; it’s now set to open November 5, 2021, displacing Thor: Love and Thunder until February 28, 2022. Black Panther 2 is still currently set for May 6, 2022, and Captain Marvel 2 moved from July 22 to July 8, 2022.

Disney also owns 20th Century Films and Searchlight Films, which had a number of changes. The Ryan Reynolds film Free Guy moved from July 3 to December 11, 2020. West Side Story is still set for December 18 and Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel for Christmas Day. Wes Anderson’s newest film, The French Dispatch, moved from July 24 to October 16, 2020.

Artemis Fowl, which has seen its release date pushed several times already, will be released on Disney+.

Release dates for The New Mutants and The Woman in the Window (originally slated for April 3 and May 15, respectively) have not been set yet.

Sony delays nearly all its movies until 2021: On March 30, Sony announced that nearly all of its summer tentpole films would be delayed until late 2020 or early 2021. Delayed movies include Kevin Hart’s Fatherhood, Jared Leto’s Morbius, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Uncharted, and the previously delayed Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. The only film that appeared unaffected was the Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel, which is still set for theatrical release on July 16, 2020.

Wonder Woman 1984 and In the Heights releases delayed: On March 24, Warner Bros. announced that it would delay the release of Wonder Woman 1984 from June 5 to August 14. The studio also pulled three films from its release schedule: In the Heights, an adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical originally scheduled for a June 26 release; Scoob, a Scooby-Doo animated film originally scheduled for May 15; and Malignant, a thriller from Aquaman director James Wan that had originally been scheduled for August 14. (Malignant’s move is designed to make room for Wonder Woman 1984’s release.)

NBCUniversal to release major films digitally: In an unprecedented move, NBCUniversal announced on March 16 that it would make some movies available digitally the same day they are released in movie theaters that remain open, including Trolls World Tour, which is set to hit theaters on April 10. Movies currently in theatrical release will also be available on-demand, including The Hunt, The Invisible Man, and Emma. Movies are available for a 48-hour rental period for $19.99 in the US and an equivalent price abroad.

Disney postpones major releases: On March 12, Disney confirmed that three of its biggest releases of the year — Mulan (scheduled for March 27), The New Mutants (scheduled for April 3), and Antlers (scheduled for April 17) — would be postponed. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020. The Chinese and European premieres of Mulan had previously been delayed as well.

On March 17, Disney announced the postponement of three more films: Black Widow (originally set for May 1), The Personal History of David Copperfield (May 8), and The Woman in the Window (May 15). The delays followed movie theater shutdowns in multiple states as well as country-wide shutdowns of Regal and AMC theaters.

Related Marvel delays the upcoming Black Widow solo film

No Time to Die: On February 16, MGM announced that it would cancel the Chinese premiere and publicity tour planned for the new James Bond movie, No Time To Die, which was scheduled for April. On March 4, the studio announced that it had delayed the film’s release until late November, making the film the first major tentpole release to be delayed worldwide.

Sonic the Hedgehog: On February 24, Paramount Pictures announced that it would delay the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in China, with a new release date to be determined.

Peter Rabbit 2: On March 10, Sony announced that it would push the global release of Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway from late March/early April to August.

A Quiet Place Part II: On March 12, A Quiet Place Part II director John Krasinski announced via Twitter that the movie’s planned March 19 release date would be delayed. “One of the things I’m most proud of is that people have said our movie is one you have to see all together. Well due to the ever-changing circumstances of what’s going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that,” he wrote. “As insanely excited as we are for all of you to see this movie ... I’m gonna wait to release the film till we CAN see it all together! So here’s to our group movie date! See you soon!”

Fast and Furious 9: On March 12, Universal Pictures announced that it would delay the release date of the ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise by 11 months, from May 22 to April 2, 2021.

Chinese movies scrapped theatrical release and premiere online: The biggest films of China’s year are usually scheduled to release during the Lunar New Year holiday, near the end of January, but mounting fears of the coronavirus and public reticence to be in crowded spaces caused distributors to voluntarily cancel or postpone several film releases. Huanxi, distributor of the Chinese blockbuster Lost in Russia, announced on January 22 that the film would premiere online for free. Promotional materials encouraged audiences to “stay safely at home and watch Lost in Russia with your mom.” On January 31, Enter the Fat Dragon became the second major Chinese film to premiere online, as theaters are closed by order of the government.

Film and TV productions halted, altered, or shut down

Saturday Night Live aired remotely produced content: On April 9, the producers of Saturday Night Live, which had been on hiatus since mid-March, announced that new, remotely produced material would air on NBC in the show’s usual Saturday night slot, 11:30 p.m. on April 11, including a “Weekend Update” segment.

The coronavirus has touched Saturday Night Live in at least two ways. The show’s long-time music supervisor, Hal Willner, passed away on April 7 at the age of 64; he was not formally diagnosed with the virus but had consistent symptoms. And Michael Che, one of the show’s co-head writers and co-anchor with Colin Jost of “Weekend Update,” announced via social media on April 6 that his grandmother had passed away from coronavirus complications.

The show joined other late-night comedy shows, such as NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, in creating comedy content remotely.

Eurovision canceled: On March 18, the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest announced via Twitter that the 2020 edition of the event was canceled. The event had been planned for May.

TV shows suspend production: Hundreds of shows have delayed or suspended production, including Apple’s The Morning Show and Little America; Netflix shows including Russian Doll; the CW’s Riverdale; NBC shows including the Chicago dramas and The Kelly Clarkson Show; CBS shows including the NCIS dramas, The Amazing Race, and Survivor; and many more.

Saturday Night Live also announced on March 16 that it would suspend its next three shows, the first of which was scheduled for March 28, with John Krasinski hosting. (Krasinski’s film A Quiet Place Part II, originally scheduled for release on March 19, was also delayed.)

Late-night shows suspend production or tape without a studio audience: Originally, on March 11, producers of shows including NBC’s The Tonight Show (hosted by Jimmy Fallon) and Late Night With Seth Meyers, CBS’s Late Show With Stephen Colbert, TBS’s Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Comedy Central’s Daily Show (hosted by Trevor Noah) all announced they would begin taping without a live studio audience on March 16.

A day later, NBC announced that The Tonight Show and Late Night would suspend production beginning the week of March 16; Stephen Colbert also announced that the Late Show would suspend production. All three shows were already scheduled to go into hiatus on March 23. On March 13, Jimmy Kimmel Live also suspended production.

Disney suspends live-action production: On March 13, Disney announced that production on its live-action movies would suspend production. Affected films include The Little Mermaid, a Home Alone reboot, and Peter Pan. Earlier in the day, production on Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings had been suspended due to director Destin Daniel Cretton’s decision to self-isolate upon advice of a doctor. (Marvel is owned by Disney.)

Jia Zhangke project delayed: At the Berlin Film Festival in February, famed Chinese director Jia Zhangke (Ash Is Purest White, A Touch of Sin) told Indiewire that production on his new film, which was slated to begin in April, was delayed indefinitely. Jia spoke with Indiewire at the Berlin Film Festival, where his documentary Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue premiered. But he said that before he left, he’d feared his flight to Berlin would be canceled, and that some of his collaborators chose not to make the trip. Regarding his next film, he said:

For some film companies and studios involved in pre-production, a lot of costs are going down the drain, and those that already started production have to be somehow cut short or suspended. Some of them are already in the process of distributing films and they’ve paid for a lot of promotion and PR costs. The economy is now taking a huge hit, and I think the investment side will be hugely impacted as well.

Mission: Impossible production paused: On February 26, Paramount Pictures announced that it had halted a planned three-week shoot in Venice for the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise. “Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan for our three-week shoot in Venice, the scheduled first leg of an extensive production for Mission: Impossible 7,” a Paramount spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter. “During this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves.”

Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune tape without a studio audience: Though Sony declined to comment, sources told the Hollywood Reporter on March 9 that scheduled tapings of the shows would go forward without a live studio audience. The measure was taken partly as a precaution for the health of Jeopardy host Alex Trebek, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announce they’ve contracted the virus: One of Hollywood’s biggest stars, Tom Hanks, announced that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the coronavirus while shooting Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film in Australia:

In a message posted publicly on March 11, Hanks was his typical upbeat self:

Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We’ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Entertainment venues and attractions shut down

All Disney parks shut down: On January 25, Disney shut down its Shanghai Disneyland park over fears of the coronavirus. The park is a major revenue generator, with 11.8 million guests in 2018, 50 percent from outside the Shanghai region, and an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue and $50 million in operating profit. A day after Shanghai Disneyland’s closure, Hong Kong Disneyland shut down. Both Disney parks in Japan closed on February 29 and Disney announced on March 11 that they will remain closed through at least the end of April.

Late in the day on March 12, Disneyland in California announced it would close the following day; by that evening, the company announced that all of its parks would close, including those in Florida and Disneyland Paris (where three staff had previously tested positive for coronavirus).

North American movie theaters shut down or begin “social distancing” measures: On March 13, a number of theaters and theater chains, including AMC Theatres, and the Canadian chain Cineplex, announced that they would be reducing the number of tickets sold to screenings by as much as 50 percent in order to enable patrons to sit further apart as part of “social distancing” measures.

On March 15, theaters in New York and Los Angeles were shut down by order of their respective mayors. On March 16, Regal announced it would shut down all of its 543 US theaters indefinitely; later in the day, AMC followed suit.

New York City cultural sites closed: On March 12, major cultural sites in New York City began to close, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other institutions canceled programming for the month of March, such as the New York Public Library and Carnegie Hall.

Within days, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that it anticipated staying closed through July and laying off much of its staff. On March 19, the Metropolitan Opera laid off all of its union employees, including musicians and chorus.

Broadway shows closed: On March 12, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that beginning at 5:00 pm, Broadway would be closed, part of a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. On April 8, the Broadway League announced that theaters would remain closed through June, and probably longer.

West End closes: On March 16, London’s West End shut down, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s speech urging Britons to avoid public spaces. The theaters, including the Royal Opera House, will stay closed indefinitely.

Italian cultural sites closed: In February, a number of major museums in Venice, Milan, Turin, and other northern Italian cities were closed as part of the government’s aggressive attempt to contain the virus, and annual Carnivale celebrations stopped early. By early March, with the country under complete lockdown, cultural sites across Italy were closed, including the Colosseum and Pompeii.

Chinese movie theaters shut down for months, tentatively begin to reopen, then re-close: Hoping to contain the coronavirus outbreak, on January 23 the Chinese government temporarily shut down movie theaters throughout the country until further notice. A total film production shutdown soon followed. Loss of revenue over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, during which movie theaters typically see an uptick in ticket sales, amounted to a staggering $1 billion, according to analysts.

By March 23, about 500 cinemas had reopened in China, roughly 5 percent of the cinemas in the country that were open before the outbreak. Variety reported that box office earnings remained minimal. But by March 27, they were closed again.

Chinese cultural attractions closed: Other cultural attractions and institutions in China that have been closed to the public include Tiananmen Square’s National Museum of China, the Forbidden City, and a section of the Great Wall of China located near Beijing.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump can’t help but sow division, even at a time when Americans are largely united in supporting stay-at-home orders and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Just after 11:21 am Eastern time on Friday, President Donald Trump posted a trio of tweets endorsing the so-called liberation of a trio of states with Democratic governors from measures they’ve taken to slow the spread of coronavirus.

These posts — which are among the most dangerous of Trump’s tenure — appear to have been inspired by a segment he saw on Fox News minutes earlier.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump began, with two further tweets saying “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd amendment. It is under siege!”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

At 11:19 — two minutes before Trump’s Minnesota tweet — Fox News ran a segment about small groups of right-wing protesters in Minnesota and Virginia who have been agitating for governors there to relax stay-at-home orders so they can resume normal shopping and traveling activities.

Watch:

Fox has extensively covered right-wing demonstrations in Michigan on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week, which echo the same theme. Early Friday afternoon, Fox News displayed chyrons promoting an anti-stay-at-home protest scheduled for later in the day in Minnesota.

Fox News’s coverage might give you the idea that these protesters represent the views of a significant chunk of people in their states. But polling indicates that’s not the case. For instance, a YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 61 percent of Americans think Trump should institute a nationwide stay-at-home order, compared to just 22 percent who are opposed. Along the same lines, polling from the Pew Research Central released on Thursday showed that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) noted in response to the so-called “Operation Gridlock” in her state, the sad irony is that such demonstrations could end up extending the need for stay-at-home orders by spreading the virus among protesters. But asked on Thursday if he thinks protesters in Michigan should listen to local officials like Whitmer, Trump said that such people listen to him instead.

“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me,” Trump said.

JON KARL: Shouldn't the anti-stay-at-home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities?



TRUMP: ""I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me."" pic.twitter.com/842jov2kY8 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

One shudders to contemplate what sorts of actions right-wing protesters might take if they interpret Trump’s call for them to “LIBERATE” their states seriously.

Share All sharing options for: This is the end of the office as we know it

If and when you return to your office after the novel coronavirus pandemic, you’ll probably notice some differences.

Upon entering your building, the doors may open automatically so you don’t have to touch the handles. Before you board your elevator, you might tell the elevator where you’d like to go, rather than pressing the many buttons within the elevator. When you reach your floor, you could walk into a room full of dividers and well-spaced desks instead of the crowded open floor plan you’re used to. In common areas like meeting rooms and kitchens, expect to see fewer chairs and posted documentation of the last time they were cleaned.

These are just the changes you can see. Less noticeable in the post-coronavirus office would be more frequent cleaning policies, antimicrobial properties woven into fabrics and materials, amped-up ventilation systems, or even the addition of UV lights for more deeply disinfecting the office at night.

Of course, this is all assuming you go back to your old office at all. As the coronavirus takes a steep toll on the economy and the workforce, many won’t have jobs to go back to. Some who are still employed will now permanently work from home, and some employers will choose to downsize their leases or look for flexible office space rather than long-term leases. Coworking spaces will probably never be what they once were as they forgo hot desks and communal spaces for more sanitary — and less profitable — private areas.

Many of these adjustments in office design are actually just accelerations of real estate trends that existed well before the pandemic. But just as policies around telehealth and liquor have quickly shifted, the Covid-19 crisis will force swift and permanent changes in both commercial real estate and work culture itself. The office as we know it will never be the same.

Working from home will be the new normal for many

According to a new MIT report, 34 percent of Americans who previously commuted to work report that they were working from home by the first week of April due to the coronavirus. That’s the same percentage of people who can work from home, according to a recent University of Chicago publication.

These new numbers represent a seismic shift in work culture. Prior to the pandemic, the number of people regularly working from home remained in the single digits, with only about 4 percent of the US workforce working from home at least half the time. However, the trend of working from home had been gaining momentum incrementally for years, as technology and company cultures increasingly accommodated it. So it’s also likely that many Americans who are now working from home for the first time will continue to do so after the pandemic.

“Once they’ve done it, they’re going to want to continue,” said Kate Lister, president of consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, which is currently running a survey about work-from-home participation. She predicts that 30 percent of people will work from home multiple days per week within a couple of years. Lister added that there has been pent-up demand by employees for greater work-life flexibility, and that the coronavirus has made their employers see the light, especially as they themselves have had to work from home.

“It had been proven prior to this, but a lot of company management and leaders showed great skepticism,” Steve King, partner at small-business consulting firm Emergent Research, told Recode. “That skepticism will go away because companies recognize that remote work does work.”

There’s a lot more at play than what employers and workers want, of course. The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs. For companies to reduce their rent obligations by letting workers work from home is an easy solution, one that’s less painful than layoffs. In Lister’s words, “The investor community is going to insist on it.”

Furthermore, the necessity of working from home brought on by the pandemic has also caused many employers and employees to spend money on new technology, like video conferencing subscriptions as well as new equipment. According to data from expense management provider Emburse, the most frequent employee expenses in the first half of March included computer monitors, desks, office supplies, mice, and keyboards — a departure from the norm. These purchases presumably happened at companies where working from home was a new development.

“Companies were caught with their pants down,” said Lister. “Companies where the technology and culture were aligned with working from home were more successful in working from home than others.”

More formalization and company policies around remote work are necessary for the shift to be successful. A recent PWC study showed that about half of businesses expect a dip in productivity during the pandemic due to a lack of remote work capabilities. Companies where people have worked from home for a while and have built up guidelines — about, say, what time of night is appropriate to expect a response on Slack, how employees can securely access company files, and whether employees are allowed to expense an at-home monitor or standing desk — will probably have an easier time working from home.

Employees themselves are also spending more money to create better home offices. Katie Storey, principal at Storey Design, says that her residential and commercial interior design firm is already seeing the trend.

“The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

“Instead of allocating a corner of the den,” she said, “there’s now a real focus on where can we convert a closet or add a room under the steps or where can we reconfigure parts of the house to be more functional work-from-home space.”

Regardless of how prepared they were, people have done what they had to do to make working from home work. In doing so, they moved the needle on what’s acceptable in the at-home office.

“It added some humanity to us,” Lister said. “You don’t have a choice: The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

Coronavirus will likely change the way office space looks and works

Working from home all the time is not for everyone, and many will want to return to the office. As the public health crisis continues, however, office space will probably have to be altered in order for people to feel safe being there. That could mean a reversal of the open office trend.

For years, the amount of privacy allotted to each person working in an office had been steadily decreasing as companies of all stripes adopted the ubiquitous — if often loathed — open office plan. In effect, that meant a very cool-looking office space where you could see many of your coworkers but where there was little separation between you and your colleagues’ germs. Prior to the open office, offices used to have, well, offices, or at least cubicles that divided up the larger space and gave employees a semblance of privacy

“I do think this is going to reshape the workplace,” Janet Pogue-McLaurin, principal and workplace leader at design and architecture firm Gensler, told Recode. “Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward.”

That means people will want more space. Following the last recession, companies had been trying to do more with less space. That meant packing more and more people into open office spaces, a practice known as “densification.”

“Densification will take a hiatus,” Pogue-McLaurin said. “We’ll shift to, ‘How do we dedensify to create the physical distancing that we now need to have?’”

That could mean more private spaces or personal offices for individuals, and more distance between desks. Rather than desk setups that face each other or are right next to each other, we might now be positioned to our colleague’s backs with more space between us. A conference room that normally fit 10 people might now only hold chairs for five. Expect greater spacing and fewer seating options in communal areas like kitchens as well.

“Every configuration of every floor plan should be assessed to look at distancing and safety,” Kate North, vice president of workplace strategy at Colliers International real estate company, said.

This could also mean the reintroduction of various types of barriers between desks, including much maligned cubicles, in order to block the passage of germs — an effort that might be harder given the prevalence these days of standing desk options.

Christine Cavataio, president and chief operating officer at architecture firm Cuningham Group, thinks that while physical barriers will be used in the short term, the more long-term architectural fix will be done with spacing.

In the immediate future, “we’ll see physical, hard things that create separation,” Cavataio said. “Over time, we will start to design differently to create space, versus how tight can we get it. Can we get our generous six feet of physical distance and still create a company environment people want to be in, knowing you have safety inherently based in the design?”

Commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield is testing a new design concept called “Six Feet Office” in which it visually displays unique foot traffic routing in the office to keep people the recommended six feet apart.

Perhaps more importantly, though less visible, will be the actions that facilities managers take to divert congestion points and clean offices. International Facility Management Association‎ (IFMA) is currently working in tandem with other specialized groups for cleaning and ventilation systems, among other things, to create guidelines and protocols for building operators around the world.

“There’s going to be a special effort to consider and think about every possible place within the built environment that a human being has touched and the possibility of that being a source of contamination,” Don Gilpin, president and chief operating officer at IFMA, said.

That effort could include everything from higher-quality air filtration systems to more-powerful cleaners. Every surface — including door handles, light switches, countertops, copy machine buttons, AV equipment, coffee makers, and many more — will have to be dealt with. According to Cavataio, regular offices will likely take cues from health care design. This shift could include the addition of things like copper fixtures, fabric that retains fewer germs and can more easily be cleaned, more space in kitchens and bathrooms, as well as more attention paid to how far liquids can splash. Some companies could even use UV lighting to disinfect offices at night or meeting rooms in between uses, a practice that’s increasingly common in hospitals.

Automation and voice technology could also play a role. Technology like Amazon Alexa for Business, for example, could become a new interface and remove the need for physically pushing a button or touching a surface in an office. As Bret Kinsella, founder & CEO of the voice technology publication Voicebot.ai, explained, “There is voice tech in warehouses today but very little in office settings. That will absolutely change.”

Inevitably, the most consequential way to prevent the spread of germs in an office might just be to limit the number of people allowed inside at once. Rather than having everyone work in the office from nine to five, companies might want to bring in certain teams at specific times to lessen congestion. The initial process of bringing employees back to work, at least, will probably be staggered.

“What we are anticipating is a gradual ramp-up of business as usual,” Gilpin said. “We are not expecting a flood gate of theaters and corporate spaces opening up to employees and the public. We see this as a gradual process.”

Demand for office space is uncertain

There are two conflicting trends that will affect whether or not the coronavirus leads to a sizable decrease in demand for office space.

First, fewer employees coming into the office, either due to layoffs or to an increase in working from home, could mean less need for office space.

“Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward”

As Tim Savage, a clinical assistant professor of real estate at NYU’s Schack Institute of Real Estate, put it, “As people are forced to work from home, personal space becomes an office. In a way, we’ve dramatically expanded the amount of office space we have.”

Second, safety protocols that require people to be spaced at least six feet apart could cause more demand for office space so that the people who work there aren’t as packed in as they used to be.

“In short, it is too early to tell if companies will lease less space,” Julie Whelan, Americas head of occupier research at commercial real estate services company CBRE, told Recode. “While they may need less space because some people may conduct some of their work remotely, they may also need more space to provide the social distancing that employees may feel they need to be comfortable.”

It’s possible these two trends will cancel each other out.

So far, CBRE has noted that as a result of the coronavirus and its containment measures, office leasing has slowed and vacancy rates are rising. But the company also says that office properties will be more insulated than other property types like hotels and retail.

“The impact on office [space] should not be as deep or broad as what was felt after the financial crisis,” Whelan said.

Experts say there will certainly be an acceleration of existing trends in office real estate, including a move away from traditional 10-year leases for shorter ones or for flexible or coworking space (more on that later). Still, the nature of existing office leases will likely temper upheaval in the office market.

“Those who signed 10-year leases a few years ago are legally obligated to meet the terms of those leases,” Savage, the NYU professor, said. “But this could affect expansion plans.”

Whatever happens to demand for more or less square footage, the coronavirus will likely affect the type of space people are looking for. Spaces with more private areas that might limit the spread of germs stand to become more popular, for example. And while meeting rooms will still be important, companies will likely reconsider the types of meeting rooms they want (and, by extension, question whether a meeting is necessary in person in the first place). Those new types of meeting rooms will be geared toward group projects and collaboration.

“We’re going to reevaluate face-to-face meetings: which are really important and which can be substituted,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin said. “We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships — and to create social distance without feeling awkward.”

Coworking is not doomed, but it’s destined to change

Proponents of coworking spaces have long argued that companies managing flexible office space would be able to weather a recession. That’s because, while a number of clients at coworking spaces might choose to liquidate their space completely, coworking companies expect an influx of new clients looking to downsize from traditional office space with long lease terms into so-called flexible or coworking space.

What the coworking space enthusiasts didn’t anticipate was a fear — and a legitimate safety hazard — of working in close quarters to others. Coworking companies like WeWork have already seen a rapid decrease in demand as clients with month-to-month commitments have dialed back or terminated their coworking memberships due to shelter-in-place orders during the pandemic. Experts say this setback hardly signals the end of coworking. It’s probably temporary, though it may lead to the demise of some struggling coworking companies.

“We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships”

“Before this crisis, we saw a slowdown in leasing activity to flexible space operators because the sector was starting to rationalize,” CBRE’s Whelan told Recode. “It is without a doubt that the industry is feeling pressure now, as is evidenced by the headlines around lay-offs among many of the major [coworking] brands.”

Before the Covid-19 crisis, many large companies were increasingly taking advantage of the flexible terms of coworking space rather than taking on long-term leases. That’s likely to continue, perhaps even more rapidly.

The uncertainty the coronavirus brings could cause more companies to look for flexible space that can accommodate rapid changes in their needs. Coworking spaces can also provide office environments for newly remote workers who choose to work outside the office.

“If anything, this crisis highlights why flexibility is valuable for companies,” Whelan said.

However, coworking as we know it will probably have to change to survive. Coworking spaces are known for their communal areas and shared amenities like hot desks, where anyone can use an open work station — and where it’s often unclear how recently the space has been cleaned.

“Think about the little phone booths people were starting to use for calls for privacy,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin noted. “If someone sneezed, you have a germ-filled little box.” (Months before the coronavirus outbreak, WeWork’s phone booths were already flagged as dangerous because they contained high levels of formaldehyde.)

In addition to heightened cleaning protocols, coworking spaces will have to rethink their vaunted — and highly profitable — use of communal space. Fitting as many people as possible into one location won’t be as acceptable as it used to be. Like with regular offices, keeping coworking spaces safe in a post-coronavirus world will probably lead to more dividers and private offices. That might also mean fewer chance encounters between people from different teams and companies — interactions that coworking companies say differentiate them from regular office real estate companies.

Fortunately for coworking companies, their growing base of enterprise clients had already been moving in that direction, leasing whole sections, floors, and even buildings from coworking companies.

“Pre-Covid, the trends were already tilted toward more private team space within those operations,” said Mark Gilbreath, CEO and founder of LiquidSpace, a platform for companies to get flexible office space.

“What will be most in demand will be spaces that offer a measure of control and privacy during the recovery, when there’s still uncertainty financially and from a health and safety perspective.”

So for those who do return to their office jobs following the coronavirus, the space will look different, and they’ll be functional for a different future. Hopefully, that will mean they’re safer, too.

https://www.vox.com/,"As President Donald Trump pushes for the relaxation of social distancing guidelines and the resumption of something resembling pre-coronavirus social and economic activity, his supporters on Fox News are reaching for talking points to justify this course of action. A recent appearance on Hannity by Dr. Mehmet Oz illustrated how this search has run into significant moral roadblocks.

Dr. Oz — who got his start years ago on Oprah and has lately become a ubiquitous presence on Fox News, making daily appearances in which he regularly promotes unproven, dangerous drugs — made a case on Tuesday that reopening schools is “a very appetizing opportunity,” citing a study that he claimed showed doing so would only increase coronavirus deaths by 2 to 3 percent.

“Well, first, we need our mojo back. Let’s start with things that are really critical to the nation where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble,” Dr. Oz said. “I tell you, schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3 percent, in terms of total mortality. And, you know, any life is a life lost, but to get every child back into a school where they’re safely educated, being fed and making the most out of their lives, with a theoretical risk on the backside, it might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

DR OZ: ""Schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3%, in terms of total mortality. Any, you know, any life is a life lost, but ... that might be a tradeoff some folks would consider."" pic.twitter.com/aifMeKTsIv — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

(On Thursday evening, Dr. Oz posted a video on Twitter saying that “I’ve realized my comments on risks around opening schools have confused and upset people, which was never my intention. I misspoke.)

It should be noted that Dr. Oz misinterpreted The Lancet study he mentioned. What it actually details is a finding made by UK researchers that closing schools there without any other mitigation measures (such as social distancing) would reduce baseline Covid-19 deaths there by somewhere between 2 percent and 4 percent. The study does not speak to what impact the reopening of US schools would have on the coronavirus mortality rate here, so Oz’s analysis was confused. (Ironically, The Lancet’s underlying source is the very same WHO/Imperial College model that Fox News hosts have been trashing.)

That aside, Oz’s remarks come as the most-cited models now forecast the US will experience somewhere around 60,000 Covid-19-related deaths. (The total stands at over 33,000 as of today.) A 4 percent increase of that total represents an additional 2,400 lives. So what Dr. Oz was trying to say is that the prospect of that many additional deaths in exchange for the reopening of schools “might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

While there’s no study backing up the numbers Dr. Oz threw around, the fact he was so callous about more than 62,000 lives is instructive in its own right. It points toward what a chorus of right-wing voices seem willing to sacrifice in the hope of restoring a sense of normalcy.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus”

With a tough reelection campaign on the horizon and the economy he spent so much time boasting about during his first three years in office in ruins, Trump has self-interested reasons for wanting to get kids back to school and parents back to work. But the data indicates that from a public health standpoint, doing so at this point in time would be premature.

First of all, a quick look at the data shows that the US coronavirus curve hasn’t really flattened yet. Unlike countries like South Korea or Taiwan, the number of cases here continues to increase in something approximating an exponential manner.

Second, other countries that have had far less of a problem with the coronavirus, such as Germany, have just started to consider reopening schools — and schools that have reopened in Denmark, which recently became the first European country to take that step, have done so with new, strict social distancing rules. The idea that schools in a country where the coronavirus is currently killing 2,000 people a day (or more) are ready to reopen is out of step with reality.

Trump is looking for evidence — any evidence — to back his reopening position

As callous as they may be, Oz’s comments do reflect a talking point that’s gaining steam on the right as frustration has mounted with the social distancing measures (including school closures) that most Americans have endured for the past month.

On Wednesday, for instance, host Laura Ingraham pointed out that everything we do in life comes with some degree with risk, and used that observation to suggest continued social distancing measures represent government overreach.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus,” she said, in an observation similar to the one made by Dr. Oz.

Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson’s show featured him confronting Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) about the constitutionality of stay-at-home orders and an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) in which Kennedy said, “we gotta reopen, and when we do the coronavirus is gonna spread faster.”

“You know what kills more people every year than coronavirus — a lot more? Poverty,” Carlson replied, using a false equivalency Trump has also given voice to.

Sen Kennedy: ""We've gotta reopen, and when we do the coronavirus is gonna spread faster"" pic.twitter.com/v3KsK0XPEw — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) April 16, 2020

While it’s true that we’re all going to die someday, most people would rather it not happen in the short- to medium-term future because of a communicable disease whose spread we could slow if people would just stay home for the foreseeable future. In fact, new surveys from Gallup and Pew show that more people are afraid of lifting restrictions too quickly rather than keeping them around too long. Nor do we want our neighbors or their children’s teachers to meet their demise in that way.

One person’s statistic is another person’s mother or grandmother. Sacrificing thousands of lives in a misbegotten attempt to get back to normalcy is only an “appetizing opportunity” when you assume the lives lost aren’t your own or those of the people you love.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump can’t help but sow division, even at a time when Americans are largely united in supporting stay-at-home orders and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Just after 11:21 am Eastern time on Friday, President Donald Trump posted a trio of tweets endorsing the so-called liberation of a trio of states with Democratic governors from measures they’ve taken to slow the spread of coronavirus.

These posts — which are among the most dangerous of Trump’s tenure — appear to have been inspired by a segment he saw on Fox News minutes earlier.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump began, with two further tweets saying “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd amendment. It is under siege!”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

At 11:19 — two minutes before Trump’s Minnesota tweet — Fox News ran a segment about small groups of right-wing protesters in Minnesota and Virginia who have been agitating for governors there to relax stay-at-home orders so they can resume normal shopping and traveling activities.

Watch:

Here's the Fox News segment that inspired Trump's unhinged ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA"" tweet (as @MattGertz notes it ran just two minutes before Trump's tweet was posted) pic.twitter.com/mHLxCcpoDP — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 17, 2020

Fox has extensively covered right-wing demonstrations in Michigan on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week, which echo the same theme. Early Friday afternoon, Fox News displayed chyrons promoting an anti-stay-at-home protest scheduled for later in the day in Minnesota.

Fox News is actively promoting right-wing protests against stay at home orders pic.twitter.com/50zCeQXNZL — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 17, 2020

Fox News’s coverage might give you the idea that these protesters represent the views of a significant chunk of people in their states. But polling indicates that’s not the case. For instance, a YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 61 percent of Americans think Trump should institute a nationwide stay-at-home order, compared to just 22 percent who are opposed. Along the same lines, polling from the Pew Research Central released on Thursday showed that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) noted in response to the so-called “Operation Gridlock” in her state, the sad irony is that such demonstrations could end up extending the need for stay-at-home orders by spreading the virus among protesters. But asked on Thursday if he thinks protesters in Michigan should listen to local officials like Whitmer, Trump said that such people listen to him instead.

“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me,” Trump said.

JON KARL: Shouldn't the anti-stay-at-home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities?



TRUMP: ""I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me."" pic.twitter.com/842jov2kY8 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

One shudders to contemplate what sorts of actions right-wing protesters might take if they interpret Trump’s call for them to “LIBERATE” their states seriously.

https://www.vox.com/,"Kentucky’s heavily Republican legislature voted Tuesday to require voters to show a government-issued photo ID, overriding Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto in the process.

Meanwhile, if a Kentucky voter heads to the state’s webpage hoping to learn how to obtain such an ID, they will encounter a message telling them ID-issuing offices are closed.

Strict voter ID laws are increasingly common in Republican-controlled states, and left-leaning groups like students, low-income voters, and voters of color are especially less likely to have the ID that these laws require. Although voter ID’s policy proponents often argue that the measure is necessary to combat voter fraud at the polls, such fraud is so rare that it is virtually nonexistent.

While voter ID laws, at best, are a solution in search of a problem, Kentucky’s new law could prove to be a particularly potent attack on the right to vote during a pandemic.

Voter ID laws serve no legitimate purpose

The ostensible function of a voter ID law is to prevent someone from impersonating another voter in order to cast a ballot in their name. But numerous studies and investigations show that the primary form of voter fraud addressed by these laws, impersonation fraud at the polls, is only slightly more common than unicorns.

A study by Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, who led much of the Justice Department’s voting rights work during the Obama administration, found only 35 credible allegations of in-person voter fraud among the 834 million ballots cast in the 2000-2014 elections. A Wisconsin study found just seven cases of any kind of fraud among the 3 million cast in the 2004 election — and none of these seven were the kind that could be prevented by voter ID. In 2014, Iowa’s Republican Secretary of State Matt Schultz announced the results of a two-year investigation into election misconduct within his state. He found zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls.

Notably, when the Supreme Court allowed an Indiana voter ID law to take effect in Crawford v. Marion County (2008), it was only able to identify a single case of in-person voter fraud at the polls in the preceding 140 years.

Voter ID laws target an imaginary problem, but at least some studies show that they particularly affect voters who lean Democratic. While there’s no firm research consensus on the laws’ effect, several studies have found that voter ID has no meaningful impact on voter turnout (although others have found significant effects). In a close election, though, even a small effect on turnout could matter.

At best, voter ID achieves nothing at all in an ordinary election while erecting an additional barrier to people exercising their right to vote — a barrier that disproportionately affects low-income and black and Latino Americans. Under normal circumstances, voter ID could potentially make a difference in a close election.

Voter ID could have severe consequences during a pandemic

It’s far from clear that November’s general election will be anything resembling normal.

Late last month, Gov. Beshear handed down an executive order providing that “all businesses that are not life-sustaining shall cease operations ... except as needed to conduct Minimum Basic Operations.” Among other things, the order suspends “all in-person government activities ... that are not necessary to sustain or protect life, or to supporting Life-Sustaining Businesses.”

Thus, Kentucky voters who lack an ID — perhaps because they recently moved to the state and didn’t get around to obtaining a Kentucky driver’s license before the coronavirus lockdown began — may be unable to obtain this ID in time to vote because the state offices that issue such IDs are closed. The future of life under coronavirus remains very uncertain, and it is, as yet, unclear when the country will return to anything resembling normal.

Even if Kentucky is able to relax restrictions as more testing for the virus becomes available, it may need to reimpose strict limits on businesses and government offices if an outbreak occurs. Voters may only have a limited window to acquire an ID, and that window might close just as a particular voter was preparing to obtain one.

Kentucky’s law, moreover, also resembles a similar Wisconsin law in that it requires voters to show ID in order to obtain an absentee ballot. So voters without ID cannot escape the law by voting by mail.

The new law does permit some voters to cast a ballot without showing photo ID — if they sign a sworn statement affirming that they are lawful voters and providing certain information. But this exemption from the photo ID requirement is only available to a limited group of voters, and it is far from clear that a healthy voter qualifies because they were unable to obtain an ID because government offices were shut down during a pandemic.

Although the law allows a voter to cast a ballot without showing photo ID if they were prevented from getting an ID due to “disability or illness,” the statute is not clear on whether the voter must themselves be infected by this illness in order to qualify. And voters who misuse the exemption could potentially face perjury charges.

It’s worth noting that there could potentially be a very high-profile race on Kentucky’s ballot this November. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is up for reelection, and there is some evidence that McConnell could be defeated if 2020 is a strong year for Democrats. In January, for example, one poll showed McConnell just 3 percentage points ahead of possible Democratic challenger Amy McGrath, and a second poll showed McConnell and McGrath tied.

So, while the impact of voter ID is uncertain under normal circumstances, there are good reasons to believe that such a law could have a larger effect during a pandemic. Whether that impact would be enough to skew a close election from McGrath to McConnell is also unclear.

https://www.vox.com/,"As the harms of social distancing become more and more apparent, Americans may start to wonder: Are we overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic?

A few people (although not most of the public) seem to think so. Some federal officials, from President Donald Trump to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), have asked if “the cure is proving worse than the disease itself.” Protesters in several states, including Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky, have called for lockdowns to end, arguing that the damage to the economy is too much to bear.

This is a question public health experts and officials expected from the start. As Kent State University epidemiologist Tara Smith told me, “It’s the paradox of public health: When you do it right, nothing happens.”

The problem with proper prevention, the linchpin of many public health strategies, is that there’s no clear indication when it works. There’s no public celebration when a coronavirus case or death doesn’t happen.

And in the meantime, the economic damage of closing down America is readily apparent. Some economists warn that the unemployment rate could surpass 30 percent. About 22 million have filed unemployment claims since social distancing measures took effect in March. The lines for food aid are stretching for blocks across the country. It’s now much more difficult — if not impossible — to visit family and friends and partake in many favorite hobbies and activities.

In other words, the benefits of social distancing aren’t very visible, while the pain from it is. That creates a situation in which it can be easy to take for granted that social distancing is, according to experts and models, likely preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US.

But it’s important to remind ourselves what we’re doing here. The US wants to avoid getting to the point where it’s obvious we did something wrong and need to correct course. We want to prevent what happened in Italy, Spain, or New York from happening across the country. That means reacting not just to what’s visible to us in the present, but what’s potentially in the future. Doing that will always at some level seem like an overreaction, even if it’s the right call.

“Anytime you are dealing with an outbreak, if it appears like you overreacted, then you probably did the right thing,” Krutika Kuppalli, a fellow in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity program, told me.

That’s particularly true for coronavirus. There’s still a lot we need to learn about the virus, but we do know it seems to spread at least in part through people who aren’t showing any symptoms. That means it can be spreading in communities without anyone — not even the people who are infected — knowing it. That requires taking action before the virus is clearly visible, at least without mass testing, in a community.

There’s also evidence from past outbreaks, particularly the 1918 flu pandemic, that reacting quickly and aggressively — even before a disease clearly poses a threat — is crucial both to saving lives and, in the long term, potentially keeping the economy intact.

Yes, it demands a shared sacrifice at this time. But it’s worth it. The alternative — that we let up to millions of people, including our friends, family, and peers, die — is so bad we need to do everything we can to prevent it.

The coronavirus requires what might seem like an overreaction

It’s true that we still don’t know enough about the SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. That can seem like a reason to not do much: Maybe the virus isn’t as contagious or as deadly as we think it is. Maybe it’ll die down in the summer with warmer weather. Maybe only specific segments of the general population are really vulnerable.

That’s all possible. But remember: Even if all of this and more turns out to be true in the future, the reality is we simply don’t know that now and didn’t know it before. We have to act with the best information we have. And that information suggests the coronavirus is really bad — whether it’s a huge outbreak in Wuhan, China, that forced the country to lock down, the outbreak in Italy that overwhelmed its health care system, or the outbreak in New York that has turned the US into the world’s leader in reported cases and deaths (with more than 639,000 and 30,000, respectively, as of April 16 — and both figures are likely underestimates).

We also know that the coronavirus can spread from people who don’t have symptoms yet or will never develop significant symptoms. That could mean the disease is less deadly than we think; if there are a lot more asymptomatic carriers than we realize, it could mean a way smaller fraction of the people who are infected are dying.

But it also means that the virus can spread before it’s even clearly visible in a community. That’s been particularly exacerbated by America’s poor testing capacity — a result of both poor pandemic preparedness generally and President Donald Trump’s slow reaction to the outbreak — leaving the country unable to quickly test people to see if there’s asymptomatic spread. (To this end, we actually underreacted to Covid-19, and have continued doing so by failing to scale up testing.)

“Your chance of the first case being the one that comes to your attention is very, very, very, very small,” George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the UCSF, told me. “By the time you have the first death, you have to figure that there’s been three full weeks of transmission, and there are at least several hundred cases in the population.”

So once a city, state, or country is reporting a few Covid-19 cases and especially deaths, it’s typically safe to assume there is a much bigger outbreak going on — just one that’s not fully visible, at least yet, to the public. Given that coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, it’s important for the public and officials to act quickly and preemptively to stop exponential growth.

It’s in this context that it’s so important that countries do what can feel like an overreaction. If you wait until there are already a bunch of cases or deaths in your community, it could be too late to prevent an outbreak that even extreme social distancing might be unable to get under control for weeks.

Consider the stories of California and New York. California actually reported some of the first coronavirus cases and deaths in the country — including the first case of community transmission — but now New York has 14 times the Covid-19 deaths as California. There are important differences between the states, such as New York City’s much higher population density and greater public transportation use. It’s also possible New York just got unlucky: “There’s the possibility that there were just more introductions of the virus in the East Coast, in the New York area,” Jeffrey Martin, an epidemiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told me.

But one likely contributor is that California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, reacted quicker to the outbreak. The Bay Area issued America’s first shelter-in-place order on March 16, and California issued a statewide stay-at-home order three days later — while New York didn’t until March 22. Even before the government mandates, some parts of California seemed to adopt social distancing early: Restaurant data from OpenTable suggests that seated dining on March 1 was down 2 percent in New York City, but it was down 18 percent in San Francisco. (Though it was only down by 3 percent in Los Angeles, so not every place in California acted the same.)

The extra days and weeks may not seem like that much time. But when coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, that short time span can be important. “With this virus, days, and even hours, matter,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

It could have been easy at the time to make the case that California and particularly the Bay Area were overreacting, given that the entire state had fewer than 25 deaths when it locked down. But it ultimately seems like it was the right decision.

Previous research is clear: Outbreaks require strong, early action

While there’s a lot about the coronavirus and the nature of this outbreak that we still don’t know, research from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was linked to as many as 100 million deaths globally and about 675,000 deaths in the US, provides some useful evidence for strong, early action.

A 2007 study in PNAS found that the places that took quicker action on social distancing — closing schools and banning big public gatherings — saw better outcomes:

[C]ities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (≈20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.

One example cited in the study is the difference between Philadelphia, which was slow to act, and St. Louis, which was faster. As this chart shows, St. Louis did a much better job of flattening the curve and averting excess deaths:

Another 2007 study, published in JAMA, validated the findings — showing places that acted earlier and more aggressively saved lives. But this study also demonstrated the importance of sustaining social distancing measures: When cities, including St. Louis, pulled back their measures too quickly, they saw a spike in deaths.

Here’s how that looks in chart form, with the line chart representing excess flu deaths and the black and gray bars below showing when social distancing measures were in place. The highest peak comes after social distancing measures were lifted, with the death rate falling only after they were reinstated.

This did not just happen in St. Louis. Analyzing data from 43 cities, the JAMA study found this pattern repeatedly across the country. Howard Markel, an author of the study and the director of the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine, described the results as a bunch of “double-humped epi curves” — officials instituted social distancing measures, saw flu cases fall, then pulled back the measures and saw flu cases rise again.

Notably, the second rise in deaths only appeared when cities removed social distancing measures, the JAMA study found: “Among the 43 cities, we found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect.”

While invoking social distancing is often presented as a choice between saving lives and sustaining the economy, there’s also some preliminary evidence that the early, aggressive actions help the economy in the long term as well. Dylan Matthews covered a recent study along these lines for Vox:

Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner released a working paper (not yet peer-reviewed) last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively. The three analyzed the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in the United States, as the closest (though still not identical) analogue to the current crisis. They compare cities in 1918-’19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later. Their conclusion? “We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over.”

The basic problem is that a lot of people getting sick and dying is also pretty bad for the economy — potentially worse than temporarily shutting the economy down.

The risk for us now, by believing we might be overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic, is thinking we can ease up on measures, doing it, and subsequently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths. In fact, that already appears to be happening in some parts of the world; Asian countries that initially contained the outbreak, such as South Korea and Singapore, are now reporting signs of a second wave of cases after easing some of their restrictions.

None of this completely eliminates the possibility that we are overreacting. Maybe a year or two from now we’ll realize that we didn’t have to close down certain parts of the country. Or maybe certain segments of the population could have remained at their jobs. Or maybe the warmer temperatures could slow the virus’s spread more than we think (though heat hasn’t been enough in Singapore, where it’s currently 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit). We just don’t know.

But as public health experts have told me, it’d be much better to end up second-guessing ourselves about whether we overreacted than whether we underreacted and maybe caused the deaths of millions. Because that’s the risk right now, based on the best evidence we have.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s latest spin is that while he always took the coronavirus seriously, his early efforts to respond to it were hampered by World Health Organization misinformation and a lack of warnings from American government officials. He’s rewriting history.

On Friday morning, Trump, echoing something he saw on Fox News, accused the WHO of making “several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading” in January and February.

Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

In fact, Trump was warned many times about the virus early on — both by officials from his government and from the WHO. But rather than heed those warnings, he spent January and February downplaying the threat. He told Americans they had nothing to worry about because his government had it under control. He only treated the pandemic with the seriousness it requires when it became undeniable that the country was headed into the crisis we’re now dealing with.

With a tough reelection fight looming and the economy in tatters, those facts are inconvenient for Trump. He’s now trying to prematurely move on from the coronavirus and put his slow response down the memory hole.

Trump has done the same thing he’s accusing the WHO of doing

America isn’t over the coronavirus hump yet. A record 4,591 people died from the virus in a 24-hour period ending Thursday evening. But Trump is cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the country’s lack of testing capacity to justify quickly reopening relatively unscathed parts of the country. And as he does that, he’s trying to change the topic from his administration’s performance to the WHO.

To be clear, it’s fair to criticize the WHO for a tweet it posted on January 14 citing “[p]reliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities” that found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” That turned out to be devastatingly wrong. But Trump should also look in the mirror.

On January 24, for instance, he publicly praised China’s handling of the coronavirus, saying the US “greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.” Most experts now believe the Chinese government was hiding the full extent of the outbreak.

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

And if Trump’s criticism is that the WHO spread dangerous misinformation, then he’s on thin ice there as well. The president has regularly pushed unproven and potentially lethal drugs as miracle cures. On Thursday, he posted tweets encouraging anti-stay-at-home-order protests in Minnesota and Michigan that could become vectors for spreading the virus.

While Trump is now trying to cast the WHO as a villain, the reality is that the US coronavirus response would’ve been much more effective had he actually followed some of the organization’s key recommendations about testing and social distancing. Instead, Trump sat idly by while the virus spread across the country in a mostly undetected manner in February and only embraced social distancing in mid-March, when public healths experts begin to sound the alarm about the possibility that American hospitals could be overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients like ones in China and Italy were.

This isn’t to say the WHO is blameless. The organization can also be fairly criticized for waiting until January 30 to declare coronavirus a public health emergency. But that declaration had no discernible impact on Trump, who on that very same day proclaimed that “we think we have [the coronavirus] very well under control.”

“We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully,” Trump added. “But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.”

As we know now, the virus was anything but under control in the country at that time. But Trump didn’t just ignore the WHO — he also ignored warnings coming from his own government.

Trump was warned — but didn’t listen

During his press briefing on Thursday, Trump tried to portray himself as a victim. He described himself as “angry” because “people knew [the coronavirus outbreak] was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it.”

Trump says he's angry he wasn't told there was an epidemic: ""And I was angry, because this should have been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn't want to talk about it."" pic.twitter.com/XgWWaXAWTF — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) April 16, 2020

Those comments came days after Trump tried to push back on an in-depth New York Times report about his slow coronavirus response by tweeting that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar “told me nothing” about the coronavirus until after Trump restricted travel from China — a commendable move but one that came after the virus was already spreading in the US.

The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Trump’s claim about Azar is at odds with what multiple unnamed senior administration officials told the Washington Post. From a report published on March 20:

Inside the White House, Trump’s advisers struggled to get him to take the virus seriously, according to multiple officials with knowledge of meetings among those advisers and with the president. Azar couldn’t get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18, according to two senior administration officials. When he reached Trump by phone, the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market, the senior administration officials said.

Although Trump now wants people to believe he wasn’t adequately warned, that same Post report says intelligence agencies “were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February,” with one unnamed US official telling the paper that “Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it. ... The system was blinking red.”

It’s not just that one report, either. Trump also ignored White House memos prepared in January and February by his top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, including one addressed directly to him on February 23 warning in its very first sentence that “There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.”

Not only did Trump not heed that warning, but he did the opposite by telling Americans there was nothing to worry about. For instance, on February 26 — just three days after Navarro tried to sound the alarm — Trump held a news conference in which he suggested the coronavirus would soon go away on its own in the United States.

“When you have 15 [coronavirus cases], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said. (Less than two months later, the US now has nearly 700,000 cases and more than 31,000 deaths.)

On February 27, as the US confirmed case count stood at 15, Trump went even further, claiming of the coronavirus that “one day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

He has now moved the goalposts from saying the virus will go away to insisting that if as many as 100,000 American deaths would be evidence he did a good job. He’s criticizing the WHO not because he has good-faith concerns about the organization, but because it’s a useful distraction that is being amplified by loyal media outlets like Fox News.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s not unusual for Fiona Apple fans to wait years and years for a new album from the iconoclastic singer-songwriter. The shortest gap between Apple’s record releases was three years, with 1999’s When the Pawn... following her 1996 debut Tidal. Indeed, in the 20 years between When the Pawn... and 2019, she had released just two additional albums.

But now it’s 2020, and Apple has released Fetch the Bolt Cutters, her fifth album and first in eight years, since 2012’s The Idler Wheel... (Apple loves long album titles — hence all the ellipses.) What’s most remarkable is that Bolt Cutters might be Apple’s best release in a 24-year career full of seemingly perfect albums — and that it feels eerily well-timed for an album that was actually recorded between 2015 and 2019 but which sort of feels like Apple maybe just recorded it yesterday.

Bolt Cutters is “about” a great many things (if anyone can claim any Apple album, full of eclectic influences and ideas, to be “about” any handful of things). It tackles women’s rage at the indignities we are forced to suffer under the patriarchy, Apple’s own ambivalence about entering her 40s (except maybe that ambivalence is also fueled by the patriarchy???), and the difficulty of finding lasting love at any age.

But what most resonates throughout Bolt Cutters is the feeling of being trapped somewhere, slowly unraveling, impotently furious about a world that is tearing itself apart without your consent. The album sounds like being in a car where everybody else is only too happy to be speeding toward a cliff. It’s like not being able to sleep because you’re so worried about some indefinable something.

All of which, uh, might sound familiar at the moment.

It’s been a long time since an album arrived with the level of hype Fetch the Bolt Cutters has received

Like a stereotypical woman in her 30s, I listen to very little new music. The simple reason is that, at some point in the last few years, I decided I’d had enough new music, thank you very much. But when my friend Hannah urgently sent me an emphatic message saying that I had to listen to Fetch the Bolt Cutters, well, who was I to say no?

Hannah’s urgency was matched by that of seemingly the entire internet. As I write this, the album has been out for a little over 12 hours, but it’s already generated the level of hype that albums rarely receive in the age of streaming, where picking and choosing from artist’s individual single drops carry more weight than any complete album release could. To be sure, some of the hype stems from this being Apple’s first album release in eight years. But just as much comes from how good it is.

Apple’s music has always thrived on the intimacy she fosters with the listener. Every choice she makes is designed to draw you into her world, to make you understand things her way for the length of time you’re listening to her music. Bolt Cutters takes this even further. It was recorded in Apple’s home in Los Angeles, and songs frequently have the barking of dogs faintly (or not so faintly) painting the background of the soundscape. You’re not just making sense of the world through her eyes; you’re sheltering in place with her, looking out the window at a city turned into a ghost town.

The most obvious theme many will draw from Bolt Cutters is its overlap with the rise in women being open about their experiences with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the last several years. The album’s best song, “Under the Table,” frequently turns to Apple snarling, “Kick me under the table all you want/I won’t shut up,” and it’s not hard to extrapolate this into a larger comment on women who feel as though they’ve gone unheard for too long.

Bolt Cutters keeps circling back to the idea of women drawing rage from the world and strength from each other, and their own seemingly inexhaustible stores of resilience. That gives the album the sense of a cohesive, coherent statement on the state of the world today that not only enhances the power of all of its songs in isolation, but it also creates a whole greater than the sum of its already considerable parts.

But to boil Bolt Cutters down to that single idea is to miss the richness of what Apple is trying to do. On the album’s title track, the chorus entirely consists of Apple repeating, “Fetch the bolt cutters, I’ve been in here too long.” In the context of the song, it is a general plea to stop the planet because Apple would like to exit the ride, so exhausted is she by a life filled with the petty cruelties humans inflict on each other. But in the context of a pandemic when none of us can leave our houses, it accidentally becomes so much more relevant than it might have in a timeline where we weren’t all stuck inside. (The album was originally scheduled for release in October before Apple argued to release it right now instead. Perhaps she, too, grasped just how relevant it would be.)

Perhaps Apple’s first major entry into the larger mainstream beyond fans of alternative music came in 1997, when she won an MTV Video Music Award for the now-iconic, very ’90s video for “Criminal” (still her biggest hit). Taking the stage to give a speech, she said, “Everybody that’s watching this world? This world is bullshit.” Her use of the word “bullshit” in a program that children could theoretically be watching got more attention than her ultimate message (which was about staying true to your own inner muse), but in 2020, it’s hard to say she was wrong.

I’m so mad, all of the time, and I no longer precisely know who to be mad at. The sources of the pain so many of my fellow humans are forced to suffer seem at once obvious and older than any of us who are still alive. Nothing makes sense, the world is going through the first act of several dozen post-apocalyptic movies at once, and we live in a country with a leadership that does not seem to care about anything other than consolidating power for itself. We are governed by greedy, gluttonous children who are threatened by the mere suggestion that they might be greedy, gluttonous children, and here I am, stuck inside, with no power to do anything about it. What am I going to do? Vote to incrementally dismantle the entire fucking system?

The world is bullshit. Fetch the bolt cutters. I’ve been in here too long.

Fetch the Bolt Cutters is available on all major music platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.

https://www.vox.com/,"It has been clear for some time that the coronavirus pandemic is killing black and Latino Americans at disproportionately high rates, but new data from the last few days reveals just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been for people of color.

Starting in New York City, the American epicenter of the outbreak: Black New Yorkers are dying at twice the rate of their white peers; Latinos in the city are also succumbing to the virus at a much higher rate than white or Asian New Yorkers. The same trends can be seen in infection and hospitalization rates, too.

Mother Jones compiled data from all of the states that break out their coronavirus data by race and ethnicity. The same thing we’re seeing in New York City is happening across the country: Black and Latino Americans get infected with Covid-19 at alarmingly high rates and more are dying than we would expect based on their share of the population.

A few horrifying examples from the charts you can find in the link above:

In Wisconsin, black people represent 6 percent of the population and nearly 40 percent of Covid-19 fatalities

In Louisiana, black people make up 32 percent of the state’s population but almost 60 percent of fatalities

In Kansas, 6 percent of the population is black and yet black people account for more than 30 percent of the Covid-19 deaths

The proportions can change depending on the state, but the trends are consistent anywhere you look: Compared to their share of the population, greater numbers of people of color die than their white neighbors in this pandemic.

Why is that? Well, there are the more acute reasons (black and Latino people are being put at risk more in their day-to-day lives) and then there are the structural reasons (long-standing economic and health disparities between white people and people of color).

On the first, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in NYC is a useful and disturbing example. As the New York Times reported last week, bus and subway workers have been hit hard by the coronavirus: 41 dead and more than 6,000 either diagnosed with Covid-19 or self-quarantining because they have symptoms that suggest an infection, as of April 8.

Who works for the MTA? Black people and Latinos. They account for more than 60 percent of the agency’s workforce in New York City, according to estimates from 2016.

Black people in particular are overrepresented in the MTA; they are 46 percent of the city’s transportation workers versus 24 percent of its overall population. (White people, on the other hand, make up 30 percent of local MTA employees but 43 percent of NYC residents.)

This is, again, true across cities and sectors. As Devan Hawkins wrote in the Guardian, black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be employed in the essential services that have been exempted from state stay-at-home orders, and they are more likely to work in health care and in hospitals. In America as in other countries, health care workers make up a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases.

So the steps states and cities have taken to restrict public activities and slow the spread of the coronavirus, while undoubtedly necessary and productive, have still left people of color more exposed to infection and, ultimately, death during the pandemic.

Those risks are exacerbated by long-standing health inequities in America.

As Fabiola Cineas wrote for Vox last week, black Americans have historically had higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure than white Americans — all of which make a patient more vulnerable to developing a severe case of Covid-19 and ultimately dying.

I would add that they are also more likely to be uninsured, again for both structural reasons (all the states in the Deep South except for Louisiana have refused to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts black people) and because of the immediate crisis (black people were more likely to lose their job in the recent surge in unemployment). The same is true for Latinos.

And those are the macro trends. All over the country, smaller controversies and policy choices also worsen the health of black Americans and weaken their ability to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even something as seemingly simple as clean water to wash hands can be hard to come by for people of color, as this reporting by Khushbu Shah for Vox on Detroit (with 13,000 cases and 1,000 deaths in Wayne County) reveals:

Since 2014, over 140,000 homes in Detroit have had their water service disconnected as part of a debt-payment program, according to records obtained by local news outlet the Bridge. In 2019, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31, had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report). “They put the onus on the customer to have to go in and take affirmative steps [to restore their water], so there are a lot of people who do not know, or secondly, don’t have the ability to go in and meet with someone,” says veteran civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings, who is working to restore water to the city’s most vulnerable. Her daughter, a Detroit teacher and a cancer survivor, is battling coronavirus. Community groups, in the meantime, she said, are passing around five gallons of water to residents who don’t have water for drinking, cooking, or bathing, but Jennings doubts that residents are using the scarce water they have to wash their hands. “If the primary recommendation is ‘wash your hands, continuously, wash your hands,’ and there’s no water in the house to wash your hands,” the number of cases is certain to skyrocket, Jennings says.

For decades — centuries, really — America has failed the black and brown people who call it home. Today, as the coronavirus continues to take its toll, they are stuck paying the price for that failure.

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"San Diego Comic-Con will not take place in 2020, marking the first cancellation of the event in its entire 50-year history.

Comic-Con, the largest fan convention in the US, usually takes place in late July and is an annual pilgrimage for countless fans. But any hopes the festival’s organizers had that the coronavirus pandemic would have subsided by this summer seem to have given way to caution.

In a statement published April 17, the organizers behind the annual pop culture convention announced “with deep regret that there will be no Comic-Con in 2020.” They noted that while they had hoped to delay the decision because so many fans look forward to the annual event and so many exhibitors rely on it for income, “Continuous monitoring of health advisories and recent statements by the Governor of California have made it clear that it would not be safe to move forward with plans for this year.”

Comic-Con will next return to the San Diego Convention Center in July 2021.

Anyone who’d already purchased badges for 2020 will be offered refunds, and those who had already arranged accommodations through the convention’s hotel-booking system will have their reservations automatically canceled and refunded.

San Diego Comic-Con is the latest event to be affected by an ongoing wave of cancellations and postponements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis has impacted cultural events, festivals, and industry gatherings across every sector, but the arts and entertainments sector — which relies heavily on concerts, festivals, and other public events where people gather in large groups — has been hit especially hard. Earlier this week, the Cannes Film Festival, originally tentatively delayed until summer, announced that plans for a summer event had also been placed on indefinite hold. The delays are signs that even if the pandemic subsides sooner rather than later, it may take a long, long time for the entertainment industry to recover.

Comic-Con’s cancellation is an especially severe blow to the city of San Diego, which reaps about $150 million in annual revenue from the event’s 135,000 attendees. As the pandemic continues, however, the convention center is at least being put to good use: Its famous Hall H has been converted into a homeless shelter for those seeking refuge.

https://www.vox.com/,"Welcome to the Vox Book Club’s second week of discussion on N.K. Jemisin’s The City We Became! This week, we’re tackling chapters six through 10, in which we meet Queens, spend some time with Brooklyn, and dive deep into the science fiction and fantasy community’s problem with racism.

As with last week’s discussion, there will be no spoilers for the end of the book in the main post. (Spoilers are allowed in the comments, but be sure to label them clearly to make it easier for folks who want to avoid them.) At the end we’ll provide a few discussion questions that you can use to guide your conversation, either here or in the setting of your choosing, but feel free to talk about whatever in particular piques your interest. And if you want to see me talk about The City We Became face to face (or, well … screen to screen), sign up to receive info about our live Zoom event at the end of the month. It’ll be a blast to see you — especially since we’ll be joined by N.K. Jemisin herself.

In the meantime, we’ve got avatars to analyze and Lovecraftian racism to dismantle. Let’s get to it.

Meet the avatars, continued

At last we meet Queens, avatar of my home borough! In The City We Became, she’s Padmini Prakash, the Math Queen, who loves pure theoretical math but is getting her master’s degree in financial engineering so she has a better shot of obtaining a visa after she graduates. And in the way that Bronca intuitively understands the history of what’s happening with the avatars, Padmini instinctively understands the mechanics of her powers, which work by pure math. Queens is, by some measures, the most diverse place on Earth, and Padmini is the avatar of the borough’s hardworking and ambitious immigrant class.

Like so much else in The City We Became, Padmini reads differently during a pandemic than she would if this book had come out in a different cultural moment. Queens has become the epicenter of New York City’s Covid-19 outbreak, with story after story of horror pouring out of the borough’s Elmhurst Hospital. And in some ways, that’s because of the very diversity and community that The City We Became celebrates.

Queens is a borough of immigrants who disproportionately have working-class jobs. And working-class immigrants are disproportionately less able to work from home, avoid the subway, and participate in other social distancing measures compared with their wealthier, white counterparts. They also have fewer resources to build the infrastructure a community needs to withstand a scourge like this pandemic, and are less likely to have health insurance. Meanwhile, some immigrants are avoiding getting tested for Covid-19 out of fear they’ll be deported under the Trump administration’s “public charge” policy. So right now, Queens is full of people who can’t stay inside, who can’t stay 6 feet away from each other, and who don’t have good access to health care. Queens is struggling.

But Jemisin makes a compelling case that it’s the same demographics making Queens so vulnerable to the pandemic that make it strong and vital in other times, and will enable it to recover once the virus has passed. When Queens works, it works like Padmini’s apartment building: as a place where people look out for each other, in a true and vibrant community.

This section of The City We Became also contains our first Brooklyn POV chapter, during which the avatars take shelter in her townhouse (and which comes after we’ve already spent a fair amount of time seeing Brooklyn through Manny’s eyes). Brooklyn is the only avatar whose borough name is the same as her human name, but she’s still a woman of many identities, all of which fit the shifting form of her home turf. She’s both Brooklyn Thompson, respected city councilwoman, and MC Free, one of the greatest of the early female MCs; both authentic Brooklyn kid (from before it was a borough for rich people) and comfortable new resident who owns not one but two historic brownstone townhouses. Her power comes from her music (you’d think Bronx, as the birthplace of hip-hop, would have had a claim to that superpower, but look, I’m not going to argue with the lady), and yet the Woman in White is still able to hit her where it hurts by going after her real estate.

Aislyn very much does not understand intersectionality

The Woman in White’s fight for Brooklyn is still in progress, but it looks like she’s doing much better in her attempt to talk her way into a foothold on Staten Island. That’s despite the fact that she sends a neo-Nazi into Aislyn’s house to sexually harass her: Aislyn’s disgusted by Conall, sure, but even more than she hates him, she’s afraid of and furious with the avatar for São Paulo.

Aislyn’s essentially being asked to choose between feminism and white supremacy here. As a woman, she knows about oppression: She knows about being harassed and humiliated and afraid and made to feel less than, and it’s within the realm of possibility that she’d decide to push back against her father and ally herself with other oppressed people. But as a white woman, she knows that she is offered a certain protection if she allies herself with white men instead — and she seems to be more and more prepared to do just that, to choose her father and his casual racism and misogyny over her fellow avatars.

The avatars of progressive cosmopolitanism vs. the Sad Puppies of the past

The Woman in White also continues her attempted infiltration of Bronca’s territory when she sends the “Alt Artistes” — a group of alt-right shock artists who want to protest galleries that don’t accept their work — over to the art gallery. What ensues is a critique of the history of science fiction and fantasy from Jemisin, and it’s grounded in very recent events.

The Alt Artistes show Bronca a painting titled “Dangerous Mental Machines,” after one of H.P. Lovecraft’s many disturbing racial epithets for Asian people. The painting itself appears to be dramatizing Lovecraft’s story “The Horror at Red Hook,” in which the immigrant community of Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood is a place of intrinsic squalor and evil that turns out to be a literal portal to hell. When Bronca looks at the painting, she finds herself pulled into Lovecraft’s perspective: She sees the figures looming before her as subhuman threats, horrible and monstrous and certain to destroy her. “This shows you New York as he saw it, the chickenshit little fuck,” she concludes.

Lovecraft is one of the most foundational and important writers in speculative fiction. He was also a vicious racist whose racism is inflected in almost everything he wrote, and the science fiction and fantasy community is still trying to figure out exactly how to grapple with his legacy. In some ways, The City We Became can be read as a dramatization of that struggle. The tentacled monster we saw Manny fight at the beginning of the book — the creature the Woman in White described as one of her “toeholds” — was purely Lovecraftian horror, a tentacle monster beyond human comprehension.

But as we discussed last week, the real monster in The City We Became isn’t the weird crawly thing with tentacles that heroes can pound into submission if they work hard enough. The real monster is reactionary politics, the ideas that Lovecraft brought to his work. That’s what’s hiding in the Alt Artiste painting, and that’s what really makes the Woman in White dangerous. In The City We Became, Lovecraft’s racism is what’s truly evil, while the things Lovecraft feared — the coming together of people of different races, mingling and living and working in one space — become vibrant and powerful and heroic.

The Lovecraft debate is also a microcosm of a fight that’s still alive and well in the science fiction and fantasy community, a fight that’s personal for Jemisin. Jemisin became the only person ever to win three Hugo awards in 2018, when she won her third Hugo for the third and final volume in her Broken Earth trilogy. But Jemisin’s win wasn’t guaranteed. A group of Hugo voters who referred to themselves as the Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies formed a voting bloc specifically to prevent authors from diverse backgrounds, like Jemisin, from winning Hugos, and to instead give the awards to Puppy-endorsed authors who wrote more “traditional” science fiction.

The whole thing developed into a years-long feud that involved both Breitbart and erotica writer Chuck Tingle (for a close look at the controversy, I’ll refer you to Aja Romano’s excellent Vox explainer). But the main point I want to bring home to you here is this: There are people in the science fiction and fantasy community who hate Jemisin, what she writes, and what she represents, so much so that they joined forces specifically to keep her from winning Hugo awards. And then she went on to win more Hugo awards than anyone else in history.

That’s the fight she’s referencing by bringing Lovecraft into this story. What remains to be seen is whether Jemisin’s characters will be as successful as Jemisin herself in pushing back against reactionary art.

Let’s talk!

You can use the following questions as a guide for your conversation about The City We Became here in our comments section, or in your own community. Or start off with your own questions! Whatever brings you joy. Just mark your spoilers and be nice to each other.

Pick your player, updated: Now that we’ve met all of the avatars, which is your favorite, and who has the most effective powers? Why do you think it takes so long to get into Brooklyn’s head? Does getting to know her thought process after first meeting her through Manny’s eyes change the way you think of her? I will freely admit that I do not understand theoretical math. Surely some of you smart people do. Does Padmini’s math make sense? What are her equations doing? What about Brooklyn’s rap? In your opinion, is it good enough to fight off a fleet of terrifying spider monsters? Which female MCs do you imagine MC Free being closest to, stylistically? Who’s her nearest analogue? H.P. Lovecraft: The man basically invented cosmological horror, but wow, was he also a racist. How do you square the two? Should you? (I’ve got more resources on ye olde separating-the-art-from-the-artist debate here if you want to go deeper on this one.) Manny gets a vision of the primary avatar and has a pretty romantically charged reaction. Granted, we’ve only had limited access to the primary so far, but I have to ask: Do you ship it?

https://www.vox.com/,"You could say Alison Roman has a knack for developing recipes that will break the internet.

In the fall of 2017, Roman, a food writer, released her first cookbook, Dining In: Highly Cookable Recipes, which included a recipe for chocolate chip cookies with a twist: They were chocolate chunk shortbread cookies with flaky sea salt on top. The cookie recipe was published on Eater and the New York Times and Smitten Kitchen. Soon, you could hardly scroll through your Instagram feed without seeing at least one photo of what had been dubbed #TheCookies from a friend who had made them. Bon Appétit proclaimed that “EVERYONE” was making the cookies.

About a year later, Roman hit viral success again, this time with a spiced chickpea stew with coconut and turmeric published in her column in the New York Times. Once again, the recipe went viral on Instagram and developed its own hashtag, created by fans: #TheStew.

The social media-viral recipe is a relatively new phenomenon, accelerated by the ascension of Instagram. But what is it about certain recipes that make them become so popular that people can simply refer to them as “the stew” and “the cookies” in conversation and others know immediately which recipe they’re talking about? Why did the chickpea stew, specifically, become such a sensation? What is it that made this recipe resonate with so many thousands of social media users?

I talked to Roman and other food writers and recipe developers to try to answer those questions. There’s a confluence of factors at play. Roman’s easy recipes resonate with millennials and young adults, many of whom are starting to cook at home more; some are even learning to cook for the first time. At the same time, Instagram has turned cooking into a more social experience. And the recipes this new generation of home cooks wants are simple, accessible, cheap, and restaurant-quality. These viral recipes aren’t just making a splash because they look beautiful and get likes on Instagram — they’re representative of a broader shift toward the Instagram generation spending more time cooking at home.

Home cooking is on the rise among millennials — we want good food, and we want it cheap

Millennials’ love of dining at restaurants is well-documented. But home cooking is more cost-effective than eating out, and millennials, who face mounting student loan debt, are forced to be conscious of every dollar. So when they do cook at home, they want to make the type of food they could get at a restaurant — at a much lower cost. A 2017 study found that millennials are changing grocery trends because they prefer fresher, healthier foods and love organic produce.

“I think that people are cooking more because it’s a cheaper form of entertainment almost,” Roman said. “Restaurants are expensive, especially in major cities. Every time I go out, I’m just like, holy shit! I cannot believe how expensive this is ... you’re just like, damn, for chicken and a salad and a glass of wine, I just spent $60. But what if you made that chicken at home? You could do all of that for maybe $8 a person!”

Adam Rapoport, the editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit, said his team saw this need for simple, high-quality recipes for a generation of young adults who were learning to cook for the first time. So in 2017, they launched Basically, a new vertical dedicated to easy, educational recipes, with millennials as their target audience.

“Every time I go out, I’m just like, holy shit! I cannot believe how expensive this is.”

“There’s this generation of people in their 20s who are incredibly food-knowledgeable, incredibly passionate about food, and they’re going out all the time, they’re following food Instagrammers, they’re sharing their meals on Instagram, but they might not know how to cook,” Rapoport said. “They love to eat, but they might not know how to cook — and our intention was to start a site that teaches them. Because we know they’re engaged online, we have their attention, let’s give them some skills.”

Roman has a huge following on Instagram — 182,000 followers and growing — and her simple, high-quality recipes have particularly struck a chord with this millennial, Instagram-happy generation. But her recipes also appeal to cooks of any age, which is perhaps what helps make them so popular. Sam Sifton, the editor of NYT Cooking, told me, “There is a sort of younger audience flocking to Alison, which is fantastic, and they may in fact be a little less seasoned in the kitchen.” But at the same time, he said, “My mom loves Alison, and my mom is the most experienced cook I know!”

It also happens that as millennials age, they’re staying in more — and documenting it on social media. Media brands like Forever35 and Girls’ Night In have built a social conversation around being a homebody. This is, to be fair, less of a statement about a generation than a natural byproduct of growing up. The 20-somethings who once used to Instagram their eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas at brunch are now 30-somethings — and they’re sharing the pork shoulder they slow-roasted all day or the lemon pound cake they baked. It’s no surprise that they’ve got the restaurant industry worried — restaurant sales have been declining for the past three years, and a 2017 Merrill Lynch study found that millennials were part of the cause.

Roman, who at 33 is a millennial herself, agrees: “When I was 28, I was out almost every night of the week. I was cooking at home almost never. Maybe I’m old, and now I just want to be home all the time. I think there’s a lot of reasons people choose to stay home and cook; I think it’s money, I think it’s social, I think it’s people feeling exhausted, and I think it’s fun!”

The most popular recipes are easy to cook, with accessible ingredients

“The recipes that do go viral have to be perceived as cookable,” said Rapoport. “If you look at the cookies or the stew, people see those and they think, oh, I can do that. I can cook that. … That’s imperative, that the recipe seems like something the home cook can make.”

Roman thinks that’s a big factor in why her chickpea stew was such a hit: It requires minimal prep work (chopping an onion, garlic, and some ginger). The key ingredients are two cans of chickpeas and two cans of coconut milk. It has a very short active cooking time; once the initial sautéing is done, you let it simmer for half an hour.

“I think it’s accessibility. Is this ingredient hard to find? Is this technique hard to achieve? Those are questions that I ask myself when I’m writing any recipe.” Roman said.

Samin Nosrat, a cook, writer, and teacher who wrote the popular cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat and hosts a Netflix show by the same name, told me one of her most popular recipes ever was buttermilk-marinated roast chicken, which requires only three ingredients: a whole chicken, salt, and buttermilk. It’s a three-ingredient recipe that doesn’t require any chopping, sautéing, or prep work. For people who are intimidated by the idea of roasting a chicken, it’s almost impossible to mess up.

“As a recipe writer, you have to think: What is something that is actually achievable? Or if it is more complicated, then the payoff has to be much bigger. It has to be way more attractive, or really exciting-looking,” Nosrat added.

Another key to viral success is ingredients that won’t intimidate the beginner cook. Many newer home cooks, Roman said, are nervous about meat, chicken, and fish, afraid that they’ll under- or overcook it or otherwise mess it up. She said she can tell when a recipe she’s published will not go viral.

“It’s never going to be a fish. It might be a chicken, but probably not.” Her first New York Times column featured a one-skillet chicken thigh recipe with kale, lemon, and white beans, and while some loved it, it still didn’t go viral: “It’s still not going to be as popular because you have people that are afraid to cook chicken, you have vegetarians. … You’re eliminating an audience just by sheer virtue of the fact that it’s chicken.”

“As a recipe writer, you have to think: What is something that is actually achievable?”

Not every recipe will be an internet sensation, and Roman is okay with that. Recently, she worked on a recipe for a whole fish, and she knew it wouldn’t go viral. “I’m not thinking, ‘This is going to take the internet by storm.’ This one is more of an educational thing.”

Those more advanced recipes like that whole fish (which published shortly after Roman and I spoke and, indeed, did not go Instagram-viral) are aimed at the experienced home cook who wants to learn a new skill or technique. “You’re going to have some recipes that are more of a gateway, you’re going to have some recipes that are more educational, you’re going to have recipes that are crowd-pleasers, recipes that are a bit more creative,” Roman said. “They all serve a purpose.”

Chickpeas are pretty fail-proof, though, so cooks of any skill level can try it, she said. “Even if you don’t really know how to cook, you’re probably going to have success with it because there’s nothing to under- or overcook. ... It’s a pretty safe recipe.”

Instagram and social media turned home cooking into a social experience

Modern home cooking has been, generally, a solo activity. But social media transformed it into a social experience by connecting home cooks to each other: A 2015 Google study found that 59 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds bring their smartphone or tablet with them into the kitchen when they cook. Social media helps home cooks find a community, cooking and discussing the same recipes together.

Instagram is a key place for millennials to find recipe ideas as well. The Google study also found that 31 percent of millennials say choosing what to cook was the least enjoyable part of the cooking process. If you see a recipe on Instagram because your friend was cooking it, that solves the what-to-cook dilemma for you.

Recipe writers play a role in this social media ecosystem, too, and no one is better at it than Roman. “She works relentlessly hard at her social media and is really, really good at it, and has been from day one,” said Rapoport, who worked with Roman when she was at Bon Appétit earlier in her career. “She’s really creative about how she does her social; she answers everyone who makes her dishes, she tags them. It’s a lot of hard work. … That is an integral part of who she is as a recipe developer and a writer.”

Every time Roman publishes a new recipe, she shares it in her Instagram Stories with her now-182,000 followers. When the cookies first debuted, people who made them shared their photos on Instagram, tagging Roman. She began reposting their cookie photos to her Instagram Stories and tagging the users, thus highlighting these members of her audience.

The effect was twofold: One, it rewarded her audience and made other Instagram users want to post their photos so Roman would feature them. And two, watching the nonstop parade of user-generated cookie photos in Roman’s Instagram stories made it look like everyone was making these cookies, which in turn inspired more new home cooks to try the recipe themselves. The cookies first started getting social media buzz organically, but it was Roman’s savvy use of social media that pushed the conversation even further and helped to almost create a viral cycle — it kept people talking about the recipe.

“It comes back to the inherent concept of social media; the operative word there is social. You want to be able to connect with other users,” said Rapoport. “If you’re sharing their photos and their text and giving them a shoutout, that’s going to resonate. And the more you share, the more people are going to cook, and they want to be shared. It’s that interaction which fuels her success.”

One thing that’s inevitable with internet fame is backlash: “There was some contention around the cookies,” Roman said. “People were like, is this better? Is it worth it? People were kind of mad about the cookies! So I think a lot of people made it because it was a social conversation: People wanted to weigh in on whether or not they thought it was better, and try it for themselves, go up against other cookies — it was a whole thing.”

The stew, too, became so ubiquitous that it sparked backlash: A writer at Slate questioned if it was “actually that good,” suggesting that home cooks could improve the recipe by adding their own twists, and Roman responded in her Instagram Stories. But what the backlash really did was extend the life of the social conversation around the stew: The more people hear about it, the more they want to try the recipe so they can see what the fuss is about, and weigh in themselves.

“The more you share, the more people are going to cook, and they want to be shared”

Publishers work hard to promote a recipe that starts to go viral, too: When the chickpea stew, published in the New York Times, started taking off, Sifton said his team recognized the recipe’s potential and tried to keep promoting the recipe to reach more Times readers. “You can never predict what’s going to go viral,” he told me. “We just reap the rewards of it doing so, and try as much as possible to keep it up in the air and going and in front of as many people as we can get it in front of, because it is resonating.”

Aesthetics also likely played a role in the viral success of the cookies. They’re not the easiest to make; the recipe takes more steps than your average chocolate chip cookie: chilling the dough, rolling it into a log, coating it with an egg wash and Demerara sugar. But if you’re willing to put in an afternoon of effort, it pays off — the result is a pan full of cookies that are simultaneously delicious and highly Instagrammable, studded with giant chocolate chunks and flakes of Maldon sea salt.

How millennials want to cook in 2019: simple, fast, delicious, and social

What all this boils down to: Millennials love food, but they also love staying in and want to save money, so they’re cooking more — and then they’re documenting their creations on Instagram. By sharing on social media and spreading recipes to their friends, they help get the viral snowball rolling. But ease, healthfulness, quality ingredients, and taste are still of utmost importance in a recipe, and the most viral recipes are likely to have some combination of those elements.

So what do these viral recipe trends say about how we want to cook in 2019?

“I think people are just attracted to food that tastes good and looks beautiful, and is something they can be proud of and feel good about eating,” Roman said.

“People want simple food, and they want something that makes them feel good, emotionally, like they achieved something, as well as health-wise,” said Nosrat.

“I love the fact that recipes that people actually cook are going viral, as opposed to rainbow unicorn confetti cake,” Rapoport joked. He added, “This isn’t just eye candy — this is actual food, and people are making these dishes, and I think that’s amazing.”

https://www.vox.com/,"There’s a long history of gerrymandering in this country, one that stretches back to the nation’s founding. As early as 1788, there are reports of Patrick Henry (of “Give me liberty or give me death” fame) carving up Virginia districts in an attempt to sabotage James Madison’s congressional campaign.

Playing with district lines has remained a time-honored tradition in American politics ever since. Both parties have done it, and both parties have benefited from it. But something changed in 2010.

The Republican Party, on the heels of a sweeping loss to Barack Obama in 2008, hatched a scheme it called REDMAP, short for Redistricting Majority Project. It was “the most audacious political heist of modern times,” writes David Daley, author of Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America’s Democracy, a new book about REDMAP.

The former editor of Salon, Daley is a liberal writer with obvious political leanings. Still, his approach in the book is reportorial: He talks to the Republican strategists involved in REDMAP, he interviews the wizards behind the mapping technologies, he examines publicly available documents, and he tours the districts in which the lines have been manipulated.

The story of REDMAP is surprisingly simple. In 2009, a Republican strategist named Chris Jankowski was reading a New York Times article and hit upon an insight: 2010 was more than a midterm election year; it was a census year. That meant there would be a reapportionment process during which state leaders would redesign legislative districts for the next decade. (The census is taken every 10 years.)

Recognizing the opportunity, Daley writes, Jankowski decided to “target states where the legislature is in charge of redistricting, flip as many chambers as possible, take control of the process, and redraw the lines.”

The strategy succeeded for two reasons. First, the Democrats weren’t prepared for it. Gerrymandering wasn’t new, but nothing on this scale had been attempted before. Second, the Republicans were simply better at this kind of thing. Jankowksi was a brilliant strategist with the right connections and access to new mapping technologies and databases that allowed for unprecedented targeting operations.

The results speak for themselves: Republicans gained close to 700 seats at the state level across the country — 72 more than the Democrats won in the aftermath of Watergate. More importantly, Democratic advantages in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Alabama, and Wisconsin were wiped out, leaving Republicans in charge of the redistricting process.

(For more on how gerrymandering works, including some skepticism over how important it is in determining control of the House, see Vox’s Andrew Prokop's gerrymandering card stack.)

Back in October, I spoke with Daley about his book, what he learned about the GOP’s “political heist,” and why he believes Democrats have zero chance of taking back the House until 2030.

Here’s what he told me.

Sean Illing

You start the book by recounting the jubilance of Democrats following Obama’s election in 2008. Here was this rock star Democrat who captured Republican strongholds across the country. Republican pundits were panicked. Demographic shifts, long underway, favored the Democrats.

But almost everyone missed the bigger, more consequential story: the redrawing of the American political map. What the hell happened?

David Daley

Those jubilant Democrats did not understand that the 2010 election would carry even deeper ramifications than the election of 2008. Now that doesn't seem possible when you look back at 2008. We elected the first African-American president. The Democrats took a supermajority in the Senate. They retained the House.

The more consequential election would follow in 2010, however, and a handful of savvy Republican strategists figured this out. They realized they could use the gerrymander in a completely new way. They used it to lock in political control at the state level and at the congressional level. And they did it really inexpensively, for roughly $30 million, which is the amount of money invested in REDMAP.

Sean Illing

That’s shocking when you consider it's not that uncommon for $100 million to be spent on a Senate campaign.

David Daley

Yes, the example I love is that in Connecticut, a very small state, Linda McMahon spends $100 million on two losing senate campaigns.

Sean Illing

So for $30 million, the GOP essentially secured control of the House of Representatives for at least a decade, which is when the next census would be taken?

David Daley

They also locked in all of these state legislative majorities, which I think are overlooked sometimes. For example, the conservative politics right now in North Carolina, in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Ohio, these are also a result of these maps that were drawn after the 2010 redistricting.

This is the most audacious political heist of modern times, and because it's completely legal, it happened right under our noses. The Republicans actually announced what they were going to do. Indeed, Karl Rove put it in bright neon lights in the Wall Street Journal in March 2010. He said, when you draw the lines you make the rules — and that’s what they did.

Sean Illing

In the book, you say that the groundwork was laid down in 2010 and 2011, and in 2012 the elections are held with the new lines drawn. How successful was the firewall in that initial election?

David Daley

It was a two-part plan. In 2010, they had to take control of all of the chambers. In 2011, they sat down with some of the most skilled mapmakers in the country, and they drew lines with the express intent of using redistricting as a partisan hammer to lock in control of the House for the next decade.

2012 is the first election run on these new maps. Democratic congressional candidates got 1.4 million more votes nationwide, but Republicans kept control of the House 234-201. Very rarely in our history does the party with the most votes not come away with control of the chamber.

Sean Illing

A big part of this story is the advanced analytics and mapping technologies being used, right?

David Daley

The technology has gotten so good that partisan mapmakers these days have access to volumes of census data, voting records, reams of consumer preferences, and these amazingly powerful computer programs that can just instantly calculate the likely results of moving a district line a block in any direction.

These mapmakers can calculate algorithms designed to withstand waves. And it's the data, the technology, and the ease and certainty with which they can be manipulated that makes this redistricting cycle fundamentally different from any other in the modern era.

Sean Illing

The conclusion you draw in the book is that the GOP has basically used this technology to erect a firewall against the popular will.

David Daley

When our democratic institutions cease to be responsive to the ballot box, they cease to be democratic institutions. These district lines were drawn so as to suppress the general will of voters in these states. Look, we are 40 days out from a presidential election and there is zero chance that the Democrats can take back the House. That has everything to do with the way in which voters have been strategically packed into districts.

This is something we ought to be outraged about this year. It's one of the things we've got to be talking about every single day. But we're not talking about it. We simply accept that this is politics as usual and that both parties do it.

Sean Illing

To be clear, both parties have a history of manipulating redistricting for their own advantage. How was what happened in 2010 unprecedented?

David Daley

This is not politics as usual. What happened in 2010 was different. It amounts to a firewall in the chamber of our government that is supposed to be the most directly responsive to the citizens' will. It is now completely insulated from that will.

You look at a state like Pennsylvania. Every poll right now shows Hillary Clinton up strong in Pennsylvania. They show Sen. Pat Toomey in a lot of trouble. Only one of 18 congressional seats in Pennsylvania is considered competitive, and that's an open race with a retiring Congress member.

So take a state like North Carolina, where the polls now show Hillary Clinton with a lead. They show an incumbent Republican senator behind by a couple of points. They show a Republican governor down by 8 or 9 points. There is not one congressional seat considered close.

And that’s not an accident.

Sean Illing

Who is Chris Jankowski, and why does he deserve a place on the GOP’s Mount Rushmore?

David Daley

Jankowski is an incredibly smart and sophisticated strategist, and he’s the one that engineered and executed this plan for Republicans. Jankowski is reading the New York Times one morning in 2009, and he comes across a quote about how it's a redistricting year. And because he has worked with state leaders for most of his career, he immediately sees the plan — the plan that escaped strategists and gerrymanderers from 1790 to 2000.

He had relationships with state-level operatives in every state. He knew, for example, that the Pennsylvania legislature was 102 Democrats to 101 Republicans, and that they could take control of the process by flipping a couple of seats. So he works with people in Pennsylvania to identify which local districts ought to be targeted in order to flip control of these chambers. He’s the guy who decided where to spend the money. And he did the same thing in states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and North Carolina.

He ran sophisticated focus groups and polls, trying to understand what issues might work in these states — in these tiny districts — in order to be effective and knock out these local legislators. And I think that's the key thing about this: Republicans took control of state legislative chambers so they could then fix the districts nationally.

Sean Illing

I think that's an important point because I suspect some readers may not understand why all these gains at the state level matter in terms of national politics.

David Daley

People say Obama lost 700 seats in the House of Representatives over these years. Well, yes, but he only had one horrible election in 2010. After that, the lines were changed to ensure that those seats stayed in Republican hands, despite the fact that Democratic candidates in a lot of these states got more votes.

So it's a very misleading fact that keeps being repeated when people talk about Democratic weakness at the state level. A lot of this was locked in intentionally, as a result of that one election.

Sean Illing

What is the “unholy alliance” you describe in the book between African-American leaders and Republicans? This seems to me a largely unknown part of the redistricting story.

David Daley

This is the brainchild of some of the same people who were involved in the 2010 redistricting scheme. But it dates back to the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when Newt Gingrich was ascendant.

Ben Ginsberg, a very savvy Republican attorney, came up with a plan to work with African-American groups in the South, and to use the Voting Rights Act in such a way as to create more majority-minority seats for Democrats — for African-American Democrats. But as a result, to create all of the surrounding seats for the Republicans. This is what laid the groundwork for the Republican takeover of the House in 1994.

Ginsberg, I think, was surprised to find a receptive audience among many African Americans in the South for this plan. But he did, and they worked with African-American legislators in states like North Carolina on the process of redistricting.

In the end, they created some of the biggest congressional black caucuses that we’ve seen since Reconstruction. But that came at a price for the Democratic Party. You would suddenly have a state like North Carolina, or a state like Georgia, in which Republicans took all of the surrounding districts. This was a terrific way for African Americans to increase their representation in Congress, but it had the consequence of cementing all of these Republican districts by making them whiter and ideologically monolithic.

Sean Illing

I think a question a lot of people on the left have is why didn’t the Democrats see this coming? As you said, Karl Rove announced the plan on the pages of the Wall Street Journal. So how did they miss this? How did they get blindsided?

David Daley

I'll never understand it. One, I think they believed what happened in 2008 was permanent. Two, the Democrats had their house on fire a little bit at that point in time because they were dealing with the Tea Party craze. They simply weren’t prepared for the 2010 elections.

Redistricting had always been a game of honor among thieves. The Democrats didn’t believe the Republicans would shift the paradigm so completely. They just missed it, and Jankowski made them pay.

Look, it was a catastrophic strategic failure, and it essentially ended the Obama administration's ability to do anything on domestic policy in November of 2010. It's been a six-year lame-duck session. It's been a six-year lame-duck presidency on domestic policy, largely because of this one election and the way the Democratic Party failed to see the consequences.

Sean Illing

Has “big data” destroyed our democracy?

David Daley

I don't know the answer to that. I would say that big data makes it very, very easy for determined partisans to rewrite the rules. And that we have to understand the way that all of this technology has changed the game. The media still acts as if this is just the way districts are drawn.

We have to grapple seriously with this because these districts are the building blocks of our democracy. And when these lines get perverted in such a way that they insulate politicians from the voters, and from decisions at the ballot box, we’re in a very dangerous place.

Sean Illing

So what happens in 2020? Any chance the Democrats can undo the damage?

David Daley

I think the best the Democrats can hope for is to begin to win back seats at the table. What the Republicans did so well in 2010 was they had the only seats in the room. The Democrats are not going to be in a position to force maps of their own in that way.

But if they can have one seat at the table in some of these states, they will end up with a result that is at least a little less bad. And honestly, I think that's the best they can hope for.

It is a long process. I don't think they can do all of it in 2020. And they're going to have to come back in 2030 for another piece of it, which would mean that the true cost of the 2010 election is a generation of Republican control of the House.",1
https://www.vox.com/,"Thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of Wisconsin voters may have their ballots tossed out for the most arbitrary of reasons: because the post office either did not place a postmark on their absentee ballot when it was mailed in, or because that postmark doesn’t have a date.

The reason why stretches back to a surprising decision the Supreme Court handed down the night before Wisconsin’s Tuesday primary election. That case, appropriately named Republican National Committee v. Democratic National Committee, was brought by Republicans seeking to make it harder for many absentee voters to have their ballots counted.

Democrats hoped to defend a lower court order providing that all absentee ballots would be counted, so long as they arrived at the appropriate polling place by 4 pm on April 13. Republicans, meanwhile, successfully asked the Court to impose a new limit on voters — that absentee ballots had to have been postmarked by April 7 or else they would not be counted.

The lower court judge originally extended the deadline to cast ballots because the coronavirus pandemic left many voters unable to vote in person, and forced the state to deal with an unmanageable load of absentee ballot requests.

The Supreme Court split along partisan lines in the Republican case, with all five Republican justices voting for the GOP’s position, and all four Democratic justices in dissent.

As it turns out, the post office does not place any postmark at all on some mail, such as ballots sent via metered mail. In other cases, ballots had postmarks which merely said the ballot was mailed at some point in April of 2020, without giving a specific date. In some other cases, the postmark was too illegible to determine on what date it was mailed.

These problems appear to be widespread. As of Friday, for example, the Madison city clerk said that her office received over 8,000 absentee ballots. Of these ballots, 682 have no postmark. If similar patterns occur throughout the state, that means thousands or even tens of thousands of voters could have their ballots tossed out through no fault of their own.

It’s not immediately clear what’s going to happen to at least some of the ballots. The post office appears to have used a special postmark on Election Day, which simply says “APR 2020,” and the state’s bipartisan election commission agreed to count ballots with that postmark so long as the Postal Service provides a statement that this particular postmark was only used on that one day.

Meanwhile, the parties appear to be split on whether to count ballots that arrived on Wednesday, April 8 — Democrats argue that, even if these ballots do not have a postmark, they must have been mailed by Tuesday, April 7, at the latest in order to arrive by Wednesday. But even if Democrats win this particular struggle, voters whose ballots arrive with no postmark on Thursday or later still face disenfranchisement.

Voters are losing their right to vote because the Supreme Court didn’t follow its ordinary procedures.

Underlying this entire saga is a tale of judicial arrogance by the five most powerful judges in the nation. The specific order the GOP sought from the Supreme Court is known as a “stay pending appeal,” meaning that the Supreme Court blocks a lower court order from taking effect while a full appeal of that order is winding its way through the appellate process (although, in this case, it is far from clear that there will be any further federal litigation regarding which ballots are counted).

Ordinarily, a party seeking such a stay bears a heavy burden. It is not enough for that party to show that they are likely to prevail on the merits once the case is fully litigated. Rather, they must also show that they would be irrevocably injured by the lower court order, and that the “balance of equities” weighs in favor of granting a stay.

There are several good reasons why parties requesting a stay must carry an unusually heavy burden. One of the most important reasons is that trial judges are normally intimately familiar with the record in a particular case, and they have often spent a great deal of time learning the nuances of a state’s law and how that law interacts with the facts on the ground. For that reason, they are less likely to hand down an order that has unintended consequences because they’ve had plenty of time to think about what consequences could arise from a particular order.

Appellate judges, by contrast, often parachute into a case with nothing more than a handful of briefs and a selectively culled record to inform their decision. Moreover, while appeals courts typically take months to decide cases — giving them plenty of time to become familiar with the record — judges hearing an emergency stay request only have days, or potentially even hours, to familiarize themselves with the case. So they are more likely to hand down an order that creates unintended consequences.

Appellate judges are more likely, for example, to say that all ballots must be postmarked by a certain date, without realizing that some ballots will arrive with no postmark at all.

One of the striking things about the Supreme Court’s order in Republican is that the majority opinion makes no mention of the standard that normally applies to stays pending appeal, nor does it acknowledge that lower court judges typically should be treated with a degree of deference in emergency stay proceedings.

Moreover, this disregard of the court’s ordinary procedures is not an isolated incident. As Jaime Santos, a lawyer and co-host of the popular legal podcast Strict Scrutiny, notes on Twitter, “the Supreme Court’s stay factors have devolved in politically charged cases (perhaps all cases) into simply a question of whether or not five Justices disagree with the lower court.”

Indeed, just last February, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused her colleagues of disregarding the ordinary procedures for stays pending appeal when one particular party — the Trump administration — requests such a stay. “It is hard to say what is more troubling,” Sotomayor wrote. “That the government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the Court would grant it.”

It now appears that the Republican Party may also receive the same special deference that the Roberts Court has historically given to the Trump administration.

In theory, Democrats may be able to go back to the Supreme Court and ask it to modify the Republican order to ensure that ballots cast without postmarks are still counted. Given the Supreme Court’s conduct so far in this case, however, it appears unlikely that such a request would succeed.

The most likely outcome will be that at least some Wisconsin voters will be disenfranchised due to arbitrary factors, such as whether they used stamped or metered mail.

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

Toby Ord on existential risk, Donald Trump, and thinking in probabilities

April 9, 2020 | Oxford philosopher Toby Ord spent the early part of his career spearheading the effective altruism movement, founding Giving What We Can, and focusing his attention primarily on issue areas like global public health and extreme poverty. Ord’s new book The Precipice is about something entirely different: the biggest existential risks to the future of humanity. In it, he predicts that humanity has approximately a 1 in 6 chance of going completely extinct by the end of the 21st century. The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that tail risk is real. We always knew a zoological respiratory virus could become a global pandemic. But, collectively, we didn’t want to think about it, and so we didn’t. The result is the reality we live in now.

But for all the current moment’s horror, there are worse risks than coronavirus out there. One silver lining of the current crisis might be that it gets us to take them seriously, and avert them before they become unstoppable. That’s what Ord’s book is about, and it is, in a strange way, a comfort.

This, then, is a conversation about the risks that threaten humanity’s future, and what we can do about them. It’s a conversation about thinking in probabilities, about the ethics of taking future human lives seriously, about how we weigh the risks we don’t yet understand.

Elizabeth Warren has a plan for this, too

April 6, 2020 | In January, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to release a plan for combatting coronavirus. In March, she released a second plan. Days later, with the scale of economic damage increasing, she released a third. Warren’s proposals track the spread of the virus: from a problem happening elsewhere and demanding a surge in global health resources to a pandemic happening here, demanding not just a public health response, but an all-out effort to save the US economy. Warren’s penchant for planning stands in particular stark contrast to this administration, which still has not released a clear coronavirus plan. There is no document you can download, no web site you can visit, that details our national strategy to slow the disease and rebuild the economy.

So I asked Warren to return to the show to explain what the plan should be, given the cold reality we face. We discussed what, specifically, the federal government should do; the roots of the testing debacle; her idea for mobilizing the economy around building affordable housing; why she thinks that this is exactly the right time to cancel student loan debt; why America spends so much money preparing for war and so little defending itself against pandemics and climate change; whether she thinks the Democratic primary focused on the wrong issues; and how this crisis is making a grim mockery of Ronald Reagan’s old saw about “the scariest words in the English language.”

April 2, 2020 | Why life-saving ventilators for Covid-19 patients are in short supply, and how people like Dr. Richard Boyer are trying to fix that.

What social solidarity demands of us in a pandemic

April 2, 2020 | There is no doubt that social distancing is the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But the efficacy of social distancing (or really any other public health measure) relies on something much deeper and harder to measure: social solidarity.

“Solidarity,” writes Eric Klinenberg, “motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor’s door.” Klinenberg, a sociologist by trade, is the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. His first book, Heat Wave, found that social connection was, at times, literally the difference between life and death during Chicago’s 1995 heat wave. Since then, he’s spent his career studying trends in American social life, from the rise of adults living alone to the importance of “social infrastructure” in holding together our civic bonds.

This conversation is about what happens when a country mired in a mythos of individualism collides with a pandemic that demands social solidarity and collective sacrifice. It’s about preventing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation from overwhelming the most vulnerable among us. We discuss the underlying social trends that predated coronavirus, what kind of leadership it takes to actually bring people together, the irony of asking young people and essential workers to sacrifice for the rest of us, whether there’s an opportunity to build a different kind of society in the aftermath of Covid-19, and much more.

Coronavirus has pushed US-China relations to their worst point since Mao

March 30, 2020 | The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder that the worst really can happen. Tail risk is real risk. Political leaders fumble, miscalculate, and bluster into avoidable disaster. And even as we try to deal with this catastrophe, the seeds of another are sprouting.

The US-China relationship will define geopolitics in the 21st century. If we collapse into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism, the results could be hellish. And we are, right now, collapsing into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism.

The Trump administration, and key congressional Republicans, are calling COVID-19 “the Chinese virus,” and trying to gin up tensions to distract from their domestic failures. Chinese government officials, beset by their own domestic problems, are claiming the US military brought the virus to China. The US-China relationship was in a bad way six months ago, but this is a new level of threat.

Evan Osnos covers the US-China relationship for the New Yorker, and is author of the National Book Award winner, The Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China. In this conversation, we discuss the past, present and future of the US-China relationship. What are the chances of armed conflict? What might deescalation look like? And we know what the US wants — what, in truth, does China want?

March 27, 2020 | Dr. Deepak Chopra talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how to cope with the global threat posed by coronavirus, the parallel “pandemic of panic,” and how to not be overwhelmed by fear and anxiety.

Is the cure worse than the disease?

March 26, 2020 | “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself!” That was President Donald Trump, this week, explaining why he was thinking about lifting coronavirus guidelines earlier than public-health experts recommended. The “cure,” in this case, is social distancing, and the mass economic stoppage it forces. The problem, of course, is COVID-19, and the millions of deaths it could cause.

This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously. Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

March 25, 2020 | Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how long it will take to recover from the coronavirus crisis, its impact on startups, and how the US government should and will react — including by tracking individuals via their technology and repatriating cash from tech companies like Apple. Palihapitiya says businesses should make sure they have at least 36 months worth of cash on hand to weather this recession and its slow recovery period and predicts the US will need to devote an entire year’s GDP to combat covid-19. He criticizes the corporate “shenanigans” that will make economic recovery harder says he’s done investing for at least nine months, because anyone trying to do deals now will be “decapitated.” Plus: What we can all learn right now from the histories of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, and which industries will come out of this crisis stronger than before?

An economic crisis like we’ve never seen

March 23, 2020 | “What is happening,” writes Annie Lowrey, “is a shock to the American economy more sudden and severe than anyone alive has ever experienced.”

It’s also different from what anyone alive has ever experienced. For many of us, the Great Recession is the closest analogue — but it’s not analogous at all. There, the economy’s potential was unchanged, but financial markets were in crisis. Here, we are purposefully freezing economic activity in order to slow a public health crisis. Early data suggests the economic crisis is going to far exceed any single week or quarter of the financial crisis. Multiple economists have told Ezra Klein that the nearest analogy to what we’re going through is the economy during World War II.

“I have a secret advantage when trying to understand moments of economic upheaval. I’m married to Annie Lowrey,” writes Ezra Klein. “I can give you the bio — staff writer at the Atlantic, author of Give People Money (which is proving particularly prophetic and influential right now) — but suffice to say she’s one of the clearest and most brilliant economic thinkers I know. Her viral piece on the affordability crisis is crucial for understanding what the economy really looked like before Covid-19, and she’s been doing some of the best work on the way Covid-19 will worsen the economic problems we had and create a slew of new ones. But this isn’t just a conversation about crisis. It’s also a conversation about how to respond. I wouldn’t call it hopeful — we’re not there yet. But constructive.”

March 19, 2020 | Ron Klain served as the chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. In 2014, President Barack Obama tapped him to lead the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. He successfully oversaw a hellishly complex effort preparing domestically for an outbreak and surging health resources onto another continent to contain the disease.

But Klain is quick to say that the coronavirus is a harder challenge even than Ebola. The economy is in free fall. Entire cities have been told to shelter in place. And there’s no telling how long any of this will last. In this conversation, Klain answers Ezra Klein’s questions about the disease and how to respond to it, as well as questions many of you submitted.

March 16, 2020 | Maggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for the New York Times, talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the rest of the country has bypassed Trump’s failure to lead on the coronavirus outbreak; his exposure to COVID-19 at Mar-a-Lago and refusal to self-quarantine; and the toxic cocktail of practices in his administration: Infighting, tiptoeing, and sucking up.

She also discusses CDC director Anthony Fauci’s “unimpeachable” credibility vs. President Trump’s trust problem, how Vice President Pence is doing at the helm of the coronavirus task force, and how this period could have a bigger impact on Trump’s re-election chances than previous crises. Plus: Who is actually running things at the White House right now, and can Trump operate his campaign without mass rallies?

Ron Klain: The coronavirus outbreak is just getting started in the US

March 13, 2020 | Epidemic co-host Ron Klain, who led the White House’s ebola response under President Obama, talks to Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the COVID-19 outbreak will strain America’s healthcare system; how President Trump downplayed the crisis, rattling public confidence and delaying the country’s response; and the way people who work in the gig economy — including Uber drivers and food delivery workers — will be especially hurt by the situation. He also discusses the logic behind travel bans and limits of their efficacy, why it’s impossible for the US to completely cut itself off from China, and what Trump didn’t say in his Oval Office address, but should have. Klain, an adviser and former chief of staff to Joe Biden, also talks about the ex-vice president’s surprisingly successful presidential campaign and how it’s reckoning with Biden’s history of verbal flubs.

https://www.vox.com/,"The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in China in December, has had sweeping effects in the public health, business, and travel sectors, among others. And while the repercussions for the entertainment industry may seem to pale in comparison to the clear threat the virus poses to human life, the ripple effects do have implications for the people around the world who make a living producing and distributing movies, music, and more.

The immense and lucrative Chinese film industry was hit almost immediately as movie theaters across the country were closed and major releases were delayed. Hollywood soon began to feel the effects, too, and as time passes, the impact of the coronavirus on the global film and entertainment industries will certainly grow.

Consequences of the pandemic on these industries could range from lowered attendance at film festivals and disruptions in film distribution to delayed or canceled movie releases and concert dates to curtailed on-location film shoots. Financial ramifications will likely be felt by studios, filmmakers, theater owners, and more for months or even years.

Here are the biggest and most significant developments in the entertainment industry in response to the pandemic. Most recently, San Diego Comic-Con was canceled, Disney postponed the release of Pixar’s latest film, Soul; Saturday Night Live performed an “at-home” show; and theater industry leaders announced that Broadway shows would remain closed through at least June and probably longer.

Major entertainment festival cancellations and postponements

K-pop concerts canceled, including BTS shows: On February 28, the hugely popular K-pop group BTS canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul. The shows were scheduled for April 11 and 12 and April 18 and 19 at Seoul’s Olympic Stadium. The group’s management agency said the decision was made due to the impossibility of predicting the scale of the outbreak in South Korea come April and cited the health and safety of the musicians themselves, workers, and concertgoers. Two hundred thousand fans were expected to attend.

Days earlier, BTS had asked fans to avoid a series of TV appearances scheduled to promote their newest album, Map Of The Soul: 7, which had originally been planned to include studio audiences. The group also appealed to fans via a streamed press conference. “Health is always on our minds these days, and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you’re healthy, especially since it is very risky outside these days,” one of the singers, Jimin, said. ”I hope you take care of yourself.”

The entire Korean entertainment sector has been affected by the outbreak, and K-pop has been hit particularly hard, with groups including GOT7, Winner, Sechs Kies, (G) I-DLE, and others canceling scheduled tour dates. Variety reported that box office revenue in South Korea was down 30 to 40 percent in January 2020 compared to previous years.

SXSW canceled: On March 6, the city of Austin, Texas, declared a state of disaster, requiring the cancellation of public gatherings and events for the near future. The most notable of those is the cancellation of South by Southwest, the annual music, film, TV, and technology festival that serves as a significant financial powerhouse for the city.

The announcement came after a week full of major companies — including Netflix, Apple, Amazon, WarnerMedia, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Mashable, Intel, and more — dropping out of the well-attended event, canceling panels, premieres, and other appearances. Days later, SXSW organizers announced that they had laid off one-third of the festival’s employees in what they called “a necessary, but heartbreaking, step.”

Emerald City Comic Con delayed: The organizing body behind Emerald City Comic Con, the largest convention of its kind in Seattle, Washington, announced on March 6 that it will postpone the event until sometime this summer. The event was scheduled to run from March 12 to 16.

“We did everything that we could to run the event as planned, but ultimately, we are following the guidance of the local public health officials indicating that conventions should now be postponed,” convention organizers Reedpop said in a statement published on the Emerald City Comic Con website.

Cannes Film Festival delayed: The 2020 edition of the Cannes Film Festival, arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, is still in question following an announcement from the festival’s organizers on March 19 that the gathering could be delayed until “late June or early July,” or another time. (The festival had been slated to take place May 12 to 23 and draws thousands of industries and press from around the globe each year.) The festival first issued a statement on February 28 after the first case of coronavirus in nearby Nice, France, was confirmed by the city’s mayor, saying that organizers were monitoring the situation but planned for the festival to go forward. (Cannes is a seaside resort town located on the French Riviera, about 30 km from Nice.)

Coachella delayed: Goldenvoice, the organizers of Coachella, one of the largest annual music festivals in the US, announced on March 10 that the festival would be postponed due to concerns about Covid-19. Another Goldenvoice festival, the country music-oriented Stagecoach, has also been postponed.

The Indio, California-based event was originally set to run for two weekends, April 10-12 and April 17-19, with the same talent lineups performing both weekends. It will now run from October 9-11 and October 16-18. Stagecoach 2020 has been pushed back from April to October 23-25.

Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) canceled: The 2020 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) — the single biggest trade show in the video game industry — has been canceled. The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes the event, announced that it would not go forward with the annual event due to coronavirus fears in California, where E3 takes place. The event was scheduled for June 9 to 11.

The organization said it will contact exhibitors and attendees about receiving full refunds for passes, and that it is considering ways to “coordinate an online experience” in lieu of the in-person event. It also maintains that E3 will return next year as planned.

The NBA suspended basketball games indefinitely: A player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on March 11, leading NBA officials to call off that night’s Jazz game just before tip-off. As a further precautionary measure, the league issued a statement that it would suspend the basketball season “until further notice.”

Prior to putting an early pause on the rest of the season, the NBA made other efforts to protect players and fans. The league barred media from locker rooms, and publicly considered having teams play to empty arenas, before ultimately stopping play altogether.

2020 Tokyo Olympics delayed: On March 24, following pressure from athletes and multiple nations’ Olympic committees, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be postponed, possibly until 2021; on March 30, the dates were set for July 23-August 8, 2021.

San Diego Comic-Con 2020 canceled: On April 17, the organizers of San Diego Comic-Con announced that the yearly fan convention will not go on as planned in 2020. The event will resume once again in July 2021 at the San Diego Convention Center. The cancellation marks the first time in Comic-Con’s 50-year history that the event, the largest convention of its kind in the US, will not take place.

Major film release dates postponed or canceled

Newest Pixar film delayed: On April 13, Disney announced that Pixar’s latest release, Soul, would open on November 20, 2020. The film was previously set to open on June 19.

Disney makes sweeping changes to release calendar: On April 3, Disney made huge changes to its release calendar, setting dates for movies it had previously pulled without a date and moving others. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020, while Jungle Cruise, which had been set to release that day, moved to July 30, 2021. An untitled Indiana Jones film moved from July 9, 2021, to July 29, 2022.

Changes in the MCU calendar set off a domino effect. Black Widow is newly set for November 6, 2020, while the previous release on that date, Shang-Chi, shifted to May 7, 2021. Originally, Doctor Strange 2 was set to release on that date; it’s now set to open November 5, 2021, displacing Thor: Love and Thunder until February 28, 2022. Black Panther 2 is still currently set for May 6, 2022, and Captain Marvel 2 moved from July 22 to July 8, 2022.

Disney also owns 20th Century Films and Searchlight Films, which had a number of changes. The Ryan Reynolds film Free Guy moved from July 3 to December 11, 2020. West Side Story is still set for December 18 and Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel for Christmas Day. Wes Anderson’s newest film, The French Dispatch, moved from July 24 to October 16, 2020.

Artemis Fowl, which has seen its release date pushed several times already, will be released on Disney+.

Release dates for The New Mutants and The Woman in the Window (originally slated for April 3 and May 15, respectively) have not been set yet.

Sony delays nearly all its movies until 2021: On March 30, Sony announced that nearly all of its summer tentpole films would be delayed until late 2020 or early 2021. Delayed movies include Kevin Hart’s Fatherhood, Jared Leto’s Morbius, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Uncharted, and the previously delayed Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. The only film that appeared unaffected was the Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel, which is still set for theatrical release on July 16, 2020.

Wonder Woman 1984 and In the Heights releases delayed: On March 24, Warner Bros. announced that it would delay the release of Wonder Woman 1984 from June 5 to August 14. The studio also pulled three films from its release schedule: In the Heights, an adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical originally scheduled for a June 26 release; Scoob, a Scooby-Doo animated film originally scheduled for May 15; and Malignant, a thriller from Aquaman director James Wan that had originally been scheduled for August 14. (Malignant’s move is designed to make room for Wonder Woman 1984’s release.)

NBCUniversal to release major films digitally: In an unprecedented move, NBCUniversal announced on March 16 that it would make some movies available digitally the same day they are released in movie theaters that remain open, including Trolls World Tour, which is set to hit theaters on April 10. Movies currently in theatrical release will also be available on-demand, including The Hunt, The Invisible Man, and Emma. Movies are available for a 48-hour rental period for $19.99 in the US and an equivalent price abroad.

Disney postpones major releases: On March 12, Disney confirmed that three of its biggest releases of the year — Mulan (scheduled for March 27), The New Mutants (scheduled for April 3), and Antlers (scheduled for April 17) — would be postponed. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020. The Chinese and European premieres of Mulan had previously been delayed as well.

On March 17, Disney announced the postponement of three more films: Black Widow (originally set for May 1), The Personal History of David Copperfield (May 8), and The Woman in the Window (May 15). The delays followed movie theater shutdowns in multiple states as well as country-wide shutdowns of Regal and AMC theaters.

Related Marvel delays the upcoming Black Widow solo film

No Time to Die: On February 16, MGM announced that it would cancel the Chinese premiere and publicity tour planned for the new James Bond movie, No Time To Die, which was scheduled for April. On March 4, the studio announced that it had delayed the film’s release until late November, making the film the first major tentpole release to be delayed worldwide.

Sonic the Hedgehog: On February 24, Paramount Pictures announced that it would delay the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in China, with a new release date to be determined.

Peter Rabbit 2: On March 10, Sony announced that it would push the global release of Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway from late March/early April to August.

A Quiet Place Part II: On March 12, A Quiet Place Part II director John Krasinski announced via Twitter that the movie’s planned March 19 release date would be delayed. “One of the things I’m most proud of is that people have said our movie is one you have to see all together. Well due to the ever-changing circumstances of what’s going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that,” he wrote. “As insanely excited as we are for all of you to see this movie ... I’m gonna wait to release the film till we CAN see it all together! So here’s to our group movie date! See you soon!”

Fast and Furious 9: On March 12, Universal Pictures announced that it would delay the release date of the ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise by 11 months, from May 22 to April 2, 2021.

Chinese movies scrapped theatrical release and premiere online: The biggest films of China’s year are usually scheduled to release during the Lunar New Year holiday, near the end of January, but mounting fears of the coronavirus and public reticence to be in crowded spaces caused distributors to voluntarily cancel or postpone several film releases. Huanxi, distributor of the Chinese blockbuster Lost in Russia, announced on January 22 that the film would premiere online for free. Promotional materials encouraged audiences to “stay safely at home and watch Lost in Russia with your mom.” On January 31, Enter the Fat Dragon became the second major Chinese film to premiere online, as theaters are closed by order of the government.

Film and TV productions halted, altered, or shut down

Saturday Night Live aired remotely produced content: On April 9, the producers of Saturday Night Live, which had been on hiatus since mid-March, announced that new, remotely produced material would air on NBC in the show’s usual Saturday night slot, 11:30 p.m. on April 11, including a “Weekend Update” segment.

The coronavirus has touched Saturday Night Live in at least two ways. The show’s long-time music supervisor, Hal Willner, passed away on April 7 at the age of 64; he was not formally diagnosed with the virus but had consistent symptoms. And Michael Che, one of the show’s co-head writers and co-anchor with Colin Jost of “Weekend Update,” announced via social media on April 6 that his grandmother had passed away from coronavirus complications.

The show joined other late-night comedy shows, such as NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, in creating comedy content remotely.

Eurovision canceled: On March 18, the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest announced via Twitter that the 2020 edition of the event was canceled. The event had been planned for May.

TV shows suspend production: Hundreds of shows have delayed or suspended production, including Apple’s The Morning Show and Little America; Netflix shows including Russian Doll; the CW’s Riverdale; NBC shows including the Chicago dramas and The Kelly Clarkson Show; CBS shows including the NCIS dramas, The Amazing Race, and Survivor; and many more.

Saturday Night Live also announced on March 16 that it would suspend its next three shows, the first of which was scheduled for March 28, with John Krasinski hosting. (Krasinski’s film A Quiet Place Part II, originally scheduled for release on March 19, was also delayed.)

Late-night shows suspend production or tape without a studio audience: Originally, on March 11, producers of shows including NBC’s The Tonight Show (hosted by Jimmy Fallon) and Late Night With Seth Meyers, CBS’s Late Show With Stephen Colbert, TBS’s Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Comedy Central’s Daily Show (hosted by Trevor Noah) all announced they would begin taping without a live studio audience on March 16.

A day later, NBC announced that The Tonight Show and Late Night would suspend production beginning the week of March 16; Stephen Colbert also announced that the Late Show would suspend production. All three shows were already scheduled to go into hiatus on March 23. On March 13, Jimmy Kimmel Live also suspended production.

Disney suspends live-action production: On March 13, Disney announced that production on its live-action movies would suspend production. Affected films include The Little Mermaid, a Home Alone reboot, and Peter Pan. Earlier in the day, production on Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings had been suspended due to director Destin Daniel Cretton’s decision to self-isolate upon advice of a doctor. (Marvel is owned by Disney.)

Jia Zhangke project delayed: At the Berlin Film Festival in February, famed Chinese director Jia Zhangke (Ash Is Purest White, A Touch of Sin) told Indiewire that production on his new film, which was slated to begin in April, was delayed indefinitely. Jia spoke with Indiewire at the Berlin Film Festival, where his documentary Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue premiered. But he said that before he left, he’d feared his flight to Berlin would be canceled, and that some of his collaborators chose not to make the trip. Regarding his next film, he said:

For some film companies and studios involved in pre-production, a lot of costs are going down the drain, and those that already started production have to be somehow cut short or suspended. Some of them are already in the process of distributing films and they’ve paid for a lot of promotion and PR costs. The economy is now taking a huge hit, and I think the investment side will be hugely impacted as well.

Mission: Impossible production paused: On February 26, Paramount Pictures announced that it had halted a planned three-week shoot in Venice for the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise. “Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan for our three-week shoot in Venice, the scheduled first leg of an extensive production for Mission: Impossible 7,” a Paramount spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter. “During this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves.”

Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune tape without a studio audience: Though Sony declined to comment, sources told the Hollywood Reporter on March 9 that scheduled tapings of the shows would go forward without a live studio audience. The measure was taken partly as a precaution for the health of Jeopardy host Alex Trebek, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announce they’ve contracted the virus: One of Hollywood’s biggest stars, Tom Hanks, announced that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the coronavirus while shooting Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film in Australia:

In a message posted publicly on March 11, Hanks was his typical upbeat self:

Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We’ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Entertainment venues and attractions shut down

All Disney parks shut down: On January 25, Disney shut down its Shanghai Disneyland park over fears of the coronavirus. The park is a major revenue generator, with 11.8 million guests in 2018, 50 percent from outside the Shanghai region, and an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue and $50 million in operating profit. A day after Shanghai Disneyland’s closure, Hong Kong Disneyland shut down. Both Disney parks in Japan closed on February 29 and Disney announced on March 11 that they will remain closed through at least the end of April.

Late in the day on March 12, Disneyland in California announced it would close the following day; by that evening, the company announced that all of its parks would close, including those in Florida and Disneyland Paris (where three staff had previously tested positive for coronavirus).

North American movie theaters shut down or begin “social distancing” measures: On March 13, a number of theaters and theater chains, including AMC Theatres, and the Canadian chain Cineplex, announced that they would be reducing the number of tickets sold to screenings by as much as 50 percent in order to enable patrons to sit further apart as part of “social distancing” measures.

On March 15, theaters in New York and Los Angeles were shut down by order of their respective mayors. On March 16, Regal announced it would shut down all of its 543 US theaters indefinitely; later in the day, AMC followed suit.

New York City cultural sites closed: On March 12, major cultural sites in New York City began to close, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other institutions canceled programming for the month of March, such as the New York Public Library and Carnegie Hall.

Within days, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that it anticipated staying closed through July and laying off much of its staff. On March 19, the Metropolitan Opera laid off all of its union employees, including musicians and chorus.

Broadway shows closed: On March 12, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that beginning at 5:00 pm, Broadway would be closed, part of a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. On April 8, the Broadway League announced that theaters would remain closed through June, and probably longer.

West End closes: On March 16, London’s West End shut down, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s speech urging Britons to avoid public spaces. The theaters, including the Royal Opera House, will stay closed indefinitely.

Italian cultural sites closed: In February, a number of major museums in Venice, Milan, Turin, and other northern Italian cities were closed as part of the government’s aggressive attempt to contain the virus, and annual Carnivale celebrations stopped early. By early March, with the country under complete lockdown, cultural sites across Italy were closed, including the Colosseum and Pompeii.

Chinese movie theaters shut down for months, tentatively begin to reopen, then re-close: Hoping to contain the coronavirus outbreak, on January 23 the Chinese government temporarily shut down movie theaters throughout the country until further notice. A total film production shutdown soon followed. Loss of revenue over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, during which movie theaters typically see an uptick in ticket sales, amounted to a staggering $1 billion, according to analysts.

By March 23, about 500 cinemas had reopened in China, roughly 5 percent of the cinemas in the country that were open before the outbreak. Variety reported that box office earnings remained minimal. But by March 27, they were closed again.

Chinese cultural attractions closed: Other cultural attractions and institutions in China that have been closed to the public include Tiananmen Square’s National Museum of China, the Forbidden City, and a section of the Great Wall of China located near Beijing.

https://www.vox.com/,"The number of new coronavirus tests reported each day has plateaued — a big blow to the prospects of America reopening its economy safely anytime soon, even as President Donald Trump insists the country is weeks away from doing so.

Trump announced guidelines on April 16 for states to reopen, calling for governors to ease social distancing measures, such as stay-at-home orders, as the number of new coronavirus cases begin to come down. He acknowledged a requirement for reopening the economy is that the federal government and states must know that the numbers of new coronavirus cases are actually coming down; without widespread testing, they simply can’t know what they’re dealing with and how to act.

Trump also claimed testing is “at an all-time high” and “growing at a historic rate.” But that’s false, based on the actual numbers.

According to the Covid Tracking Project, the US has averaged fewer than 150,000 tests each day so far in the week of April 13, including at both public and commercial labs. That’s an improvement from the early days of March, when the country reported new tests in the dozens and later the hundreds. But it’s not an increase from more recent weeks: In the week of April 6, the country also averaged fewer than 150,000 tests a day.

What the country needs to properly do testing, according to experts, is at least 500,000 tests a day. Some experts call for much more than that — millions or even tens of millions a day — but the general point is that the US needs to be doing multiple times the testing that it’s currently doing to be able to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts.

A recognition of that fact is perhaps the biggest reason the US is social distancing now. One of the big goals during this period is to flatten the curve — reducing the spread of the virus — as the US scales up testing and surveillance systems to let the nation and states better control new clusters of cases.

“The whole point of this social distancing is to buy us time to build up capacity to do the types of public health interventions we know work,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, told me. “If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy. And then when we lift things, we’re no better equipped than we were before.”

Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. “contact tracing”), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise. Without it, the only way to deal with the outbreak is more social distancing, which further hurts the economy, or letting the disease run its course — at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of lives.

The recent slowdown in new tests is driven by shortages in nasal swabs, personal protective equipment, reagents, test kits, and machines needed to run the specific tests required. According to David Lim at Politico, some labs also complain that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s testing criteria — which prioritizes hospitalized patients, health care workers, and those vulnerable to the virus, such as older people — is holding back potential tests, leaving existing testing capacity unused.

To fix the gaps, experts argue, the federal government needs to relax criteria for testing, invest in new supplies and labs, and better coordinate supply chains to address, among other issues, chokepoints. States, with limited resources and little control of the national supply chain, simply can’t do this all on their own.

Such fixes, however, are easier said than done. Experts warn the next phase of testing will be much more difficult than the initial phase, which largely required getting existing labs to start doing coronavirus testing — the low-hanging fruit.

“We’ve made substantial progress ramping testing this month,” Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in a tweet on April 10. “But many gains were made by getting players into fight (clinical labs, academic labs). Now we must expand lab capacity, platforms, throughput, test kits. Getting next million tests/week will be harder than getting first.”

This is one reason the plans to end social distancing are so grim: Not only do they suggest that some level of social distancing will be needed for the next year or so (until a vaccine or a similarly effective treatment is widely available) — which we don’t know if the country can sustain — but they call for a level of surveillance and testing the US simply hasn’t yet shown the ability and willingness to build and manage.

It’s possible the US could get a lucky break; there’s still a lot about the coronavirus that we don’t know, and maybe as we learn more, we’ll realize the country can be spared the worst. (That’s optimistic, given the outbreaks we’ve already seen across the globe, but it’s possible.) The Trump administration and states also still have time to ease testing criteria and scale up capacity in the coming weeks.

But unless something changes, America is simply not meeting the benchmark of aggressive testing that experts say is necessary to start to reopen the country. As eager as Trump is to get the economy going again, the US just isn’t ready to do it in a safe way yet.

https://www.vox.com/,"Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump to take action against China for its role in hiding the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. And what he chooses to do could greatly impact not only the future of the pandemic, but also the world’s most important global relationship.

Republican lawmakers want Trump to consider harsh measures against Beijing such as sanctioning Chinese leaders, opening a formal investigation into the disease’s origins, removing Chinese pharmaceutical companies from America’s supply chain, and more.

So far, Trump’s only retribution for the outbreak of over 2 million cases worldwide has been against the World Health Organization (WHO), an international body that helps countries identify and curb pandemics. On Tuesday, Trump announced he was freezing US funding for the WHO while his administration reviews how the organization handled the early signs of a health crisis out of Wuhan, China, the disease’s origination point.

But if Trump actually wanted to reprimand Beijing, what would be the best way for him to do that? To get a better sense of the options available to him, I asked 12 policy experts, including US lawmakers, former top US officials, and academics, what actions they’d recommend the president take.

Their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity, are below.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), ranking member, Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and Cybersecurity Policy

First, we need to be clear that we are talking about the Chinese government and ruling party, not the people of China. That’s important not only to prevent further escalation of the destructive anti-Asian racism we see here at home, but also to recognize Chinese doctors and nurses who were on the front lines from the start, independent Chinese journalists persecuted for their coverage, and people across China using the internet to echo Dr. Li Wenliang’s call for greater transparency, only to be silenced by censors.

We don’t know the true extent of the Chinese government’s complicity in the spread of the virus, and we may never have a full picture due to their obfuscation and control of information. We do know that they lied to their own people and the world about the details and spread of the virus, and today we face a pandemic that has left no country untouched.

We need a deliberate US effort to counter Chinese influence and manipulation of international institutions. The administration cannot complain about an increasingly assertive China in international organizations, such as the WHO, when it fails to appoint diplomats to top posts and uses its own yearly contributions as blunt instruments rather than tools to shape policies in our interests. When the United States is absent on the world stage, China is only too happy to fill the void. This endangers our health security and national security.

Looking forward, we need to make sure that the United States has a medical supply chain that is not reliant on China or other foreign suppliers. We need to restore a stronger US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presence in China, as well as an embedded US presence in the Chinese CDC and unimpeded international access to identify the origins of the coronavirus.

The United States must also lead action in the UN Security Council to ensure that in the event of a declared health emergency, all countries grant on-the-ground access to WHO officials, as well as require that all countries transparently disseminate timely public health information to the WHO and to their own people. The WHO should no longer be at the mercy of a single member-state for information that affects the security of all countries.

And we need a commission akin to the 9/11 Commission, as I have called for, that recommends further actions to ensure that the mistakes that led to this health pandemic never happen again.

Jacob Stokes, senior policy analyst in the China program, US Institute of Peace

The US response should focus on establishing the facts surrounding the virus’s origins and China’s early missteps in a credible, impartial, and scientific manner. This approach makes sense for two reasons.

The first is that, based on reliable reporting about China’s initial fumbling, the facts appear to be damning on their own. The United States should make sure that evidence of Chinese mishandling and politicization of the problem is exhaustively documented and well-understood around the world. Washington should recognize, however, that letting the facts speak for themselves will be more convincing to third parties than trying to embellish or sensationalize. The United States should show, not tell.

Second, in the contest of governance systems between liberal democracy and authoritarian capitalism, openness and transparency are advantages — the lack of which seemingly allowed the virus to take hold in the first instance. Ensuring the facts are brought to light in a credible way, in conjunction with allies and multilateral organizations, will pressure China to take responsibility. And it could result in other positive outcomes as well, such as further boosting Taiwan’s image abroad.

Next, if one of the two leading theories about the virus’s origin — that it started in a Wuhan wet market, or that it accidentally escaped a Chinese lab that was studying animal coronaviruses — turns out to be correct, then pressuring Beijing to fix disastrous regulatory and enforcement failures should obviously be a top priority. The same goes for upholding China’s commitments to international public health agreements.

The overriding goal of any response, though, should be preventing another pandemic. Policymakers should avoid creating incentives for any country, including China, to avoid reporting a potential outbreak in the future for fear of being blamed or punished. Imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or allowing victims to sue China for Covid-19-related damages could dissuade countries from sounding the alarm early next time.

I generally favor taking a tougher line toward China on a range of policy issues, from its assertive military behavior to its human rights crackdown and abusive trade practices. But there should be some issues both superpowers try to separate from geopolitical competition, even if they won’t be 100 percent successful, because those issues are fundamentally negative-sum games.

Nobody “wins” a pandemic. We should keep that in mind right now.

Michelle Murray, director of global initiatives, Bard College

First, the United States should not use China as a scapegoat for the pandemic and its failed response at home. When the Trump administration refers to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” it not only conjures up racist stereotypes that are unethical in their own right, but also serves to shift the blame for the pandemic squarely onto China.

Without a doubt, China’s failure to be transparent about the emergence of the virus in November and its failure to involve international health experts to manage the containment led the disease to spread throughout the world. It is also true, however, that the United States is the current epicenter of the pandemic in no small part because of the bungled response of the Trump administration and its failure to organize even minimal preparations.

Put simply, the blame-shifting from the Trump administration elides the fact that both China and the United States bear responsibility in creating the conditions that exist today. An important effect of this rhetoric is that it positions China as a lesser, distinctly incapable global power relative to the superior United States, which in turn, precludes the kind of international cooperation that a pandemic requires.

Second, the United States must actively seek China’s help in understanding and containing the novel coronavirus. These efforts should include the creation of an international working group to coordinate efforts to address the pandemic, whose mandate encourages the sharing of scientific expertise among states in order to guide policy.

“Nobody ‘wins’ a pandemic.” — Jacob Stokes, US Institute of Peace

As the first country to experience the pandemic, Chinese scientists have unique knowledge to contribute to such an effort and could take a leading role in shaping the global response to the disease. By designing a response that engages China on the science of the virus, the US may recognize the important role China can play in this area, while also sidestepping the many thorny political dynamics that have characterized US-China relations over the past several years.

Whatever form it takes, recognition and cooperation must be at the center of any American response to China’s role in the spread of the coronavirus. If done with care, these cooperative endeavors could provide the foundation for cooperation in other areas of US-China relations in the years to come.

Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health, Council on Foreign Relations

There is really not much the US can do. We could blame China for causing the outbreak, but the US was the origin of the 1918 Spanish flu [Editor’s note: this is still disputed] and arguably the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

We could say that China should be held accountable for the pandemic, especially given its initial mishandling of the outbreak. But our own handling of the outbreak was characterized by inaction and ineffectiveness, not to mention that in international politics, we cannot really hold a sovereign state “accountable” for a disease outbreak.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), chair, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation

China has not been a responsible international partner in the global fight against Covid-19.

China’s lack of transparency and cooperation with the global health community, including the United States, slowed down our understanding of the virus and how to contain it — putting the world at far greater risk. In the critical early stages of the virus, China refused to allow international experts to come to the epicenter of the virus and suppressed information about the severity of the virus. China is culpable for their inactions and mismanagement.

But in order for us to ultimately defeat Covid-19, it will require a coordinated global response. As one of the world’s most powerful countries, China is a critical actor in the fight against coronavirus and any future pandemic outbreak.

Moving forward, it’s incumbent that China understands the important role it plays in the global health community and acts as a responsible and transparent partner. As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, I will continue to press the global community, including China, to do everything it can to prevent another pandemic outbreak like Covid-19.

Ryan Hass, China director on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017; fellow, Brookings Institution

No one who has been closely watching the unfolding of this pandemic could conclude that it had emerged from anywhere other than China, or that China’s negligent initial response to the outbreak contributed to its spread. The world knew all of this, even before Washington and Beijing prodded each other into a counterproductive narrative war.

It’s deeply unfortunate that the world’s two most capable powers are consumed by finger-pointing and blame-shifting while the pandemic spreads, literally killing thousands and destroying economies in its wake.

The United States will not be able to protect its people until it stamps out the virus in every corner of the world. Such an outcome will not be possible unless a consortium of powers pools its capabilities to do so. It’s hard to imagine that occurring until the United States and China find a way toward even a minimal level of coordination (e.g., on vaccine trials, production, and delivery).

To keep the focus where it needs to be in the midst of this crisis — saving lives and stopping the spread of the virus — it would be helpful if both Washington and Beijing could commit now, that after the crisis has passed, they both will fully and transparently support a UN-led after-action report of Covid-19, whereby leading scientists could determine the origin of the virus, causes of its rapid spread, and lessons that must be learned to prevent a recurrence.

Jiaqi Liang, assistant professor, University of Illinois at Chicago

In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, both the US and China had moments of mismanagement. Amid the escalated feud between the two countries, we have seen the importance of their interconnection and the negative impacts of worsened US-China relations.

China has played a critical role in the global supply chain, including pharmaceutical active ingredients and personal protective equipment (PPE), which are in high demand in many countries. Also, to fight the pandemic, we need close cooperation and communication among the global scientific and public health care communities, in which China is an important actor with much-needed experiences and lessons.

Meanwhile, the widespread economic fallout in the US and Europe has taken a toll on China’s economy, even if the latter has tried to jump-start its economic activities after a months-long lockdown.

Looking ahead, the US and China should rebuild their relations through mutual understanding, continued dialogue, and long-term collaboration.

Daniel Russel, US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2013 to 2017; vice president, international security and diplomacy, Asia Society Policy Institute

Accountability is needed for China’s failure to close its “wet markets,” as it pledged to do after the SARS outbreak; its failure to inform the world promptly of the dangerous new pathogen emerging in Wuhan; and the initial cover-up that allowed the new virus to spread far beyond Wuhan and spill across international borders.

But the ability of the US to lead an appropriate response depends on Washington restoring lost credibility. So first and foremost, the US government needs to launch an effective effort to stem the outbreak in America, aid afflicted countries, lead global coordination through the G20 and the WHO, and rapidly produce a vaccine against the coronavirus.

Only then will the US have the credibility needed to hold China to account.

Maria Adele Carrai, associate research scholar, Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University

It would be an error for the US to blame China as “responsible” for the Covid-19 outbreak.

According to the International Health Regulations (2005), state parties have reporting requirements. They have to inform the WHO of all cases of human influenza caused by a new subtype in their territories within 24 hours. While China did not report immediately, and contributed to a delay in the global response, it cannot be considered the culprit in a pandemic.

The reason is that there is no proper definition of international responsibility for pandemics. In practice, no single actor has been held accountable for pandemics so far. And while the US can continue to promote reforms in China and reestablish dialogue and trust, the best response is to increase cooperation with the international community and lead the development of international health law.

Following the example of President George W. Bush’s International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, the US could also lead new forms of international cooperation to increase international coordination, transparency, and international capacity to identify and contain new pandemics.

This is not the time for the US to withdraw from international organizations. It is time to actively participate in them and reform them, filling the gaps in pandemic accountability and responsibility.

Aaron Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs, Princeton University; author, A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia

The time to press for a full accounting of Beijing’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic will be once the current crisis has begun to recede.

For the moment, without getting our hopes up, we should remain open to the possibility of cooperating with China in fighting the virus and coping with its consequences. At the same time, however, we should vigorously counter Beijing’s efforts to rewrite history and cast itself as a savior and a model rather than as the source of this catastrophe.

In the somewhat longer term, the United States and other like-minded countries should create an independent, international “truth commission” to explore the origins and unfolding of the pandemic.

Aside from whatever happens with China, the US and other democracies should work together to enhance coordination and improve cooperation on a wide range of issues, including reducing their dependence on China for the drugs, medical devices, and other equipment that will be needed to fight the next global outbreak of infectious disease.

Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan

The US should highlight China’s missteps through open sources of information, especially our media institutions and academic research. In particular, investigative journalists and academic researchers should analyze China’s official data on infections and deaths as there is likely significant underreporting.

We should highlight the institutional and regulatory failures that led to the delay in reporting and to the punishment of whistleblowers, activists, and journalists, which continues to this day. Media outlets outside of China should continue to highlight the censorship, repression, and information control that squash independent Chinese voices.

More generally, there should be a strong pushback against the official Chinese Communist Party narrative that President Xi Jinping and the party [have asserted], instead of against China’s citizens, civil society, and health care workers.

The US should reverse its decision to halt funding to the WHO. It should admit to its own mistakes from late January until early March in downplaying the severity of the virus. And it should spearhead an international effort to control the pandemic and develop a successful vaccine.

Marine Lt. Gen. Chip Gregson (Ret.), US assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2009 to 2011; senior adviser, Avascent Global Advisors

The best thing we could do in the wake of China’s past actions is to lead the international response, building networks of cooperation and sharing research, development, and logistical support to health workers.

Unfortunately, we’re forfeiting that chance by missing no opportunity to pick fights with our allies and friends. The polling on expectations overseas and even in our hemisphere that we will “do the right thing” are terrible. We compete over supplies, and in Asia we are picking counterproductive fights with South Korea and Japan over cost-sharing.

We grew to unprecedented power after World War II by helping our allies and friends, in what used to be called the “free world,” become successful. Democracy grew around the world, most notably in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, and other places. Now democracy declines across the globe, in large part because we’ve forgotten who we are.

If China emerges from the pandemic as an international leader, we have only ourselves to blame.

https://www.vox.com/,"Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump to take action against China for its role in hiding the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. And what he chooses to do could greatly impact not only the future of the pandemic, but also the world’s most important global relationship.

Republican lawmakers want Trump to consider harsh measures against Beijing such as sanctioning Chinese leaders, opening a formal investigation into the disease’s origins, removing Chinese pharmaceutical companies from America’s supply chain, and more.

So far, Trump’s only retribution for the outbreak of over 2 million cases worldwide has been against the World Health Organization (WHO), an international body that helps countries identify and curb pandemics. On Tuesday, Trump announced he was freezing US funding for the WHO while his administration reviews how the organization handled the early signs of a health crisis out of Wuhan, China, the disease’s origination point.

But if Trump actually wanted to reprimand Beijing, what would be the best way for him to do that? To get a better sense of the options available to him, I asked 12 policy experts, including US lawmakers, former top US officials, and academics, what actions they’d recommend the president take.

Their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity, are below.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), ranking member, Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and Cybersecurity Policy

First, we need to be clear that we are talking about the Chinese government and ruling party, not the people of China. That’s important not only to prevent further escalation of the destructive anti-Asian racism we see here at home, but also to recognize Chinese doctors and nurses who were on the front lines from the start, independent Chinese journalists persecuted for their coverage, and people across China using the internet to echo Dr. Li Wenliang’s call for greater transparency, only to be silenced by censors.

We don’t know the true extent of the Chinese government’s complicity in the spread of the virus, and we may never have a full picture due to their obfuscation and control of information. We do know that they lied to their own people and the world about the details and spread of the virus, and today we face a pandemic that has left no country untouched.

We need a deliberate US effort to counter Chinese influence and manipulation of international institutions. The administration cannot complain about an increasingly assertive China in international organizations, such as the WHO, when it fails to appoint diplomats to top posts and uses its own yearly contributions as blunt instruments rather than tools to shape policies in our interests. When the United States is absent on the world stage, China is only too happy to fill the void. This endangers our health security and national security.

Looking forward, we need to make sure that the United States has a medical supply chain that is not reliant on China or other foreign suppliers. We need to restore a stronger US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presence in China, as well as an embedded US presence in the Chinese CDC and unimpeded international access to identify the origins of the coronavirus.

The United States must also lead action in the UN Security Council to ensure that in the event of a declared health emergency, all countries grant on-the-ground access to WHO officials, as well as require that all countries transparently disseminate timely public health information to the WHO and to their own people. The WHO should no longer be at the mercy of a single member-state for information that affects the security of all countries.

And we need a commission akin to the 9/11 Commission, as I have called for, that recommends further actions to ensure that the mistakes that led to this health pandemic never happen again.

Jacob Stokes, senior policy analyst in the China program, US Institute of Peace

The US response should focus on establishing the facts surrounding the virus’s origins and China’s early missteps in a credible, impartial, and scientific manner. This approach makes sense for two reasons.

The first is that, based on reliable reporting about China’s initial fumbling, the facts appear to be damning on their own. The United States should make sure that evidence of Chinese mishandling and politicization of the problem is exhaustively documented and well-understood around the world. Washington should recognize, however, that letting the facts speak for themselves will be more convincing to third parties than trying to embellish or sensationalize. The United States should show, not tell.

Second, in the contest of governance systems between liberal democracy and authoritarian capitalism, openness and transparency are advantages — the lack of which seemingly allowed the virus to take hold in the first instance. Ensuring the facts are brought to light in a credible way, in conjunction with allies and multilateral organizations, will pressure China to take responsibility. And it could result in other positive outcomes as well, such as further boosting Taiwan’s image abroad.

Next, if one of the two leading theories about the virus’s origin — that it started in a Wuhan wet market, or that it accidentally escaped a Chinese lab that was studying animal coronaviruses — turns out to be correct, then pressuring Beijing to fix disastrous regulatory and enforcement failures should obviously be a top priority. The same goes for upholding China’s commitments to international public health agreements.

The overriding goal of any response, though, should be preventing another pandemic. Policymakers should avoid creating incentives for any country, including China, to avoid reporting a potential outbreak in the future for fear of being blamed or punished. Imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or allowing victims to sue China for Covid-19-related damages could dissuade countries from sounding the alarm early next time.

I generally favor taking a tougher line toward China on a range of policy issues, from its assertive military behavior to its human rights crackdown and abusive trade practices. But there should be some issues both superpowers try to separate from geopolitical competition, even if they won’t be 100 percent successful, because those issues are fundamentally negative-sum games.

Nobody “wins” a pandemic. We should keep that in mind right now.

Michelle Murray, director of global initiatives, Bard College

First, the United States should not use China as a scapegoat for the pandemic and its failed response at home. When the Trump administration refers to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” it not only conjures up racist stereotypes that are unethical in their own right, but also serves to shift the blame for the pandemic squarely onto China.

Without a doubt, China’s failure to be transparent about the emergence of the virus in November and its failure to involve international health experts to manage the containment led the disease to spread throughout the world. It is also true, however, that the United States is the current epicenter of the pandemic in no small part because of the bungled response of the Trump administration and its failure to organize even minimal preparations.

Put simply, the blame-shifting from the Trump administration elides the fact that both China and the United States bear responsibility in creating the conditions that exist today. An important effect of this rhetoric is that it positions China as a lesser, distinctly incapable global power relative to the superior United States, which in turn, precludes the kind of international cooperation that a pandemic requires.

Second, the United States must actively seek China’s help in understanding and containing the novel coronavirus. These efforts should include the creation of an international working group to coordinate efforts to address the pandemic, whose mandate encourages the sharing of scientific expertise among states in order to guide policy.

“Nobody ‘wins’ a pandemic.” — Jacob Stokes, US Institute of Peace

As the first country to experience the pandemic, Chinese scientists have unique knowledge to contribute to such an effort and could take a leading role in shaping the global response to the disease. By designing a response that engages China on the science of the virus, the US may recognize the important role China can play in this area, while also sidestepping the many thorny political dynamics that have characterized US-China relations over the past several years.

Whatever form it takes, recognition and cooperation must be at the center of any American response to China’s role in the spread of the coronavirus. If done with care, these cooperative endeavors could provide the foundation for cooperation in other areas of US-China relations in the years to come.

Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health, Council on Foreign Relations

There is really not much the US can do. We could blame China for causing the outbreak, but the US was the origin of the 1918 Spanish flu [Editor’s note: this is still disputed] and arguably the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

We could say that China should be held accountable for the pandemic, especially given its initial mishandling of the outbreak. But our own handling of the outbreak was characterized by inaction and ineffectiveness, not to mention that in international politics, we cannot really hold a sovereign state “accountable” for a disease outbreak.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), chair, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation

China has not been a responsible international partner in the global fight against Covid-19.

China’s lack of transparency and cooperation with the global health community, including the United States, slowed down our understanding of the virus and how to contain it — putting the world at far greater risk. In the critical early stages of the virus, China refused to allow international experts to come to the epicenter of the virus and suppressed information about the severity of the virus. China is culpable for their inactions and mismanagement.

But in order for us to ultimately defeat Covid-19, it will require a coordinated global response. As one of the world’s most powerful countries, China is a critical actor in the fight against coronavirus and any future pandemic outbreak.

Moving forward, it’s incumbent that China understands the important role it plays in the global health community and acts as a responsible and transparent partner. As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, I will continue to press the global community, including China, to do everything it can to prevent another pandemic outbreak like Covid-19.

Ryan Hass, China director on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017; fellow, Brookings Institution

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s not unusual for Fiona Apple fans to wait years and years for a new album from the iconoclastic singer-songwriter. The shortest gap between Apple’s record releases was three years, with 1999’s When the Pawn... following her 1996 debut Tidal. Indeed, in the 20 years between When the Pawn... and 2019, she had released just two additional albums.

But now it’s 2020, and Apple has released Fetch the Bolt Cutters, her fifth album and first in eight years, since 2012’s The Idler Wheel... (Apple loves long album titles — hence all the ellipses.) What’s most remarkable is that Bolt Cutters might be Apple’s best release in a 24-year career full of seemingly perfect albums — and that it feels eerily well-timed for an album that was actually recorded between 2015 and 2019 but which sort of feels like Apple maybe just recorded it yesterday.

Bolt Cutters is “about” a great many things (if anyone can claim any Apple album, full of eclectic influences and ideas, to be “about” any handful of things). It tackles women’s rage at the indignities we are forced to suffer under the patriarchy, Apple’s own ambivalence about entering her 40s (except maybe that ambivalence is also fueled by the patriarchy???), and the difficulty of finding lasting love at any age.

But what most resonates throughout Bolt Cutters is the feeling of being trapped somewhere, slowly unraveling, impotently furious about a world that is tearing itself apart without your consent. The album sounds like being in a car where everybody else is only too happy to be speeding toward a cliff. It’s like not being able to sleep because you’re so worried about some indefinable something.

All of which, uh, might sound familiar at the moment.

It’s been a long time since an album arrived with the level of hype Fetch the Bolt Cutters has received

Like a stereotypical woman in her 30s, I listen to very little new music. The simple reason is that, at some point in the last few years, I decided I’d had enough new music, thank you very much. But when my friend Hannah urgently sent me an emphatic message saying that I had to listen to Fetch the Bolt Cutters, well, who was I to say no?

Hannah’s urgency was matched by that of seemingly the entire internet. As I write this, the album has been out for a little over 12 hours, but it’s already generated the level of hype that albums rarely receive in the age of streaming, where picking and choosing from artist’s individual single drops carry more weight than any complete album release could. To be sure, some of the hype stems from this being Apple’s first album release in eight years. But just as much comes from how good it is.

Apple’s music has always thrived on the intimacy she fosters with the listener. Every choice she makes is designed to draw you into her world, to make you understand things her way for the length of time you’re listening to her music. Bolt Cutters takes this even further. It was recorded in Apple’s home in Los Angeles, and songs frequently have the barking of dogs faintly (or not so faintly) painting the background of the soundscape. You’re not just making sense of the world through her eyes; you’re sheltering in place with her, looking out the window at a city turned into a ghost town.

The most obvious theme many will draw from Bolt Cutters is its overlap with the rise in women being open about their experiences with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the last several years. The album’s best song, “Under the Table,” frequently turns to Apple snarling, “Kick me under the table all you want/I won’t shut up,” and it’s not hard to extrapolate this into a larger comment on women who feel as though they’ve gone unheard for too long.

Bolt Cutters keeps circling back to the idea of women drawing rage from the world and strength from each other, and their own seemingly inexhaustible stores of resilience. That gives the album the sense of a cohesive, coherent statement on the state of the world today that not only enhances the power of all of its songs in isolation, but it also creates a whole greater than the sum of its already considerable parts.

But to boil Bolt Cutters down to that single idea is to miss the richness of what Apple is trying to do. On the album’s title track, the chorus entirely consists of Apple repeating, “Fetch the bolt cutters, I’ve been in here too long.” In the context of the song, it is a general plea to stop the planet because Apple would like to exit the ride, so exhausted is she by a life filled with the petty cruelties humans inflict on each other. But in the context of a pandemic when none of us can leave our houses, it accidentally becomes so much more relevant than it might have in a timeline where we weren’t all stuck inside. (The album was originally scheduled for release in October before Apple argued to release it right now instead. Perhaps she, too, grasped just how relevant it would be.)

Perhaps Apple’s first major entry into the larger mainstream beyond fans of alternative music came in 1997, when she won an MTV Video Music Award for the now-iconic, very ’90s video for “Criminal” (still her biggest hit). Taking the stage to give a speech, she said, “Everybody that’s watching this world? This world is bullshit.” Her use of the word “bullshit” in a program that children could theoretically be watching got more attention than her ultimate message (which was about staying true to your own inner muse), but in 2020, it’s hard to say she was wrong.

I’m so mad, all of the time, and I no longer precisely know who to be mad at. The sources of the pain so many of my fellow humans are forced to suffer seem at once obvious and older than any of us who are still alive. Nothing makes sense, the world is going through the first act of several dozen post-apocalyptic movies at once, and we live in a country with a leadership that does not seem to care about anything other than consolidating power for itself. We are governed by greedy, gluttonous children who are threatened by the mere suggestion that they might be greedy, gluttonous children, and here I am, stuck inside, with no power to do anything about it. What am I going to do? Vote to incrementally dismantle the entire fucking system?

The world is bullshit. Fetch the bolt cutters. I’ve been in here too long.

Fetch the Bolt Cutters is available on all major music platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.

https://www.vox.com/,"San Diego Comic-Con will not take place in 2020, marking the first cancellation of the event in its entire 50-year history.

Comic-Con, the largest fan convention in the US, usually takes place in late July and is an annual pilgrimage for countless fans. But any hopes the festival’s organizers had that the coronavirus pandemic would have subsided by this summer seem to have given way to caution.

In a statement published April 17, the organizers behind the annual pop culture convention announced “with deep regret that there will be no Comic-Con in 2020.” They noted that while they had hoped to delay the decision because so many fans look forward to the annual event and so many exhibitors rely on it for income, “Continuous monitoring of health advisories and recent statements by the Governor of California have made it clear that it would not be safe to move forward with plans for this year.”

Comic-Con will next return to the San Diego Convention Center in July 2021.

Anyone who’d already purchased badges for 2020 will be offered refunds, and those who had already arranged accommodations through the convention’s hotel-booking system will have their reservations automatically canceled and refunded.

San Diego Comic-Con is the latest event to be affected by an ongoing wave of cancellations and postponements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis has impacted cultural events, festivals, and industry gatherings across every sector, but the arts and entertainments sector — which relies heavily on concerts, festivals, and other public events where people gather in large groups — has been hit especially hard. Earlier this week, the Cannes Film Festival, originally tentatively delayed until summer, announced that plans for a summer event had also been placed on indefinite hold. The delays are signs that even if the pandemic subsides sooner rather than later, it may take a long, long time for the entertainment industry to recover.

Comic-Con’s cancellation is an especially severe blow to the city of San Diego, which reaps about $150 million in annual revenue from the event’s 135,000 attendees. As the pandemic continues, however, the convention center is at least being put to good use: Its famous Hall H has been converted into a homeless shelter for those seeking refuge.

https://www.vox.com/,"The number of new coronavirus tests reported each day has plateaued — a big blow to the prospects of America reopening its economy safely anytime soon, even as President Donald Trump insists the country is weeks away from doing so.

Trump announced guidelines on April 16 for states to reopen, calling for governors to ease social distancing measures, such as stay-at-home orders, as the number of new coronavirus cases begin to come down. He acknowledged a requirement for reopening the economy is that the federal government and states must know that the numbers of new coronavirus cases are actually coming down; without widespread testing, they simply can’t know what they’re dealing with and how to act.

Trump also claimed testing is “at an all-time high” and “growing at a historic rate.” But that’s false, based on the actual numbers.

According to the Covid Tracking Project, the US has averaged fewer than 150,000 tests each day so far in the week of April 13, including at both public and commercial labs. That’s an improvement from the early days of March, when the country reported new tests in the dozens and later the hundreds. But it’s not an increase from more recent weeks: In the week of April 6, the country also averaged fewer than 150,000 tests a day.

What the country needs to properly do testing, according to experts, is at least 500,000 tests a day. Some experts call for much more than that — millions or even tens of millions a day — but the general point is that the US needs to be doing multiple times the testing that it’s currently doing to be able to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts.

A recognition of that fact is perhaps the biggest reason the US is social distancing now. One of the big goals during this period is to flatten the curve — reducing the spread of the virus — as the US scales up testing and surveillance systems to let the nation and states better control new clusters of cases.

“The whole point of this social distancing is to buy us time to build up capacity to do the types of public health interventions we know work,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, told me. “If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy. And then when we lift things, we’re no better equipped than we were before.”

Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. “contact tracing”), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise. Without it, the only way to deal with the outbreak is more social distancing, which further hurts the economy, or letting the disease run its course — at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of lives.

The recent slowdown in new tests is driven by shortages in nasal swabs, personal protective equipment, reagents, test kits, and machines needed to run the specific tests required. According to David Lim at Politico, some labs also complain that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s testing criteria — which prioritizes hospitalized patients, health care workers, and those vulnerable to the virus, such as older people — is holding back potential tests, leaving existing testing capacity unused.

To fix the gaps, experts argue, the federal government needs to relax criteria for testing, invest in new supplies and labs, and better coordinate supply chains to address, among other issues, chokepoints. States, with limited resources and little control of the national supply chain, simply can’t do this all on their own.

Such fixes, however, are easier said than done. Experts warn the next phase of testing will be much more difficult than the initial phase, which largely required getting existing labs to start doing coronavirus testing — the low-hanging fruit.

“We’ve made substantial progress ramping testing this month,” Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in a tweet on April 10. “But many gains were made by getting players into fight (clinical labs, academic labs). Now we must expand lab capacity, platforms, throughput, test kits. Getting next million tests/week will be harder than getting first.”

This is one reason the plans to end social distancing are so grim: Not only do they suggest that some level of social distancing will be needed for the next year or so (until a vaccine or a similarly effective treatment is widely available) — which we don’t know if the country can sustain — but they call for a level of surveillance and testing the US simply hasn’t yet shown the ability and willingness to build and manage.

It’s possible the US could get a lucky break; there’s still a lot about the coronavirus that we don’t know, and maybe as we learn more, we’ll realize the country can be spared the worst. (That’s optimistic, given the outbreaks we’ve already seen across the globe, but it’s possible.) The Trump administration and states also still have time to ease testing criteria and scale up capacity in the coming weeks.

But unless something changes, America is simply not meeting the benchmark of aggressive testing that experts say is necessary to start to reopen the country. As eager as Trump is to get the economy going again, the US just isn’t ready to do it in a safe way yet.

https://www.vox.com/,"The United States has the most confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world, with nearly eight times the number of cases reported in China and more than three times as many cases as Italy and Spain, other epicenters of this global outbreak. Confirmed infections in the US make up nearly a third of the world’s coronavirus cases.

America started off testing people for the coronavirus at a slower rate than most other developed countries, but the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US has risen more quickly than the country’s peers abroad. We don’t yet know the full extent of the outbreak, but America remains a focal point of the coronavirus pandemic.

The US health system was less prepared for a pandemic than those of other wealthy nations. A high uninsured rate, high out-of-pocket health care costs, and low medical system capacity combined to make the country more vulnerable to a pathogen before the coronavirus ever came to our shores. America’s lax response in the early days of the outbreak only compounded those structural problems.

“Everyone working in this space would agree that no matter how you measure it, the US is far behind on this,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox in mid-March of the initial coronavirus response.

Here’s how the number of confirmed cases in the US compares to select other countries, based on days since each country reached 100 confirmed cases, according to data we analyzed from the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard.

Note that the chart uses a log scale, meaning that the Y-axis goes up in equal distances between 100, 1,000, and 10,000 to mimic the exponential rate at which a contagion like the coronavirus spreads.

Here’s that same chart on a traditional linear scale.

As of April 16, the Johns Hopkins research data shows more than 2 million confirmed cases worldwide, about 640,000 of which were in the US. The actual number of cases is likely much higher. About 140,000 people have died across the world from Covid-19, including nearly 30,000 in the United States. There are signs that social distancing measures in the US are making an impact, but the country surpassed Iran, Italy, and China to have the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.

As the Wall Street Journal has reported, Chinese health officials recently acknowledged they did not include 1,500 asymptomatic cases in their previous national tallies, but said that such cases would be counted starting on April 1. Based on reporting by the South China Morning Post, China may be undercounting asymptomatic cases to an even greater degree. But remember, most countries’ numbers are probably low because people who have no or mild symptoms generally don’t get tested.

Case numbers in the US have also far outpaced places like South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, where the governments mobilized more quickly and certain cultural norms (like mask-wearing) may have helped slow the spread. (Early signs of a second wave of cases have recently appeared in Singapore, however; this was a fear among public health experts who worried societies would be too quick to reopen.)

Japan’s case numbers also appear to be low, though they have risen in recent weeks, and the government has been criticized over not having enough tests to properly judge the number of cases. On the other hand, the number of deaths in Japan is small compared to the hardest-hit countries, suggesting better containment than in some European nations or the US.

As America implements dramatic measures to control the spread of Covid-19, with schools and businesses closing and general social distancing underway, the country is still struggling to understand the full scope of the outbreak because of the slow start of testing. It has undeniably hindered the US response.

“The testing failure is putting additional strain on our already challenged health system,” Cynthia Cox, director of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, said. “The combination of all of these factors will make the US worse off than similar countries.”

Testing is not only important because it gets people diagnosed and appropriate treatment if they do have an infection; it also establishes how widespread a virus actually is. Experts know the size of the problem, they know the rate at which people are being hospitalized or dying, and they can follow its movements.

But the United States has faltered in rolling out coronavirus tests, putting America far behind its economic peers in tracing the outbreak. A manufacturing problem with the test kits that were initially sent out in the field, and a delay in approving commercial tests, set the nation back in stopping or slowing down Covid-19.

Even as testing capacity has ramped up in the US, as of April 16, America is still lagging behind other places in the world hit hardest by the virus in the share of its population being tested. The US has tested about half as many people per million residents as Italy, a focal point of Europe’s outbreak, and Germany, considered a model of rapid and widespread testing.

There have been more than 3.2 million tests conducted in the US for its population of 329 million, but the number of tests per capita conducted varies greatly by state.

The US has finally started to catch up to the rest of the developed world in responding to Covid-19. But as case numbers and deaths continue to increase, we’re still learning the full scope of the crisis.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s latest spin is that while he always took the coronavirus seriously, his early efforts to respond to it were hampered by World Health Organization misinformation and a lack of warnings from American government officials. He’s rewriting history.

On Friday morning, Trump, echoing something he saw on Fox News, accused the WHO of making “several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading” in January and February.

Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

In fact, Trump was warned many times about the virus early on — both by officials from his government and from the WHO. But rather than heed those warnings, he spent January and February downplaying the threat. He told Americans they had nothing to worry about because his government had it under control. He only treated the pandemic with the seriousness it requires when it became undeniable that the country was headed into the crisis we’re now dealing with.

With a tough reelection fight looming and the economy in tatters, those facts are inconvenient for Trump. He’s now trying to prematurely move on from the coronavirus and put his slow response down the memory hole.

Trump has done the same thing he’s accusing the WHO of doing

America isn’t over the coronavirus hump yet. A record 4,591 people died from the virus in a 24-hour period ending Thursday evening. But Trump is cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the country’s lack of testing capacity to justify quickly reopening relatively unscathed parts of the country. And as he does that, he’s trying to change the topic from his administration’s performance to the WHO.

To be clear, it’s fair to criticize the WHO for a tweet it posted on January 14 citing “[p]reliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities” that found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” That turned out to be devastatingly wrong. But Trump should also look in the mirror.

On January 24, for instance, he publicly praised China’s handling of the coronavirus, saying the US “greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.” Most experts now believe the Chinese government was hiding the full extent of the outbreak.

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

And if Trump’s criticism is that the WHO spread dangerous misinformation, then he’s on thin ice there as well. The president has regularly pushed unproven and potentially lethal drugs as miracle cures. On Thursday, he posted tweets encouraging anti-stay-at-home-order protests in Minnesota and Michigan that could become vectors for spreading the virus.

Almost no masks and no regard for social distancing guidelines outside of the Governor’s Residence. @MPRnews pic.twitter.com/8aMLHSHYzA — Evan Frost (@efrostee) April 17, 2020

While Trump is now trying to cast the WHO as a villain, the reality is that the US coronavirus response would’ve been much more effective had he actually followed some of the organization’s key recommendations about testing and social distancing. Instead, Trump sat idly by while the virus spread across the country in a mostly undetected manner in February and only embraced social distancing in mid-March, when public healths experts begin to sound the alarm about the possibility that American hospitals could be overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients like ones in China and Italy were.

This isn’t to say the WHO is blameless. The organization can also be fairly criticized for waiting until January 30 to declare coronavirus a public health emergency. But that declaration had no discernible impact on Trump, who on that very same day proclaimed that “we think we have [the coronavirus] very well under control.”

“We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully,” Trump added. “But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.”

As we know now, the virus was anything but under control in the country at that time. But Trump didn’t just ignore the WHO — he also ignored warnings coming from his own government.

Trump was warned — but didn’t listen

During his press briefing on Thursday, Trump tried to portray himself as a victim. He described himself as “angry” because “people knew [the coronavirus outbreak] was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it.”

Trump says he's angry he wasn't told there was an epidemic: ""And I was angry, because this should have been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn't want to talk about it."" pic.twitter.com/XgWWaXAWTF — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) April 16, 2020

Those comments came days after Trump tried to push back on an in-depth New York Times report about his slow coronavirus response by tweeting that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar “told me nothing” about the coronavirus until after Trump restricted travel from China — a commendable move but one that came after the virus was already spreading in the US.

The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Trump’s claim about Azar is at odds with what multiple unnamed senior administration officials told the Washington Post. From a report published on March 20:

Inside the White House, Trump’s advisers struggled to get him to take the virus seriously, according to multiple officials with knowledge of meetings among those advisers and with the president. Azar couldn’t get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18, according to two senior administration officials. When he reached Trump by phone, the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market, the senior administration officials said.

Although Trump now wants people to believe he wasn’t adequately warned, that same Post report says intelligence agencies “were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February,” with one unnamed US official telling the paper that “Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it. ... The system was blinking red.”

It’s not just that one report, either. Trump also ignored White House memos prepared in January and February by his top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, including one addressed directly to him on February 23 warning in its very first sentence that “There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.”

Not only did Trump not heed that warning, but he did the opposite by telling Americans there was nothing to worry about. For instance, on February 26 — just three days after Navarro tried to sound the alarm — Trump held a news conference in which he suggested the coronavirus would soon go away on its own in the United States.

“When you have 15 [coronavirus cases], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said. (Less than two months later, the US now has nearly 700,000 cases and more than 31,000 deaths.)

On February 27, as the US confirmed case count stood at 15, Trump went even further, claiming of the coronavirus that “one day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

He has now moved the goalposts from saying the virus will go away to insisting that if as many as 100,000 American deaths would be evidence he did a good job. He’s criticizing the WHO not because he has good-faith concerns about the organization, but because it’s a useful distraction that is being amplified by loyal media outlets like Fox News.

https://www.vox.com/,"It has been clear for some time that the coronavirus pandemic is killing black and Latino Americans at disproportionately high rates, but new data from the last few days reveals just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been for people of color.

Starting in New York City, the American epicenter of the outbreak: Black New Yorkers are dying at twice the rate of their white peers; Latinos in the city are also succumbing to the virus at a much higher rate than white or Asian New Yorkers. The same trends can be seen in infection and hospitalization rates, too.

Mother Jones compiled data from all of the states that break out their coronavirus data by race and ethnicity. The same thing we’re seeing in New York City is happening across the country: Black and Latino Americans get infected with Covid-19 at alarmingly high rates and more are dying than we would expect based on their share of the population.

A few horrifying examples from the charts you can find in the link above:

In Wisconsin, black people represent 6 percent of the population and nearly 40 percent of Covid-19 fatalities

In Louisiana, black people make up 32 percent of the state’s population but almost 60 percent of fatalities

In Kansas, 6 percent of the population is black and yet black people account for more than 30 percent of the Covid-19 deaths

The proportions can change depending on the state, but the trends are consistent anywhere you look: Compared to their share of the population, greater numbers of people of color die than their white neighbors in this pandemic.

Why is that? Well, there are the more acute reasons (black and Latino people are being put at risk more in their day-to-day lives) and then there are the structural reasons (long-standing economic and health disparities between white people and people of color).

On the first, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in NYC is a useful and disturbing example. As the New York Times reported last week, bus and subway workers have been hit hard by the coronavirus: 41 dead and more than 6,000 either diagnosed with Covid-19 or self-quarantining because they have symptoms that suggest an infection, as of April 8.

Who works for the MTA? Black people and Latinos. They account for more than 60 percent of the agency’s workforce in New York City, according to estimates from 2016.

Black people in particular are overrepresented in the MTA; they are 46 percent of the city’s transportation workers versus 24 percent of its overall population. (White people, on the other hand, make up 30 percent of local MTA employees but 43 percent of NYC residents.)

This is, again, true across cities and sectors. As Devan Hawkins wrote in the Guardian, black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be employed in the essential services that have been exempted from state stay-at-home orders, and they are more likely to work in health care and in hospitals. In America as in other countries, health care workers make up a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases.

So the steps states and cities have taken to restrict public activities and slow the spread of the coronavirus, while undoubtedly necessary and productive, have still left people of color more exposed to infection and, ultimately, death during the pandemic.

Those risks are exacerbated by long-standing health inequities in America.

As Fabiola Cineas wrote for Vox last week, black Americans have historically had higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure than white Americans — all of which make a patient more vulnerable to developing a severe case of Covid-19 and ultimately dying.

I would add that they are also more likely to be uninsured, again for both structural reasons (all the states in the Deep South except for Louisiana have refused to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts black people) and because of the immediate crisis (black people were more likely to lose their job in the recent surge in unemployment). The same is true for Latinos.

And those are the macro trends. All over the country, smaller controversies and policy choices also worsen the health of black Americans and weaken their ability to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even something as seemingly simple as clean water to wash hands can be hard to come by for people of color, as this reporting by Khushbu Shah for Vox on Detroit (with 13,000 cases and 1,000 deaths in Wayne County) reveals:

Since 2014, over 140,000 homes in Detroit have had their water service disconnected as part of a debt-payment program, according to records obtained by local news outlet the Bridge. In 2019, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31, had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report). “They put the onus on the customer to have to go in and take affirmative steps [to restore their water], so there are a lot of people who do not know, or secondly, don’t have the ability to go in and meet with someone,” says veteran civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings, who is working to restore water to the city’s most vulnerable. Her daughter, a Detroit teacher and a cancer survivor, is battling coronavirus. Community groups, in the meantime, she said, are passing around five gallons of water to residents who don’t have water for drinking, cooking, or bathing, but Jennings doubts that residents are using the scarce water they have to wash their hands. “If the primary recommendation is ‘wash your hands, continuously, wash your hands,’ and there’s no water in the house to wash your hands,” the number of cases is certain to skyrocket, Jennings says.

For decades — centuries, really — America has failed the black and brown people who call it home. Today, as the coronavirus continues to take its toll, they are stuck paying the price for that failure.

April 9, 2020 | Oxford philosopher Toby Ord spent the early part of his career spearheading the effective altruism movement, founding Giving What We Can, and focusing his attention primarily on issue areas like global public health and extreme poverty. Ord’s new book The Precipice is about something entirely different: the biggest existential risks to the future of humanity. In it, he predicts that humanity has approximately a 1 in 6 chance of going completely extinct by the end of the 21st century. The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that tail risk is real. We always knew a zoological respiratory virus could become a global pandemic. But, collectively, we didn’t want to think about it, and so we didn’t. The result is the reality we live in now.

But for all the current moment’s horror, there are worse risks than coronavirus out there. One silver lining of the current crisis might be that it gets us to take them seriously, and avert them before they become unstoppable. That’s what Ord’s book is about, and it is, in a strange way, a comfort.

This, then, is a conversation about the risks that threaten humanity’s future, and what we can do about them. It’s a conversation about thinking in probabilities, about the ethics of taking future human lives seriously, about how we weigh the risks we don’t yet understand.

April 6, 2020 | In January, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to release a plan for combatting coronavirus. In March, she released a second plan. Days later, with the scale of economic damage increasing, she released a third. Warren’s proposals track the spread of the virus: from a problem happening elsewhere and demanding a surge in global health resources to a pandemic happening here, demanding not just a public health response, but an all-out effort to save the US economy. Warren’s penchant for planning stands in particular stark contrast to this administration, which still has not released a clear coronavirus plan. There is no document you can download, no web site you can visit, that details our national strategy to slow the disease and rebuild the economy.

So I asked Warren to return to the show to explain what the plan should be, given the cold reality we face. We discussed what, specifically, the federal government should do; the roots of the testing debacle; her idea for mobilizing the economy around building affordable housing; why she thinks that this is exactly the right time to cancel student loan debt; why America spends so much money preparing for war and so little defending itself against pandemics and climate change; whether she thinks the Democratic primary focused on the wrong issues; and how this crisis is making a grim mockery of Ronald Reagan’s old saw about “the scariest words in the English language.”

What social solidarity demands of us in a pandemic

April 2, 2020 | There is no doubt that social distancing is the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But the efficacy of social distancing (or really any other public health measure) relies on something much deeper and harder to measure: social solidarity.

“Solidarity,” writes Eric Klinenberg, “motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor’s door.” Klinenberg, a sociologist by trade, is the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. His first book, Heat Wave, found that social connection was, at times, literally the difference between life and death during Chicago’s 1995 heat wave. Since then, he’s spent his career studying trends in American social life, from the rise of adults living alone to the importance of “social infrastructure” in holding together our civic bonds.

This conversation is about what happens when a country mired in a mythos of individualism collides with a pandemic that demands social solidarity and collective sacrifice. It’s about preventing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation from overwhelming the most vulnerable among us. We discuss the underlying social trends that predated coronavirus, what kind of leadership it takes to actually bring people together, the irony of asking young people and essential workers to sacrifice for the rest of us, whether there’s an opportunity to build a different kind of society in the aftermath of Covid-19, and much more.

Coronavirus has pushed US-China relations to their worst point since Mao

March 30, 2020 | The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder that the worst really can happen. Tail risk is real risk. Political leaders fumble, miscalculate, and bluster into avoidable disaster. And even as we try to deal with this catastrophe, the seeds of another are sprouting.

The US-China relationship will define geopolitics in the 21st century. If we collapse into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism, the results could be hellish. And we are, right now, collapsing into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism.

The Trump administration, and key congressional Republicans, are calling COVID-19 “the Chinese virus,” and trying to gin up tensions to distract from their domestic failures. Chinese government officials, beset by their own domestic problems, are claiming the US military brought the virus to China. The US-China relationship was in a bad way six months ago, but this is a new level of threat.

Evan Osnos covers the US-China relationship for the New Yorker, and is author of the National Book Award winner, The Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China. In this conversation, we discuss the past, present and future of the US-China relationship. What are the chances of armed conflict? What might deescalation look like? And we know what the US wants — what, in truth, does China want?

Is the cure worse than the disease?

March 26, 2020 | “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself!” That was President Donald Trump, this week, explaining why he was thinking about lifting coronavirus guidelines earlier than public-health experts recommended. The “cure,” in this case, is social distancing, and the mass economic stoppage it forces. The problem, of course, is COVID-19, and the millions of deaths it could cause.

This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously. Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

March 25, 2020 | Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how long it will take to recover from the coronavirus crisis, its impact on startups, and how the US government should and will react — including by tracking individuals via their technology and repatriating cash from tech companies like Apple. Palihapitiya says businesses should make sure they have at least 36 months worth of cash on hand to weather this recession and its slow recovery period and predicts the US will need to devote an entire year’s GDP to combat covid-19. He criticizes the corporate “shenanigans” that will make economic recovery harder says he’s done investing for at least nine months, because anyone trying to do deals now will be “decapitated.” Plus: What we can all learn right now from the histories of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, and which industries will come out of this crisis stronger than before?

An economic crisis like we’ve never seen

March 23, 2020 | “What is happening,” writes Annie Lowrey, “is a shock to the American economy more sudden and severe than anyone alive has ever experienced.”

It’s also different from what anyone alive has ever experienced. For many of us, the Great Recession is the closest analogue — but it’s not analogous at all. There, the economy’s potential was unchanged, but financial markets were in crisis. Here, we are purposefully freezing economic activity in order to slow a public health crisis. Early data suggests the economic crisis is going to far exceed any single week or quarter of the financial crisis. Multiple economists have told Ezra Klein that the nearest analogy to what we’re going through is the economy during World War II.

“I have a secret advantage when trying to understand moments of economic upheaval. I’m married to Annie Lowrey,” writes Ezra Klein. “I can give you the bio — staff writer at the Atlantic, author of Give People Money (which is proving particularly prophetic and influential right now) — but suffice to say she’s one of the clearest and most brilliant economic thinkers I know. Her viral piece on the affordability crisis is crucial for understanding what the economy really looked like before Covid-19, and she’s been doing some of the best work on the way Covid-19 will worsen the economic problems we had and create a slew of new ones. But this isn’t just a conversation about crisis. It’s also a conversation about how to respond. I wouldn’t call it hopeful — we’re not there yet. But constructive.”

March 19, 2020 | Ron Klain served as the chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. In 2014, President Barack Obama tapped him to lead the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. He successfully oversaw a hellishly complex effort preparing domestically for an outbreak and surging health resources onto another continent to contain the disease.

But Klain is quick to say that the coronavirus is a harder challenge even than Ebola. The economy is in free fall. Entire cities have been told to shelter in place. And there’s no telling how long any of this will last. In this conversation, Klain answers Ezra Klein’s questions about the disease and how to respond to it, as well as questions many of you submitted.

March 16, 2020 | Maggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for the New York Times, talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the rest of the country has bypassed Trump’s failure to lead on the coronavirus outbreak; his exposure to COVID-19 at Mar-a-Lago and refusal to self-quarantine; and the toxic cocktail of practices in his administration: Infighting, tiptoeing, and sucking up.

She also discusses CDC director Anthony Fauci’s “unimpeachable” credibility vs. President Trump’s trust problem, how Vice President Pence is doing at the helm of the coronavirus task force, and how this period could have a bigger impact on Trump’s re-election chances than previous crises. Plus: Who is actually running things at the White House right now, and can Trump operate his campaign without mass rallies?

March 13, 2020 | Epidemic co-host Ron Klain, who led the White House’s ebola response under President Obama, talks to Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the COVID-19 outbreak will strain America’s healthcare system; how President Trump downplayed the crisis, rattling public confidence and delaying the country’s response; and the way people who work in the gig economy — including Uber drivers and food delivery workers — will be especially hurt by the situation. He also discusses the logic behind travel bans and limits of their efficacy, why it’s impossible for the US to completely cut itself off from China, and what Trump didn’t say in his Oval Office address, but should have. Klain, an adviser and former chief of staff to Joe Biden, also talks about the ex-vice president’s surprisingly successful presidential campaign and how it’s reckoning with Biden’s history of verbal flubs.

https://www.vox.com/,"The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in China in December, has had sweeping effects in the public health, business, and travel sectors, among others. And while the repercussions for the entertainment industry may seem to pale in comparison to the clear threat the virus poses to human life, the ripple effects do have implications for the people around the world who make a living producing and distributing movies, music, and more.

The immense and lucrative Chinese film industry was hit almost immediately as movie theaters across the country were closed and major releases were delayed. Hollywood soon began to feel the effects, too, and as time passes, the impact of the coronavirus on the global film and entertainment industries will certainly grow.

Consequences of the pandemic on these industries could range from lowered attendance at film festivals and disruptions in film distribution to delayed or canceled movie releases and concert dates to curtailed on-location film shoots. Financial ramifications will likely be felt by studios, filmmakers, theater owners, and more for months or even years.

Here are the biggest and most significant developments in the entertainment industry in response to the pandemic. Most recently, San Diego Comic-Con was canceled, Disney postponed the release of Pixar’s latest film, Soul; Saturday Night Live performed an “at-home” show; and theater industry leaders announced that Broadway shows would remain closed through at least June and probably longer.

Major entertainment festival cancellations and postponements

K-pop concerts canceled, including BTS shows: On February 28, the hugely popular K-pop group BTS canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul. The shows were scheduled for April 11 and 12 and April 18 and 19 at Seoul’s Olympic Stadium. The group’s management agency said the decision was made due to the impossibility of predicting the scale of the outbreak in South Korea come April and cited the health and safety of the musicians themselves, workers, and concertgoers. Two hundred thousand fans were expected to attend.

Days earlier, BTS had asked fans to avoid a series of TV appearances scheduled to promote their newest album, Map Of The Soul: 7, which had originally been planned to include studio audiences. The group also appealed to fans via a streamed press conference. “Health is always on our minds these days, and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you’re healthy, especially since it is very risky outside these days,” one of the singers, Jimin, said. ”I hope you take care of yourself.”

The entire Korean entertainment sector has been affected by the outbreak, and K-pop has been hit particularly hard, with groups including GOT7, Winner, Sechs Kies, (G) I-DLE, and others canceling scheduled tour dates. Variety reported that box office revenue in South Korea was down 30 to 40 percent in January 2020 compared to previous years.

SXSW canceled: On March 6, the city of Austin, Texas, declared a state of disaster, requiring the cancellation of public gatherings and events for the near future. The most notable of those is the cancellation of South by Southwest, the annual music, film, TV, and technology festival that serves as a significant financial powerhouse for the city.

The announcement came after a week full of major companies — including Netflix, Apple, Amazon, WarnerMedia, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Mashable, Intel, and more — dropping out of the well-attended event, canceling panels, premieres, and other appearances. Days later, SXSW organizers announced that they had laid off one-third of the festival’s employees in what they called “a necessary, but heartbreaking, step.”

Emerald City Comic Con delayed: The organizing body behind Emerald City Comic Con, the largest convention of its kind in Seattle, Washington, announced on March 6 that it will postpone the event until sometime this summer. The event was scheduled to run from March 12 to 16.

“We did everything that we could to run the event as planned, but ultimately, we are following the guidance of the local public health officials indicating that conventions should now be postponed,” convention organizers Reedpop said in a statement published on the Emerald City Comic Con website.

Cannes Film Festival delayed: The 2020 edition of the Cannes Film Festival, arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, is still in question following an announcement from the festival’s organizers on March 19 that the gathering could be delayed until “late June or early July,” or another time. (The festival had been slated to take place May 12 to 23 and draws thousands of industries and press from around the globe each year.) The festival first issued a statement on February 28 after the first case of coronavirus in nearby Nice, France, was confirmed by the city’s mayor, saying that organizers were monitoring the situation but planned for the festival to go forward. (Cannes is a seaside resort town located on the French Riviera, about 30 km from Nice.)

Coachella delayed: Goldenvoice, the organizers of Coachella, one of the largest annual music festivals in the US, announced on March 10 that the festival would be postponed due to concerns about Covid-19. Another Goldenvoice festival, the country music-oriented Stagecoach, has also been postponed.

The Indio, California-based event was originally set to run for two weekends, April 10-12 and April 17-19, with the same talent lineups performing both weekends. It will now run from October 9-11 and October 16-18. Stagecoach 2020 has been pushed back from April to October 23-25.

Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) canceled: The 2020 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) — the single biggest trade show in the video game industry — has been canceled. The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes the event, announced that it would not go forward with the annual event due to coronavirus fears in California, where E3 takes place. The event was scheduled for June 9 to 11.

The organization said it will contact exhibitors and attendees about receiving full refunds for passes, and that it is considering ways to “coordinate an online experience” in lieu of the in-person event. It also maintains that E3 will return next year as planned.

The NBA suspended basketball games indefinitely: A player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on March 11, leading NBA officials to call off that night’s Jazz game just before tip-off. As a further precautionary measure, the league issued a statement that it would suspend the basketball season “until further notice.”

Prior to putting an early pause on the rest of the season, the NBA made other efforts to protect players and fans. The league barred media from locker rooms, and publicly considered having teams play to empty arenas, before ultimately stopping play altogether.

2020 Tokyo Olympics delayed: On March 24, following pressure from athletes and multiple nations’ Olympic committees, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be postponed, possibly until 2021; on March 30, the dates were set for July 23-August 8, 2021.

San Diego Comic-Con 2020 canceled: On April 17, the organizers of San Diego Comic-Con announced that the yearly fan convention will not go on as planned in 2020. The event will resume once again in July 2021 at the San Diego Convention Center. The cancellation marks the first time in Comic-Con’s 50-year history that the event, the largest convention of its kind in the US, will not take place.

Major film release dates postponed or canceled

Newest Pixar film delayed: On April 13, Disney announced that Pixar’s latest release, Soul, would open on November 20, 2020. The film was previously set to open on June 19.

Disney makes sweeping changes to release calendar: On April 3, Disney made huge changes to its release calendar, setting dates for movies it had previously pulled without a date and moving others. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020, while Jungle Cruise, which had been set to release that day, moved to July 30, 2021. An untitled Indiana Jones film moved from July 9, 2021, to July 29, 2022.

Changes in the MCU calendar set off a domino effect. Black Widow is newly set for November 6, 2020, while the previous release on that date, Shang-Chi, shifted to May 7, 2021. Originally, Doctor Strange 2 was set to release on that date; it’s now set to open November 5, 2021, displacing Thor: Love and Thunder until February 28, 2022. Black Panther 2 is still currently set for May 6, 2022, and Captain Marvel 2 moved from July 22 to July 8, 2022.

Disney also owns 20th Century Films and Searchlight Films, which had a number of changes. The Ryan Reynolds film Free Guy moved from July 3 to December 11, 2020. West Side Story is still set for December 18 and Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel for Christmas Day. Wes Anderson’s newest film, The French Dispatch, moved from July 24 to October 16, 2020.

Artemis Fowl, which has seen its release date pushed several times already, will be released on Disney+.

Release dates for The New Mutants and The Woman in the Window (originally slated for April 3 and May 15, respectively) have not been set yet.

Sony delays nearly all its movies until 2021: On March 30, Sony announced that nearly all of its summer tentpole films would be delayed until late 2020 or early 2021. Delayed movies include Kevin Hart’s Fatherhood, Jared Leto’s Morbius, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Uncharted, and the previously delayed Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. The only film that appeared unaffected was the Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel, which is still set for theatrical release on July 16, 2020.

Wonder Woman 1984 and In the Heights releases delayed: On March 24, Warner Bros. announced that it would delay the release of Wonder Woman 1984 from June 5 to August 14. The studio also pulled three films from its release schedule: In the Heights, an adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical originally scheduled for a June 26 release; Scoob, a Scooby-Doo animated film originally scheduled for May 15; and Malignant, a thriller from Aquaman director James Wan that had originally been scheduled for August 14. (Malignant’s move is designed to make room for Wonder Woman 1984’s release.)

NBCUniversal to release major films digitally: In an unprecedented move, NBCUniversal announced on March 16 that it would make some movies available digitally the same day they are released in movie theaters that remain open, including Trolls World Tour, which is set to hit theaters on April 10. Movies currently in theatrical release will also be available on-demand, including The Hunt, The Invisible Man, and Emma. Movies are available for a 48-hour rental period for $19.99 in the US and an equivalent price abroad.

Disney postpones major releases: On March 12, Disney confirmed that three of its biggest releases of the year — Mulan (scheduled for March 27), The New Mutants (scheduled for April 3), and Antlers (scheduled for April 17) — would be postponed. Mulan is now set to open on July 24, 2020. The Chinese and European premieres of Mulan had previously been delayed as well.

On March 17, Disney announced the postponement of three more films: Black Widow (originally set for May 1), The Personal History of David Copperfield (May 8), and The Woman in the Window (May 15). The delays followed movie theater shutdowns in multiple states as well as country-wide shutdowns of Regal and AMC theaters.

Related Marvel delays the upcoming Black Widow solo film

No Time to Die: On February 16, MGM announced that it would cancel the Chinese premiere and publicity tour planned for the new James Bond movie, No Time To Die, which was scheduled for April. On March 4, the studio announced that it had delayed the film’s release until late November, making the film the first major tentpole release to be delayed worldwide.

Sonic the Hedgehog: On February 24, Paramount Pictures announced that it would delay the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in China, with a new release date to be determined.

Peter Rabbit 2: On March 10, Sony announced that it would push the global release of Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway from late March/early April to August.

A Quiet Place Part II: On March 12, A Quiet Place Part II director John Krasinski announced via Twitter that the movie’s planned March 19 release date would be delayed. “One of the things I’m most proud of is that people have said our movie is one you have to see all together. Well due to the ever-changing circumstances of what’s going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that,” he wrote. “As insanely excited as we are for all of you to see this movie ... I’m gonna wait to release the film till we CAN see it all together! So here’s to our group movie date! See you soon!”

Fast and Furious 9: On March 12, Universal Pictures announced that it would delay the release date of the ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise by 11 months, from May 22 to April 2, 2021.

Chinese movies scrapped theatrical release and premiere online: The biggest films of China’s year are usually scheduled to release during the Lunar New Year holiday, near the end of January, but mounting fears of the coronavirus and public reticence to be in crowded spaces caused distributors to voluntarily cancel or postpone several film releases. Huanxi, distributor of the Chinese blockbuster Lost in Russia, announced on January 22 that the film would premiere online for free. Promotional materials encouraged audiences to “stay safely at home and watch Lost in Russia with your mom.” On January 31, Enter the Fat Dragon became the second major Chinese film to premiere online, as theaters are closed by order of the government.

Film and TV productions halted, altered, or shut down

Saturday Night Live aired remotely produced content: On April 9, the producers of Saturday Night Live, which had been on hiatus since mid-March, announced that new, remotely produced material would air on NBC in the show’s usual Saturday night slot, 11:30 p.m. on April 11, including a “Weekend Update” segment.

The coronavirus has touched Saturday Night Live in at least two ways. The show’s long-time music supervisor, Hal Willner, passed away on April 7 at the age of 64; he was not formally diagnosed with the virus but had consistent symptoms. And Michael Che, one of the show’s co-head writers and co-anchor with Colin Jost of “Weekend Update,” announced via social media on April 6 that his grandmother had passed away from coronavirus complications.

The show joined other late-night comedy shows, such as NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, in creating comedy content remotely.

Eurovision canceled: On March 18, the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest announced via Twitter that the 2020 edition of the event was canceled. The event had been planned for May.

TV shows suspend production: Hundreds of shows have delayed or suspended production, including Apple’s The Morning Show and Little America; Netflix shows including Russian Doll; the CW’s Riverdale; NBC shows including the Chicago dramas and The Kelly Clarkson Show; CBS shows including the NCIS dramas, The Amazing Race, and Survivor; and many more.

Saturday Night Live also announced on March 16 that it would suspend its next three shows, the first of which was scheduled for March 28, with John Krasinski hosting. (Krasinski’s film A Quiet Place Part II, originally scheduled for release on March 19, was also delayed.)

Late-night shows suspend production or tape without a studio audience: Originally, on March 11, producers of shows including NBC’s The Tonight Show (hosted by Jimmy Fallon) and Late Night With Seth Meyers, CBS’s Late Show With Stephen Colbert, TBS’s Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Comedy Central’s Daily Show (hosted by Trevor Noah) all announced they would begin taping without a live studio audience on March 16.

A day later, NBC announced that The Tonight Show and Late Night would suspend production beginning the week of March 16; Stephen Colbert also announced that the Late Show would suspend production. All three shows were already scheduled to go into hiatus on March 23. On March 13, Jimmy Kimmel Live also suspended production.

Disney suspends live-action production: On March 13, Disney announced that production on its live-action movies would suspend production. Affected films include The Little Mermaid, a Home Alone reboot, and Peter Pan. Earlier in the day, production on Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings had been suspended due to director Destin Daniel Cretton’s decision to self-isolate upon advice of a doctor. (Marvel is owned by Disney.)

Jia Zhangke project delayed: At the Berlin Film Festival in February, famed Chinese director Jia Zhangke (Ash Is Purest White, A Touch of Sin) told Indiewire that production on his new film, which was slated to begin in April, was delayed indefinitely. Jia spoke with Indiewire at the Berlin Film Festival, where his documentary Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue premiered. But he said that before he left, he’d feared his flight to Berlin would be canceled, and that some of his collaborators chose not to make the trip. Regarding his next film, he said:

For some film companies and studios involved in pre-production, a lot of costs are going down the drain, and those that already started production have to be somehow cut short or suspended. Some of them are already in the process of distributing films and they’ve paid for a lot of promotion and PR costs. The economy is now taking a huge hit, and I think the investment side will be hugely impacted as well.

Mission: Impossible production paused: On February 26, Paramount Pictures announced that it had halted a planned three-week shoot in Venice for the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise. “Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan for our three-week shoot in Venice, the scheduled first leg of an extensive production for Mission: Impossible 7,” a Paramount spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter. “During this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves.”

Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune tape without a studio audience: Though Sony declined to comment, sources told the Hollywood Reporter on March 9 that scheduled tapings of the shows would go forward without a live studio audience. The measure was taken partly as a precaution for the health of Jeopardy host Alex Trebek, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announce they’ve contracted the virus: One of Hollywood’s biggest stars, Tom Hanks, announced that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the coronavirus while shooting Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film in Australia:

In a message posted publicly on March 11, Hanks was his typical upbeat self:

Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We’ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Entertainment venues and attractions shut down

All Disney parks shut down: On January 25, Disney shut down its Shanghai Disneyland park over fears of the coronavirus. The park is a major revenue generator, with 11.8 million guests in 2018, 50 percent from outside the Shanghai region, and an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue and $50 million in operating profit. A day after Shanghai Disneyland’s closure, Hong Kong Disneyland shut down. Both Disney parks in Japan closed on February 29 and Disney announced on March 11 that they will remain closed through at least the end of April.

Late in the day on March 12, Disneyland in California announced it would close the following day; by that evening, the company announced that all of its parks would close, including those in Florida and Disneyland Paris (where three staff had previously tested positive for coronavirus).

North American movie theaters shut down or begin “social distancing” measures: On March 13, a number of theaters and theater chains, including AMC Theatres, and the Canadian chain Cineplex, announced that they would be reducing the number of tickets sold to screenings by as much as 50 percent in order to enable patrons to sit further apart as part of “social distancing” measures.

On March 15, theaters in New York and Los Angeles were shut down by order of their respective mayors. On March 16, Regal announced it would shut down all of its 543 US theaters indefinitely; later in the day, AMC followed suit.

New York City cultural sites closed: On March 12, major cultural sites in New York City began to close, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other institutions canceled programming for the month of March, such as the New York Public Library and Carnegie Hall.

Within days, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that it anticipated staying closed through July and laying off much of its staff. On March 19, the Metropolitan Opera laid off all of its union employees, including musicians and chorus.

Broadway shows closed: On March 12, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that beginning at 5:00 pm, Broadway would be closed, part of a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. On April 8, the Broadway League announced that theaters would remain closed through June, and probably longer.

West End closes: On March 16, London’s West End shut down, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s speech urging Britons to avoid public spaces. The theaters, including the Royal Opera House, will stay closed indefinitely.

Italian cultural sites closed: In February, a number of major museums in Venice, Milan, Turin, and other northern Italian cities were closed as part of the government’s aggressive attempt to contain the virus, and annual Carnivale celebrations stopped early. By early March, with the country under complete lockdown, cultural sites across Italy were closed, including the Colosseum and Pompeii.

Chinese movie theaters shut down for months, tentatively begin to reopen, then re-close: Hoping to contain the coronavirus outbreak, on January 23 the Chinese government temporarily shut down movie theaters throughout the country until further notice. A total film production shutdown soon followed. Loss of revenue over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, during which movie theaters typically see an uptick in ticket sales, amounted to a staggering $1 billion, according to analysts.

By March 23, about 500 cinemas had reopened in China, roughly 5 percent of the cinemas in the country that were open before the outbreak. Variety reported that box office earnings remained minimal. But by March 27, they were closed again.

Chinese cultural attractions closed: Other cultural attractions and institutions in China that have been closed to the public include Tiananmen Square’s National Museum of China, the Forbidden City, and a section of the Great Wall of China located near Beijing.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump can’t help but sow division, even at a time when Americans are largely united in supporting stay-at-home orders and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Just after 11:21 am Eastern time on Friday, President Donald Trump posted a trio of tweets endorsing the so-called liberation of a trio of states with Democratic governors from measures they’ve taken to slow the spread of coronavirus.

These posts — which are among the most dangerous of Trump’s tenure — appear to have been inspired by a segment he saw on Fox News minutes earlier.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump began, with two further tweets saying “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd amendment. It is under siege!”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

At 11:19 — two minutes before Trump’s Minnesota tweet — Fox News ran a segment about small groups of right-wing protesters in Minnesota and Virginia who have been agitating for governors there to relax stay-at-home orders so they can resume normal shopping and traveling activities.

Watch:

Fox has extensively covered right-wing demonstrations in Michigan on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week, which echo the same theme. Early Friday afternoon, Fox News displayed chyrons promoting an anti-stay-at-home protest scheduled for later in the day in Minnesota.

Fox News’s coverage might give you the idea that these protesters represent the views of a significant chunk of people in their states. But polling indicates that’s not the case. For instance, a YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 61 percent of Americans think Trump should institute a nationwide stay-at-home order, compared to just 22 percent who are opposed. Along the same lines, polling from the Pew Research Central released on Thursday showed that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) noted in response to the so-called “Operation Gridlock” in her state, the sad irony is that such demonstrations could end up extending the need for stay-at-home orders by spreading the virus among protesters. But asked on Thursday if he thinks protesters in Michigan should listen to local officials like Whitmer, Trump said that such people listen to him instead.

“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me,” Trump said.

JON KARL: Shouldn't the anti-stay-at-home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities?



TRUMP: ""I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me."" pic.twitter.com/842jov2kY8 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

One shudders to contemplate what sorts of actions right-wing protesters might take if they interpret Trump’s call for them to “LIBERATE” their states seriously.

Share All sharing options for: This is the end of the office as we know it

If and when you return to your office after the novel coronavirus pandemic, you’ll probably notice some differences.

Upon entering your building, the doors may open automatically so you don’t have to touch the handles. Before you board your elevator, you might tell the elevator where you’d like to go, rather than pressing the many buttons within the elevator. When you reach your floor, you could walk into a room full of dividers and well-spaced desks instead of the crowded open floor plan you’re used to. In common areas like meeting rooms and kitchens, expect to see fewer chairs and posted documentation of the last time they were cleaned.

These are just the changes you can see. Less noticeable in the post-coronavirus office would be more frequent cleaning policies, antimicrobial properties woven into fabrics and materials, amped-up ventilation systems, or even the addition of UV lights for more deeply disinfecting the office at night.

Of course, this is all assuming you go back to your old office at all. As the coronavirus takes a steep toll on the economy and the workforce, many won’t have jobs to go back to. Some who are still employed will now permanently work from home, and some employers will choose to downsize their leases or look for flexible office space rather than long-term leases. Coworking spaces will probably never be what they once were as they forgo hot desks and communal spaces for more sanitary — and less profitable — private areas.

Many of these adjustments in office design are actually just accelerations of real estate trends that existed well before the pandemic. But just as policies around telehealth and liquor have quickly shifted, the Covid-19 crisis will force swift and permanent changes in both commercial real estate and work culture itself. The office as we know it will never be the same.

Working from home will be the new normal for many

According to a new MIT report, 34 percent of Americans who previously commuted to work report that they were working from home by the first week of April due to the coronavirus. That’s the same percentage of people who can work from home, according to a recent University of Chicago publication.

These new numbers represent a seismic shift in work culture. Prior to the pandemic, the number of people regularly working from home remained in the single digits, with only about 4 percent of the US workforce working from home at least half the time. However, the trend of working from home had been gaining momentum incrementally for years, as technology and company cultures increasingly accommodated it. So it’s also likely that many Americans who are now working from home for the first time will continue to do so after the pandemic.

“Once they’ve done it, they’re going to want to continue,” said Kate Lister, president of consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, which is currently running a survey about work-from-home participation. She predicts that 30 percent of people will work from home multiple days per week within a couple of years. Lister added that there has been pent-up demand by employees for greater work-life flexibility, and that the coronavirus has made their employers see the light, especially as they themselves have had to work from home.

“It had been proven prior to this, but a lot of company management and leaders showed great skepticism,” Steve King, partner at small-business consulting firm Emergent Research, told Recode. “That skepticism will go away because companies recognize that remote work does work.”

There’s a lot more at play than what employers and workers want, of course. The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs. For companies to reduce their rent obligations by letting workers work from home is an easy solution, one that’s less painful than layoffs. In Lister’s words, “The investor community is going to insist on it.”

Furthermore, the necessity of working from home brought on by the pandemic has also caused many employers and employees to spend money on new technology, like video conferencing subscriptions as well as new equipment. According to data from expense management provider Emburse, the most frequent employee expenses in the first half of March included computer monitors, desks, office supplies, mice, and keyboards — a departure from the norm. These purchases presumably happened at companies where working from home was a new development.

“Companies were caught with their pants down,” said Lister. “Companies where the technology and culture were aligned with working from home were more successful in working from home than others.”

More formalization and company policies around remote work are necessary for the shift to be successful. A recent PWC study showed that about half of businesses expect a dip in productivity during the pandemic due to a lack of remote work capabilities. Companies where people have worked from home for a while and have built up guidelines — about, say, what time of night is appropriate to expect a response on Slack, how employees can securely access company files, and whether employees are allowed to expense an at-home monitor or standing desk — will probably have an easier time working from home.

Employees themselves are also spending more money to create better home offices. Katie Storey, principal at Storey Design, says that her residential and commercial interior design firm is already seeing the trend.

“The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

“Instead of allocating a corner of the den,” she said, “there’s now a real focus on where can we convert a closet or add a room under the steps or where can we reconfigure parts of the house to be more functional work-from-home space.”

Regardless of how prepared they were, people have done what they had to do to make working from home work. In doing so, they moved the needle on what’s acceptable in the at-home office.

“It added some humanity to us,” Lister said. “You don’t have a choice: The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

Coronavirus will likely change the way office space looks and works

Working from home all the time is not for everyone, and many will want to return to the office. As the public health crisis continues, however, office space will probably have to be altered in order for people to feel safe being there. That could mean a reversal of the open office trend.

For years, the amount of privacy allotted to each person working in an office had been steadily decreasing as companies of all stripes adopted the ubiquitous — if often loathed — open office plan. In effect, that meant a very cool-looking office space where you could see many of your coworkers but where there was little separation between you and your colleagues’ germs. Prior to the open office, offices used to have, well, offices, or at least cubicles that divided up the larger space and gave employees a semblance of privacy

“I do think this is going to reshape the workplace,” Janet Pogue-McLaurin, principal and workplace leader at design and architecture firm Gensler, told Recode. “Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward.”

That means people will want more space. Following the last recession, companies had been trying to do more with less space. That meant packing more and more people into open office spaces, a practice known as “densification.”

“Densification will take a hiatus,” Pogue-McLaurin said. “We’ll shift to, ‘How do we dedensify to create the physical distancing that we now need to have?’”

That could mean more private spaces or personal offices for individuals, and more distance between desks. Rather than desk setups that face each other or are right next to each other, we might now be positioned to our colleague’s backs with more space between us. A conference room that normally fit 10 people might now only hold chairs for five. Expect greater spacing and fewer seating options in communal areas like kitchens as well.

“Every configuration of every floor plan should be assessed to look at distancing and safety,” Kate North, vice president of workplace strategy at Colliers International real estate company, said.

This could also mean the reintroduction of various types of barriers between desks, including much maligned cubicles, in order to block the passage of germs — an effort that might be harder given the prevalence these days of standing desk options.

Christine Cavataio, president and chief operating officer at architecture firm Cuningham Group, thinks that while physical barriers will be used in the short term, the more long-term architectural fix will be done with spacing.

In the immediate future, “we’ll see physical, hard things that create separation,” Cavataio said. “Over time, we will start to design differently to create space, versus how tight can we get it. Can we get our generous six feet of physical distance and still create a company environment people want to be in, knowing you have safety inherently based in the design?”

Commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield is testing a new design concept called “Six Feet Office” in which it visually displays unique foot traffic routing in the office to keep people the recommended six feet apart.

Perhaps more importantly, though less visible, will be the actions that facilities managers take to divert congestion points and clean offices. International Facility Management Association‎ (IFMA) is currently working in tandem with other specialized groups for cleaning and ventilation systems, among other things, to create guidelines and protocols for building operators around the world.

“There’s going to be a special effort to consider and think about every possible place within the built environment that a human being has touched and the possibility of that being a source of contamination,” Don Gilpin, president and chief operating officer at IFMA, said.

That effort could include everything from higher-quality air filtration systems to more-powerful cleaners. Every surface — including door handles, light switches, countertops, copy machine buttons, AV equipment, coffee makers, and many more — will have to be dealt with. According to Cavataio, regular offices will likely take cues from health care design. This shift could include the addition of things like copper fixtures, fabric that retains fewer germs and can more easily be cleaned, more space in kitchens and bathrooms, as well as more attention paid to how far liquids can splash. Some companies could even use UV lighting to disinfect offices at night or meeting rooms in between uses, a practice that’s increasingly common in hospitals.

Automation and voice technology could also play a role. Technology like Amazon Alexa for Business, for example, could become a new interface and remove the need for physically pushing a button or touching a surface in an office. As Bret Kinsella, founder & CEO of the voice technology publication Voicebot.ai, explained, “There is voice tech in warehouses today but very little in office settings. That will absolutely change.”

Inevitably, the most consequential way to prevent the spread of germs in an office might just be to limit the number of people allowed inside at once. Rather than having everyone work in the office from nine to five, companies might want to bring in certain teams at specific times to lessen congestion. The initial process of bringing employees back to work, at least, will probably be staggered.

“What we are anticipating is a gradual ramp-up of business as usual,” Gilpin said. “We are not expecting a flood gate of theaters and corporate spaces opening up to employees and the public. We see this as a gradual process.”

Demand for office space is uncertain

There are two conflicting trends that will affect whether or not the coronavirus leads to a sizable decrease in demand for office space.

First, fewer employees coming into the office, either due to layoffs or to an increase in working from home, could mean less need for office space.

“Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward”

As Tim Savage, a clinical assistant professor of real estate at NYU’s Schack Institute of Real Estate, put it, “As people are forced to work from home, personal space becomes an office. In a way, we’ve dramatically expanded the amount of office space we have.”

Second, safety protocols that require people to be spaced at least six feet apart could cause more demand for office space so that the people who work there aren’t as packed in as they used to be.

“In short, it is too early to tell if companies will lease less space,” Julie Whelan, Americas head of occupier research at commercial real estate services company CBRE, told Recode. “While they may need less space because some people may conduct some of their work remotely, they may also need more space to provide the social distancing that employees may feel they need to be comfortable.”

It’s possible these two trends will cancel each other out.

So far, CBRE has noted that as a result of the coronavirus and its containment measures, office leasing has slowed and vacancy rates are rising. But the company also says that office properties will be more insulated than other property types like hotels and retail.

“The impact on office [space] should not be as deep or broad as what was felt after the financial crisis,” Whelan said.

Experts say there will certainly be an acceleration of existing trends in office real estate, including a move away from traditional 10-year leases for shorter ones or for flexible or coworking space (more on that later). Still, the nature of existing office leases will likely temper upheaval in the office market.

“Those who signed 10-year leases a few years ago are legally obligated to meet the terms of those leases,” Savage, the NYU professor, said. “But this could affect expansion plans.”

Whatever happens to demand for more or less square footage, the coronavirus will likely affect the type of space people are looking for. Spaces with more private areas that might limit the spread of germs stand to become more popular, for example. And while meeting rooms will still be important, companies will likely reconsider the types of meeting rooms they want (and, by extension, question whether a meeting is necessary in person in the first place). Those new types of meeting rooms will be geared toward group projects and collaboration.

“We’re going to reevaluate face-to-face meetings: which are really important and which can be substituted,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin said. “We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships — and to create social distance without feeling awkward.”

Coworking is not doomed, but it’s destined to change

Proponents of coworking spaces have long argued that companies managing flexible office space would be able to weather a recession. That’s because, while a number of clients at coworking spaces might choose to liquidate their space completely, coworking companies expect an influx of new clients looking to downsize from traditional office space with long lease terms into so-called flexible or coworking space.

What the coworking space enthusiasts didn’t anticipate was a fear — and a legitimate safety hazard — of working in close quarters to others. Coworking companies like WeWork have already seen a rapid decrease in demand as clients with month-to-month commitments have dialed back or terminated their coworking memberships due to shelter-in-place orders during the pandemic. Experts say this setback hardly signals the end of coworking. It’s probably temporary, though it may lead to the demise of some struggling coworking companies.

“We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships”

“Before this crisis, we saw a slowdown in leasing activity to flexible space operators because the sector was starting to rationalize,” CBRE’s Whelan told Recode. “It is without a doubt that the industry is feeling pressure now, as is evidenced by the headlines around lay-offs among many of the major [coworking] brands.”

Before the Covid-19 crisis, many large companies were increasingly taking advantage of the flexible terms of coworking space rather than taking on long-term leases. That’s likely to continue, perhaps even more rapidly.

The uncertainty the coronavirus brings could cause more companies to look for flexible space that can accommodate rapid changes in their needs. Coworking spaces can also provide office environments for newly remote workers who choose to work outside the office.

“If anything, this crisis highlights why flexibility is valuable for companies,” Whelan said.

However, coworking as we know it will probably have to change to survive. Coworking spaces are known for their communal areas and shared amenities like hot desks, where anyone can use an open work station — and where it’s often unclear how recently the space has been cleaned.

“Think about the little phone booths people were starting to use for calls for privacy,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin noted. “If someone sneezed, you have a germ-filled little box.” (Months before the coronavirus outbreak, WeWork’s phone booths were already flagged as dangerous because they contained high levels of formaldehyde.)

In addition to heightened cleaning protocols, coworking spaces will have to rethink their vaunted — and highly profitable — use of communal space. Fitting as many people as possible into one location won’t be as acceptable as it used to be. Like with regular offices, keeping coworking spaces safe in a post-coronavirus world will probably lead to more dividers and private offices. That might also mean fewer chance encounters between people from different teams and companies — interactions that coworking companies say differentiate them from regular office real estate companies.

Fortunately for coworking companies, their growing base of enterprise clients had already been moving in that direction, leasing whole sections, floors, and even buildings from coworking companies.

“Pre-Covid, the trends were already tilted toward more private team space within those operations,” said Mark Gilbreath, CEO and founder of LiquidSpace, a platform for companies to get flexible office space.

“What will be most in demand will be spaces that offer a measure of control and privacy during the recovery, when there’s still uncertainty financially and from a health and safety perspective.”

So for those who do return to their office jobs following the coronavirus, the space will look different, and they’ll be functional for a different future. Hopefully, that will mean they’re safer, too.

https://www.vox.com/,"As President Donald Trump pushes for the relaxation of social distancing guidelines and the resumption of something resembling pre-coronavirus social and economic activity, his supporters on Fox News are reaching for talking points to justify this course of action. A recent appearance on Hannity by Dr. Mehmet Oz illustrated how this search has run into significant moral roadblocks.

Dr. Oz — who got his start years ago on Oprah and has lately become a ubiquitous presence on Fox News, making daily appearances in which he regularly promotes unproven, dangerous drugs — made a case on Tuesday that reopening schools is “a very appetizing opportunity,” citing a study that he claimed showed doing so would only increase coronavirus deaths by 2 to 3 percent.

“Well, first, we need our mojo back. Let’s start with things that are really critical to the nation where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble,” Dr. Oz said. “I tell you, schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3 percent, in terms of total mortality. And, you know, any life is a life lost, but to get every child back into a school where they’re safely educated, being fed and making the most out of their lives, with a theoretical risk on the backside, it might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

DR OZ: ""Schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in The Lancet arguing the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3%, in terms of total mortality. Any, you know, any life is a life lost, but ... that might be a tradeoff some folks would consider."" pic.twitter.com/aifMeKTsIv — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

(On Thursday evening, Dr. Oz posted a video on Twitter saying that “I’ve realized my comments on risks around opening schools have confused and upset people, which was never my intention. I misspoke.)

It should be noted that Dr. Oz misinterpreted The Lancet study he mentioned. What it actually details is a finding made by UK researchers that closing schools there without any other mitigation measures (such as social distancing) would reduce baseline Covid-19 deaths there by somewhere between 2 percent and 4 percent. The study does not speak to what impact the reopening of US schools would have on the coronavirus mortality rate here, so Oz’s analysis was confused. (Ironically, The Lancet’s underlying source is the very same WHO/Imperial College model that Fox News hosts have been trashing.)

That aside, Oz’s remarks come as the most-cited models now forecast the US will experience somewhere around 60,000 Covid-19-related deaths. (The total stands at over 33,000 as of today.) A 4 percent increase of that total represents an additional 2,400 lives. So what Dr. Oz was trying to say is that the prospect of that many additional deaths in exchange for the reopening of schools “might be a trade-off some folks would consider.”

While there’s no study backing up the numbers Dr. Oz threw around, the fact he was so callous about more than 62,000 lives is instructive in its own right. It points toward what a chorus of right-wing voices seem willing to sacrifice in the hope of restoring a sense of normalcy.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus”

With a tough reelection campaign on the horizon and the economy he spent so much time boasting about during his first three years in office in ruins, Trump has self-interested reasons for wanting to get kids back to school and parents back to work. But the data indicates that from a public health standpoint, doing so at this point in time would be premature.

First of all, a quick look at the data shows that the US coronavirus curve hasn’t really flattened yet. Unlike countries like South Korea or Taiwan, the number of cases here continues to increase in something approximating an exponential manner.

Second, other countries that have had far less of a problem with the coronavirus, such as Germany, have just started to consider reopening schools — and schools that have reopened in Denmark, which recently became the first European country to take that step, have done so with new, strict social distancing rules. The idea that schools in a country where the coronavirus is currently killing 2,000 people a day (or more) are ready to reopen is out of step with reality.

Trump is looking for evidence — any evidence — to back his reopening position

As callous as they may be, Oz’s comments do reflect a talking point that’s gaining steam on the right as frustration has mounted with the social distancing measures (including school closures) that most Americans have endured for the past month.

On Wednesday, for instance, host Laura Ingraham pointed out that everything we do in life comes with some degree with risk, and used that observation to suggest continued social distancing measures represent government overreach.

“Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus,” she said, in an observation similar to the one made by Dr. Oz.

Laura Ingraham: ""Many are willing to take the risk of contracting the virus"" pic.twitter.com/woc5NLGfS3 — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) April 16, 2020

Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson’s show featured him confronting Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) about the constitutionality of stay-at-home orders and an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) in which Kennedy said, “we gotta reopen, and when we do the coronavirus is gonna spread faster.”

“You know what kills more people every year than coronavirus — a lot more? Poverty,” Carlson replied, using a false equivalency Trump has also given voice to.

Sen Kennedy: ""We've gotta reopen, and when we do the coronavirus is gonna spread faster"" pic.twitter.com/v3KsK0XPEw — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) April 16, 2020

While it’s true that we’re all going to die someday, most people would rather it not happen in the short- to medium-term future because of a communicable disease whose spread we could slow if people would just stay home for the foreseeable future. In fact, new surveys from Gallup and Pew show that more people are afraid of lifting restrictions too quickly rather than keeping them around too long. Nor do we want our neighbors or their children’s teachers to meet their demise in that way.

One person’s statistic is another person’s mother or grandmother. Sacrificing thousands of lives in a misbegotten attempt to get back to normalcy is only an “appetizing opportunity” when you assume the lives lost aren’t your own or those of the people you love.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump can’t help but sow division, even at a time when Americans are largely united in supporting stay-at-home orders and social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Just after 11:21 am Eastern time on Friday, President Donald Trump posted a trio of tweets endorsing the so-called liberation of a trio of states with Democratic governors from measures they’ve taken to slow the spread of coronavirus.

These posts — which are among the most dangerous of Trump’s tenure — appear to have been inspired by a segment he saw on Fox News minutes earlier.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” Trump began, with two further tweets saying “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd amendment. It is under siege!”

LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

At 11:19 — two minutes before Trump’s Minnesota tweet — Fox News ran a segment about small groups of right-wing protesters in Minnesota and Virginia who have been agitating for governors there to relax stay-at-home orders so they can resume normal shopping and traveling activities.

Fox has extensively covered right-wing demonstrations in Michigan on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week, which echo the same theme. Early Friday afternoon, Fox News displayed chyrons promoting an anti-stay-at-home protest scheduled for later in the day in Minnesota.

Fox News’s coverage might give you the idea that these protesters represent the views of a significant chunk of people in their states. But polling indicates that’s not the case. For instance, a YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 61 percent of Americans think Trump should institute a nationwide stay-at-home order, compared to just 22 percent who are opposed. Along the same lines, polling from the Pew Research Central released on Thursday showed that 66 percent of people are concerned their state governments will relax social distancing restrictions too soon, compared to just 32 percent who are worried they won’t move quickly enough.

As Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) noted in response to the so-called “Operation Gridlock” in her state, the sad irony is that such demonstrations could end up extending the need for stay-at-home orders by spreading the virus among protesters. But asked on Thursday if he thinks protesters in Michigan should listen to local officials like Whitmer, Trump said that such people listen to him instead.

“I think they’re listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me,” Trump said.

JON KARL: Shouldn't the anti-stay-at-home protesters in Michigan listen to local authorities?



TRUMP: ""I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me."" pic.twitter.com/842jov2kY8 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 16, 2020

One shudders to contemplate what sorts of actions right-wing protesters might take if they interpret Trump’s call for them to “LIBERATE” their states seriously.

https://www.vox.com/,"Kentucky’s heavily Republican legislature voted Tuesday to require voters to show a government-issued photo ID, overriding Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto in the process.

Meanwhile, if a Kentucky voter heads to the state’s webpage hoping to learn how to obtain such an ID, they will encounter a message telling them ID-issuing offices are closed.

Strict voter ID laws are increasingly common in Republican-controlled states, and left-leaning groups like students, low-income voters, and voters of color are especially less likely to have the ID that these laws require. Although voter ID’s policy proponents often argue that the measure is necessary to combat voter fraud at the polls, such fraud is so rare that it is virtually nonexistent.

While voter ID laws, at best, are a solution in search of a problem, Kentucky’s new law could prove to be a particularly potent attack on the right to vote during a pandemic.

Voter ID laws serve no legitimate purpose

The ostensible function of a voter ID law is to prevent someone from impersonating another voter in order to cast a ballot in their name. But numerous studies and investigations show that the primary form of voter fraud addressed by these laws, impersonation fraud at the polls, is only slightly more common than unicorns.

A study by Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, who led much of the Justice Department’s voting rights work during the Obama administration, found only 35 credible allegations of in-person voter fraud among the 834 million ballots cast in the 2000-2014 elections. A Wisconsin study found just seven cases of any kind of fraud among the 3 million cast in the 2004 election — and none of these seven were the kind that could be prevented by voter ID. In 2014, Iowa’s Republican Secretary of State Matt Schultz announced the results of a two-year investigation into election misconduct within his state. He found zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls.

Notably, when the Supreme Court allowed an Indiana voter ID law to take effect in Crawford v. Marion County (2008), it was only able to identify a single case of in-person voter fraud at the polls in the preceding 140 years.

Voter ID laws target an imaginary problem, but at least some studies show that they particularly affect voters who lean Democratic. While there’s no firm research consensus on the laws’ effect, several studies have found that voter ID has no meaningful impact on voter turnout (although others have found significant effects). In a close election, though, even a small effect on turnout could matter.

At best, voter ID achieves nothing at all in an ordinary election while erecting an additional barrier to people exercising their right to vote — a barrier that disproportionately affects low-income and black and Latino Americans. Under normal circumstances, voter ID could potentially make a difference in a close election.

Voter ID could have severe consequences during a pandemic

It’s far from clear that November’s general election will be anything resembling normal.

Late last month, Gov. Beshear handed down an executive order providing that “all businesses that are not life-sustaining shall cease operations ... except as needed to conduct Minimum Basic Operations.” Among other things, the order suspends “all in-person government activities ... that are not necessary to sustain or protect life, or to supporting Life-Sustaining Businesses.”

Thus, Kentucky voters who lack an ID — perhaps because they recently moved to the state and didn’t get around to obtaining a Kentucky driver’s license before the coronavirus lockdown began — may be unable to obtain this ID in time to vote because the state offices that issue such IDs are closed. The future of life under coronavirus remains very uncertain, and it is, as yet, unclear when the country will return to anything resembling normal.

Even if Kentucky is able to relax restrictions as more testing for the virus becomes available, it may need to reimpose strict limits on businesses and government offices if an outbreak occurs. Voters may only have a limited window to acquire an ID, and that window might close just as a particular voter was preparing to obtain one.

Kentucky’s law, moreover, also resembles a similar Wisconsin law in that it requires voters to show ID in order to obtain an absentee ballot. So voters without ID cannot escape the law by voting by mail.

The new law does permit some voters to cast a ballot without showing photo ID — if they sign a sworn statement affirming that they are lawful voters and providing certain information. But this exemption from the photo ID requirement is only available to a limited group of voters, and it is far from clear that a healthy voter qualifies because they were unable to obtain an ID because government offices were shut down during a pandemic.

Although the law allows a voter to cast a ballot without showing photo ID if they were prevented from getting an ID due to “disability or illness,” the statute is not clear on whether the voter must themselves be infected by this illness in order to qualify. And voters who misuse the exemption could potentially face perjury charges.

It’s worth noting that there could potentially be a very high-profile race on Kentucky’s ballot this November. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is up for reelection, and there is some evidence that McConnell could be defeated if 2020 is a strong year for Democrats. In January, for example, one poll showed McConnell just 3 percentage points ahead of possible Democratic challenger Amy McGrath, and a second poll showed McConnell and McGrath tied.

So, while the impact of voter ID is uncertain under normal circumstances, there are good reasons to believe that such a law could have a larger effect during a pandemic. Whether that impact would be enough to skew a close election from McGrath to McConnell is also unclear. But, at the very least, many voters could struggle to cast a ballot if they are unable to obtain the IDs they need to vote.

https://www.vox.com/,"As the harms of social distancing become more and more apparent, Americans may start to wonder: Are we overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic?

A few people (although not most of the public) seem to think so. Some federal officials, from President Donald Trump to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), have asked if “the cure is proving worse than the disease itself.” Protesters in several states, including Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky, have called for lockdowns to end, arguing that the damage to the economy is too much to bear.

This is a question public health experts and officials expected from the start. As Kent State University epidemiologist Tara Smith told me, “It’s the paradox of public health: When you do it right, nothing happens.”

The problem with proper prevention, the linchpin of many public health strategies, is that there’s no clear indication when it works. There’s no public celebration when a coronavirus case or death doesn’t happen.

And in the meantime, the economic damage of closing down America is readily apparent. Some economists warn that the unemployment rate could surpass 30 percent. About 22 million have filed unemployment claims since social distancing measures took effect in March. The lines for food aid are stretching for blocks across the country. It’s now much more difficult — if not impossible — to visit family and friends and partake in many favorite hobbies and activities.

In other words, the benefits of social distancing aren’t very visible, while the pain from it is. That creates a situation in which it can be easy to take for granted that social distancing is, according to experts and models, likely preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US.

But it’s important to remind ourselves what we’re doing here. The US wants to avoid getting to the point where it’s obvious we did something wrong and need to correct course. We want to prevent what happened in Italy, Spain, or New York from happening across the country. That means reacting not just to what’s visible to us in the present, but what’s potentially in the future. Doing that will always at some level seem like an overreaction, even if it’s the right call.

“Anytime you are dealing with an outbreak, if it appears like you overreacted, then you probably did the right thing,” Krutika Kuppalli, a fellow in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity program, told me.

That’s particularly true for coronavirus. There’s still a lot we need to learn about the virus, but we do know it seems to spread at least in part through people who aren’t showing any symptoms. That means it can be spreading in communities without anyone — not even the people who are infected — knowing it. That requires taking action before the virus is clearly visible, at least without mass testing, in a community.

There’s also evidence from past outbreaks, particularly the 1918 flu pandemic, that reacting quickly and aggressively — even before a disease clearly poses a threat — is crucial both to saving lives and, in the long term, potentially keeping the economy intact.

Yes, it demands a shared sacrifice at this time. But it’s worth it. The alternative — that we let up to millions of people, including our friends, family, and peers, die — is so bad we need to do everything we can to prevent it.

The coronavirus requires what might seem like an overreaction

It’s true that we still don’t know enough about the SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. That can seem like a reason to not do much: Maybe the virus isn’t as contagious or as deadly as we think it is. Maybe it’ll die down in the summer with warmer weather. Maybe only specific segments of the general population are really vulnerable.

That’s all possible. But remember: Even if all of this and more turns out to be true in the future, the reality is we simply don’t know that now and didn’t know it before. We have to act with the best information we have. And that information suggests the coronavirus is really bad — whether it’s a huge outbreak in Wuhan, China, that forced the country to lock down, the outbreak in Italy that overwhelmed its health care system, or the outbreak in New York that has turned the US into the world’s leader in reported cases and deaths (with more than 639,000 and 30,000, respectively, as of April 16 — and both figures are likely underestimates).

We also know that the coronavirus can spread from people who don’t have symptoms yet or will never develop significant symptoms. That could mean the disease is less deadly than we think; if there are a lot more asymptomatic carriers than we realize, it could mean a way smaller fraction of the people who are infected are dying.

But it also means that the virus can spread before it’s even clearly visible in a community. That’s been particularly exacerbated by America’s poor testing capacity — a result of both poor pandemic preparedness generally and President Donald Trump’s slow reaction to the outbreak — leaving the country unable to quickly test people to see if there’s asymptomatic spread. (To this end, we actually underreacted to Covid-19, and have continued doing so by failing to scale up testing.)

“Your chance of the first case being the one that comes to your attention is very, very, very, very small,” George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the UCSF, told me. “By the time you have the first death, you have to figure that there’s been three full weeks of transmission, and there are at least several hundred cases in the population.”

So once a city, state, or country is reporting a few Covid-19 cases and especially deaths, it’s typically safe to assume there is a much bigger outbreak going on — just one that’s not fully visible, at least yet, to the public. Given that coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, it’s important for the public and officials to act quickly and preemptively to stop exponential growth.

It’s in this context that it’s so important that countries do what can feel like an overreaction. If you wait until there are already a bunch of cases or deaths in your community, it could be too late to prevent an outbreak that even extreme social distancing might be unable to get under control for weeks.

Consider the stories of California and New York. California actually reported some of the first coronavirus cases and deaths in the country — including the first case of community transmission — but now New York has 14 times the Covid-19 deaths as California. There are important differences between the states, such as New York City’s much higher population density and greater public transportation use. It’s also possible New York just got unlucky: “There’s the possibility that there were just more introductions of the virus in the East Coast, in the New York area,” Jeffrey Martin, an epidemiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told me.

But one likely contributor is that California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, reacted quicker to the outbreak. The Bay Area issued America’s first shelter-in-place order on March 16, and California issued a statewide stay-at-home order three days later — while New York didn’t until March 22. Even before the government mandates, some parts of California seemed to adopt social distancing early: Restaurant data from OpenTable suggests that seated dining on March 1 was down 2 percent in New York City, but it was down 18 percent in San Francisco. (Though it was only down by 3 percent in Los Angeles, so not every place in California acted the same.)

The extra days and weeks may not seem like that much time. But when coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, that short time span can be important. “With this virus, days, and even hours, matter,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

It could have been easy at the time to make the case that California and particularly the Bay Area were overreacting, given that the entire state had fewer than 25 deaths when it locked down. But it ultimately seems like it was the right decision.

Previous research is clear: Outbreaks require strong, early action

While there’s a lot about the coronavirus and the nature of this outbreak that we still don’t know, research from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was linked to as many as 100 million deaths globally and about 675,000 deaths in the US, provides some useful evidence for strong, early action.

A 2007 study in PNAS found that the places that took quicker action on social distancing — closing schools and banning big public gatherings — saw better outcomes:

[C]ities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (≈20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.

One example cited in the study is the difference between Philadelphia, which was slow to act, and St. Louis, which was faster. As this chart shows, St. Louis did a much better job of flattening the curve and averting excess deaths:

Another 2007 study, published in JAMA, validated the findings — showing places that acted earlier and more aggressively saved lives. But this study also demonstrated the importance of sustaining social distancing measures: When cities, including St. Louis, pulled back their measures too quickly, they saw a spike in deaths.

Here’s how that looks in chart form, with the line chart representing excess flu deaths and the black and gray bars below showing when social distancing measures were in place. The highest peak comes after social distancing measures were lifted, with the death rate falling only after they were reinstated.

This did not just happen in St. Louis. Analyzing data from 43 cities, the JAMA study found this pattern repeatedly across the country. Howard Markel, an author of the study and the director of the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine, described the results as a bunch of “double-humped epi curves” — officials instituted social distancing measures, saw flu cases fall, then pulled back the measures and saw flu cases rise again.

Notably, the second rise in deaths only appeared when cities removed social distancing measures, the JAMA study found: “Among the 43 cities, we found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect.”

While invoking social distancing is often presented as a choice between saving lives and sustaining the economy, there’s also some preliminary evidence that the early, aggressive actions help the economy in the long term as well. Dylan Matthews covered a recent study along these lines for Vox:

Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner released a working paper (not yet peer-reviewed) last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively. The three analyzed the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in the United States, as the closest (though still not identical) analogue to the current crisis. They compare cities in 1918-’19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later. Their conclusion? “We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over.”

The basic problem is that a lot of people getting sick and dying is also pretty bad for the economy — potentially worse than temporarily shutting the economy down.

The risk for us now, by believing we might be overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic, is thinking we can ease up on measures, doing it, and subsequently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths. In fact, that already appears to be happening in some parts of the world; Asian countries that initially contained the outbreak, such as South Korea and Singapore, are now reporting signs of a second wave of cases after easing some of their restrictions.

None of this completely eliminates the possibility that we are overreacting. Maybe a year or two from now we’ll realize that we didn’t have to close down certain parts of the country. Or maybe certain segments of the population could have remained at their jobs. Or maybe the warmer temperatures could slow the virus’s spread more than we think (though heat hasn’t been enough in Singapore, where it’s currently 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit). We just don’t know.

But as public health experts have told me, it’d be much better to end up second-guessing ourselves about whether we overreacted than whether we underreacted and maybe caused the deaths of millions. Because that’s the risk right now, based on the best evidence we have.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s latest spin is that while he always took the coronavirus seriously, his early efforts to respond to it were hampered by World Health Organization misinformation and a lack of warnings from American government officials. He’s rewriting history.

On Friday morning, Trump, echoing something he saw on Fox News, accused the WHO of making “several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading” in January and February.

Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020

In fact, Trump was warned many times about the virus early on — both by officials from his government and from the WHO. But rather than heed those warnings, he spent January and February downplaying the threat. He told Americans they had nothing to worry about because his government had it under control. He only treated the pandemic with the seriousness it requires when it became undeniable that the country was headed into the crisis we’re now dealing with.

With a tough reelection fight looming and the economy in tatters, those facts are inconvenient for Trump. He’s now trying to prematurely move on from the coronavirus and put his slow response down the memory hole.

Trump has done the same thing he’s accusing the WHO of doing

America isn’t over the coronavirus hump yet. A record 4,591 people died from the virus in a 24-hour period ending Thursday evening. But Trump is cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the country’s lack of testing capacity to justify quickly reopening relatively unscathed parts of the country. And as he does that, he’s trying to change the topic from his administration’s performance to the WHO.

To be clear, it’s fair to criticize the WHO for a tweet it posted on January 14 citing “[p]reliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities” that found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” That turned out to be devastatingly wrong. But Trump should also look in the mirror.

On January 24, for instance, he publicly praised China’s handling of the coronavirus, saying the US “greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.” Most experts now believe the Chinese government was hiding the full extent of the outbreak.

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

And if Trump’s criticism is that the WHO spread dangerous misinformation, then he’s on thin ice there as well. The president has regularly pushed unproven and potentially lethal drugs as miracle cures. On Thursday, he posted tweets encouraging anti-stay-at-home-order protests in Minnesota and Michigan that could become vectors for spreading the virus.

Almost no masks and no regard for social distancing guidelines outside of the Governor’s Residence. @MPRnews pic.twitter.com/8aMLHSHYzA — Evan Frost (@efrostee) April 17, 2020

While Trump is now trying to cast the WHO as a villain, the reality is that the US coronavirus response would’ve been much more effective had he actually followed some of the organization’s key recommendations about testing and social distancing. Instead, Trump sat idly by while the virus spread across the country in a mostly undetected manner in February and only embraced social distancing in mid-March, when public healths experts begin to sound the alarm about the possibility that American hospitals could be overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients like ones in China and Italy were.

This isn’t to say the WHO is blameless. The organization can also be fairly criticized for waiting until January 30 to declare coronavirus a public health emergency. But that declaration had no discernible impact on Trump, who on that very same day proclaimed that “we think we have [the coronavirus] very well under control.”

“We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully,” Trump added. “But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.”

As we know now, the virus was anything but under control in the country at that time. But Trump didn’t just ignore the WHO — he also ignored warnings coming from his own government.

Trump was warned — but didn’t listen

During his press briefing on Thursday, Trump tried to portray himself as a victim. He described himself as “angry” because “people knew [the coronavirus outbreak] was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it.”

Trump says he's angry he wasn't told there was an epidemic: ""And I was angry, because this should have been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn't want to talk about it."" pic.twitter.com/XgWWaXAWTF — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) April 16, 2020

Those comments came days after Trump tried to push back on an in-depth New York Times report about his slow coronavirus response by tweeting that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar “told me nothing” about the coronavirus until after Trump restricted travel from China — a commendable move but one that came after the virus was already spreading in the US.

The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Trump’s claim about Azar is at odds with what multiple unnamed senior administration officials told the Washington Post. From a report published on March 20:

Inside the White House, Trump’s advisers struggled to get him to take the virus seriously, according to multiple officials with knowledge of meetings among those advisers and with the president. Azar couldn’t get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18, according to two senior administration officials. When he reached Trump by phone, the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market, the senior administration officials said.

Although Trump now wants people to believe he wasn’t adequately warned, that same Post report says intelligence agencies “were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February,” with one unnamed US official telling the paper that “Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it. ... The system was blinking red.”

It’s not just that one report, either. Trump also ignored White House memos prepared in January and February by his top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, including one addressed directly to him on February 23 warning in its very first sentence that “There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.”

Not only did Trump not heed that warning, but he did the opposite by telling Americans there was nothing to worry about. For instance, on February 26 — just three days after Navarro tried to sound the alarm — Trump held a news conference in which he suggested the coronavirus would soon go away on its own in the United States.

“When you have 15 [coronavirus cases], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said. (Less than two months later, the US now has nearly 700,000 cases and more than 31,000 deaths.)

On February 27, as the US confirmed case count stood at 15, Trump went even further, claiming of the coronavirus that “one day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

He has now moved the goalposts from saying the virus will go away to insisting that if as many as 100,000 American deaths would be evidence he did a good job. He’s criticizing the WHO not because he has good-faith concerns about the organization, but because it’s a useful distraction that is being amplified by loyal media outlets like Fox News.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s not unusual for Fiona Apple fans to wait years and years for a new album from the iconoclastic singer-songwriter. The shortest gap between Apple’s record releases was three years, with 1999’s When the Pawn... following her 1996 debut Tidal. Indeed, in the 20 years between When the Pawn... and 2019, she had released just two additional albums.

But now it’s 2020, and Apple has released Fetch the Bolt Cutters, her fifth album and first in eight years, since 2012’s The Idler Wheel... (Apple loves long album titles — hence all the ellipses.) What’s most remarkable is that Bolt Cutters might be Apple’s best release in a 24-year career full of seemingly perfect albums — and that it feels eerily well-timed for an album that was actually recorded between 2015 and 2019 but which sort of feels like Apple maybe just recorded it yesterday.

Bolt Cutters is “about” a great many things (if anyone can claim any Apple album, full of eclectic influences and ideas, to be “about” any handful of things). It tackles women’s rage at the indignities we are forced to suffer under the patriarchy, Apple’s own ambivalence about entering her 40s (except maybe that ambivalence is also fueled by the patriarchy???), and the difficulty of finding lasting love at any age.

But what most resonates throughout Bolt Cutters is the feeling of being trapped somewhere, slowly unraveling, impotently furious about a world that is tearing itself apart without your consent. The album sounds like being in a car where everybody else is only too happy to be speeding toward a cliff. It’s like not being able to sleep because you’re so worried about some indefinable something.

All of which, uh, might sound familiar at the moment.

It’s been a long time since an album arrived with the level of hype Fetch the Bolt Cutters has received

Like a stereotypical woman in her 30s, I listen to very little new music. The simple reason is that, at some point in the last few years, I decided I’d had enough new music, thank you very much. But when my friend Hannah urgently sent me an emphatic message saying that I had to listen to Fetch the Bolt Cutters, well, who was I to say no?

Hannah’s urgency was matched by that of seemingly the entire internet. As I write this, the album has been out for a little over 12 hours, but it’s already generated the level of hype that albums rarely receive in the age of streaming, where picking and choosing from artist’s individual single drops carry more weight than any complete album release could. To be sure, some of the hype stems from this being Apple’s first album release in eight years. But just as much comes from how good it is.

Apple’s music has always thrived on the intimacy she fosters with the listener. Every choice she makes is designed to draw you into her world, to make you understand things her way for the length of time you’re listening to her music. Bolt Cutters takes this even further. It was recorded in Apple’s home in Los Angeles, and songs frequently have the barking of dogs faintly (or not so faintly) painting the background of the soundscape. You’re not just making sense of the world through her eyes; you’re sheltering in place with her, looking out the window at a city turned into a ghost town.

The most obvious theme many will draw from Bolt Cutters is its overlap with the rise in women being open about their experiences with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the last several years. The album’s best song, “Under the Table,” frequently turns to Apple snarling, “Kick me under the table all you want/I won’t shut up,” and it’s not hard to extrapolate this into a larger comment on women who feel as though they’ve gone unheard for too long.

Bolt Cutters keeps circling back to the idea of women drawing rage from the world and strength from each other, and their own seemingly inexhaustible stores of resilience. That gives the album the sense of a cohesive, coherent statement on the state of the world today that not only enhances the power of all of its songs in isolation, but it also creates a whole greater than the sum of its already considerable parts.

But to boil Bolt Cutters down to that single idea is to miss the richness of what Apple is trying to do. On the album’s title track, the chorus entirely consists of Apple repeating, “Fetch the bolt cutters, I’ve been in here too long.” In the context of the song, it is a general plea to stop the planet because Apple would like to exit the ride, so exhausted is she by a life filled with the petty cruelties humans inflict on each other. But in the context of a pandemic when none of us can leave our houses, it accidentally becomes so much more relevant than it might have in a timeline where we weren’t all stuck inside. (The album was originally scheduled for release in October before Apple argued to release it right now instead. Perhaps she, too, grasped just how relevant it would be.)

Perhaps Apple’s first major entry into the larger mainstream beyond fans of alternative music came in 1997, when she won an MTV Video Music Award for the now-iconic, very ’90s video for “Criminal” (still her biggest hit). Taking the stage to give a speech, she said, “Everybody that’s watching this world? This world is bullshit.” Her use of the word “bullshit” in a program that children could theoretically be watching got more attention than her ultimate message (which was about staying true to your own inner muse), but in 2020, it’s hard to say she was wrong.

I’m so mad, all of the time, and I no longer precisely know who to be mad at. The sources of the pain so many of my fellow humans are forced to suffer seem at once obvious and older than any of us who are still alive. Nothing makes sense, the world is going through the first act of several dozen post-apocalyptic movies at once, and we live in a country with a leadership that does not seem to care about anything other than consolidating power for itself. We are governed by greedy, gluttonous children who are threatened by the mere suggestion that they might be greedy, gluttonous children, and here I am, stuck inside, with no power to do anything about it. What am I going to do? Vote to incrementally dismantle the entire fucking system?

The world is bullshit. Fetch the bolt cutters. I’ve been in here too long.

Fetch the Bolt Cutters is available on all major music platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.

https://www.vox.com/,"It has been clear for some time that the coronavirus pandemic is killing black and Latino Americans at disproportionately high rates, but new data from the last few days reveals just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been for people of color.

Starting in New York City, the American epicenter of the outbreak: Black New Yorkers are dying at twice the rate of their white peers; Latinos in the city are also succumbing to the virus at a much higher rate than white or Asian New Yorkers. The same trends can be seen in infection and hospitalization rates, too.

Mother Jones compiled data from all of the states that break out their coronavirus data by race and ethnicity. The same thing we’re seeing in New York City is happening across the country: Black and Latino Americans get infected with Covid-19 at alarmingly high rates and more are dying than we would expect based on their share of the population.

A few horrifying examples from the charts you can find in the link above:

In Wisconsin, black people represent 6 percent of the population and nearly 40 percent of Covid-19 fatalities

In Louisiana, black people make up 32 percent of the state’s population but almost 60 percent of fatalities

In Kansas, 6 percent of the population is black and yet black people account for more than 30 percent of the Covid-19 deaths

The proportions can change depending on the state, but the trends are consistent anywhere you look: Compared to their share of the population, greater numbers of people of color die than their white neighbors in this pandemic.

Why is that? Well, there are the more acute reasons (black and Latino people are being put at risk more in their day-to-day lives) and then there are the structural reasons (long-standing economic and health disparities between white people and people of color).

On the first, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in NYC is a useful and disturbing example. As the New York Times reported last week, bus and subway workers have been hit hard by the coronavirus: 41 dead and more than 6,000 either diagnosed with Covid-19 or self-quarantining because they have symptoms that suggest an infection, as of April 8.

Who works for the MTA? Black people and Latinos. They account for more than 60 percent of the agency’s workforce in New York City, according to estimates from 2016.

Black people in particular are overrepresented in the MTA; they are 46 percent of the city’s transportation workers versus 24 percent of its overall population. (White people, on the other hand, make up 30 percent of local MTA employees but 43 percent of NYC residents.)

This is, again, true across cities and sectors. As Devan Hawkins wrote in the Guardian, black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be employed in the essential services that have been exempted from state stay-at-home orders, and they are more likely to work in health care and in hospitals. In America as in other countries, health care workers make up a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases.

So the steps states and cities have taken to restrict public activities and slow the spread of the coronavirus, while undoubtedly necessary and productive, have still left people of color more exposed to infection and, ultimately, death during the pandemic.

Those risks are exacerbated by long-standing health inequities in America.

As Fabiola Cineas wrote for Vox last week, black Americans have historically had higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure than white Americans — all of which make a patient more vulnerable to developing a severe case of Covid-19 and ultimately dying.

I would add that they are also more likely to be uninsured, again for both structural reasons (all the states in the Deep South except for Louisiana have refused to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts black people) and because of the immediate crisis (black people were more likely to lose their job in the recent surge in unemployment). The same is true for Latinos.

And those are the macro trends. All over the country, smaller controversies and policy choices also worsen the health of black Americans and weaken their ability to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even something as seemingly simple as clean water to wash hands can be hard to come by for people of color, as this reporting by Khushbu Shah for Vox on Detroit (with 13,000 cases and 1,000 deaths in Wayne County) reveals:

Since 2014, over 140,000 homes in Detroit have had their water service disconnected as part of a debt-payment program, according to records obtained by local news outlet the Bridge. In 2019, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31, had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report). “They put the onus on the customer to have to go in and take affirmative steps [to restore their water], so there are a lot of people who do not know, or secondly, don’t have the ability to go in and meet with someone,” says veteran civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings, who is working to restore water to the city’s most vulnerable. Her daughter, a Detroit teacher and a cancer survivor, is battling coronavirus. Community groups, in the meantime, she said, are passing around five gallons of water to residents who don’t have water for drinking, cooking, or bathing, but Jennings doubts that residents are using the scarce water they have to wash their hands. “If the primary recommendation is ‘wash your hands, continuously, wash your hands,’ and there’s no water in the house to wash your hands,” the number of cases is certain to skyrocket, Jennings says.

For decades — centuries, really — America has failed the black and brown people who call it home. Today, as the coronavirus continues to take its toll, they are stuck paying the price for that failure.

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"San Diego Comic-Con will not take place in 2020, marking the first cancellation of the event in its entire 50-year history.

Comic-Con, the largest fan convention in the US, usually takes place in late July and is an annual pilgrimage for countless fans. But any hopes the festival’s organizers had that the coronavirus pandemic would have subsided by this summer seem to have given way to caution.

In a statement published April 17, the organizers behind the annual pop culture convention announced “with deep regret that there will be no Comic-Con in 2020.” They noted that while they had hoped to delay the decision because so many fans look forward to the annual event and so many exhibitors rely on it for income, “Continuous monitoring of health advisories and recent statements by the Governor of California have made it clear that it would not be safe to move forward with plans for this year.”

Comic-Con will next return to the San Diego Convention Center in July 2021.

Anyone who’d already purchased badges for 2020 will be offered refunds, and those who had already arranged accommodations through the convention’s hotel-booking system will have their reservations automatically canceled and refunded.

San Diego Comic-Con is the latest event to be affected by an ongoing wave of cancellations and postponements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis has impacted cultural events, festivals, and industry gatherings across every sector, but the arts and entertainments sector — which relies heavily on concerts, festivals, and other public events where people gather in large groups — has been hit especially hard. Earlier this week, the Cannes Film Festival, originally tentatively delayed until summer, announced that plans for a summer event had also been placed on indefinite hold. The delays are signs that even if the pandemic subsides sooner rather than later, it may take a long, long time for the entertainment industry to recover.

Comic-Con’s cancellation is an especially severe blow to the city of San Diego, which reaps about $150 million in annual revenue from the event’s 135,000 attendees. As the pandemic continues, however, the convention center is at least being put to good use: Its famous Hall H has been converted into a homeless shelter for those seeking refuge.

https://www.vox.com/,"Welcome to the Vox Book Club’s second week of discussion on N.K. Jemisin’s The City We Became! This week, we’re tackling chapters six through 10, in which we meet Queens, spend some time with Brooklyn, and dive deep into the science fiction and fantasy community’s problem with racism.

As with last week’s discussion, there will be no spoilers for the end of the book in the main post. (Spoilers are allowed in the comments, but be sure to label them clearly to make it easier for folks who want to avoid them.) At the end we’ll provide a few discussion questions that you can use to guide your conversation, either here or in the setting of your choosing, but feel free to talk about whatever in particular piques your interest. And if you want to see me talk about The City We Became face to face (or, well … screen to screen), sign up to receive info about our live Zoom event at the end of the month. It’ll be a blast to see you — especially since we’ll be joined by N.K. Jemisin herself.

In the meantime, we’ve got avatars to analyze and Lovecraftian racism to dismantle. Let’s get to it.

Meet the avatars, continued

At last we meet Queens, avatar of my home borough! In The City We Became, she’s Padmini Prakash, the Math Queen, who loves pure theoretical math but is getting her master’s degree in financial engineering so she has a better shot of obtaining a visa after she graduates. And in the way that Bronca intuitively understands the history of what’s happening with the avatars, Padmini instinctively understands the mechanics of her powers, which work by pure math. Queens is, by some measures, the most diverse place on Earth, and Padmini is the avatar of the borough’s hardworking and ambitious immigrant class.

Like so much else in The City We Became, Padmini reads differently during a pandemic than she would if this book had come out in a different cultural moment. Queens has become the epicenter of New York City’s Covid-19 outbreak, with story after story of horror pouring out of the borough’s Elmhurst Hospital. And in some ways, that’s because of the very diversity and community that The City We Became celebrates.

Queens is a borough of immigrants who disproportionately have working-class jobs. And working-class immigrants are disproportionately less able to work from home, avoid the subway, and participate in other social distancing measures compared with their wealthier, white counterparts. They also have fewer resources to build the infrastructure a community needs to withstand a scourge like this pandemic, and are less likely to have health insurance. Meanwhile, some immigrants are avoiding getting tested for Covid-19 out of fear they’ll be deported under the Trump administration’s “public charge” policy. So right now, Queens is full of people who can’t stay inside, who can’t stay 6 feet away from each other, and who don’t have good access to health care. Queens is struggling.

But Jemisin makes a compelling case that it’s the same demographics making Queens so vulnerable to the pandemic that make it strong and vital in other times, and will enable it to recover once the virus has passed. When Queens works, it works like Padmini’s apartment building: as a place where people look out for each other, in a true and vibrant community.

This section of The City We Became also contains our first Brooklyn POV chapter, during which the avatars take shelter in her townhouse (and which comes after we’ve already spent a fair amount of time seeing Brooklyn through Manny’s eyes). Brooklyn is the only avatar whose borough name is the same as her human name, but she’s still a woman of many identities, all of which fit the shifting form of her home turf. She’s both Brooklyn Thompson, respected city councilwoman, and MC Free, one of the greatest of the early female MCs; both authentic Brooklyn kid (from before it was a borough for rich people) and comfortable new resident who owns not one but two historic brownstone townhouses. Her power comes from her music (you’d think Bronx, as the birthplace of hip-hop, would have had a claim to that superpower, but look, I’m not going to argue with the lady), and yet the Woman in White is still able to hit her where it hurts by going after her real estate.

Aislyn very much does not understand intersectionality

The Woman in White’s fight for Brooklyn is still in progress, but it looks like she’s doing much better in her attempt to talk her way into a foothold on Staten Island. That’s despite the fact that she sends a neo-Nazi into Aislyn’s house to sexually harass her: Aislyn’s disgusted by Conall, sure, but even more than she hates him, she’s afraid of and furious with the avatar for São Paulo.

Aislyn’s essentially being asked to choose between feminism and white supremacy here. As a woman, she knows about oppression: She knows about being harassed and humiliated and afraid and made to feel less than, and it’s within the realm of possibility that she’d decide to push back against her father and ally herself with other oppressed people. But as a white woman, she knows that she is offered a certain protection if she allies herself with white men instead — and she seems to be more and more prepared to do just that, to choose her father and his casual racism and misogyny over her fellow avatars.

The avatars of progressive cosmopolitanism vs. the Sad Puppies of the past

The Woman in White also continues her attempted infiltration of Bronca’s territory when she sends the “Alt Artistes” — a group of alt-right shock artists who want to protest galleries that don’t accept their work — over to the art gallery. What ensues is a critique of the history of science fiction and fantasy from Jemisin, and it’s grounded in very recent events.

The Alt Artistes show Bronca a painting titled “Dangerous Mental Machines,” after one of H.P. Lovecraft’s many disturbing racial epithets for Asian people. The painting itself appears to be dramatizing Lovecraft’s story “The Horror at Red Hook,” in which the immigrant community of Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood is a place of intrinsic squalor and evil that turns out to be a literal portal to hell. When Bronca looks at the painting, she finds herself pulled into Lovecraft’s perspective: She sees the figures looming before her as subhuman threats, horrible and monstrous and certain to destroy her. “This shows you New York as he saw it, the chickenshit little fuck,” she concludes.

Lovecraft is one of the most foundational and important writers in speculative fiction. He was also a vicious racist whose racism is inflected in almost everything he wrote, and the science fiction and fantasy community is still trying to figure out exactly how to grapple with his legacy. In some ways, The City We Became can be read as a dramatization of that struggle. The tentacled monster we saw Manny fight at the beginning of the book — the creature the Woman in White described as one of her “toeholds” — was purely Lovecraftian horror, a tentacle monster beyond human comprehension.

But as we discussed last week, the real monster in The City We Became isn’t the weird crawly thing with tentacles that heroes can pound into submission if they work hard enough. The real monster is reactionary politics, the ideas that Lovecraft brought to his work. That’s what’s hiding in the Alt Artiste painting, and that’s what really makes the Woman in White dangerous. In The City We Became, Lovecraft’s racism is what’s truly evil, while the things Lovecraft feared — the coming together of people of different races, mingling and living and working in one space — become vibrant and powerful and heroic.

The Lovecraft debate is also a microcosm of a fight that’s still alive and well in the science fiction and fantasy community, a fight that’s personal for Jemisin. Jemisin became the only person ever to win three Hugo awards in 2018, when she won her third Hugo for the third and final volume in her Broken Earth trilogy. But Jemisin’s win wasn’t guaranteed. A group of Hugo voters who referred to themselves as the Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies formed a voting bloc specifically to prevent authors from diverse backgrounds, like Jemisin, from winning Hugos, and to instead give the awards to Puppy-endorsed authors who wrote more “traditional” science fiction.

The whole thing developed into a years-long feud that involved both Breitbart and erotica writer Chuck Tingle (for a close look at the controversy, I’ll refer you to Aja Romano’s excellent Vox explainer). But the main point I want to bring home to you here is this: There are people in the science fiction and fantasy community who hate Jemisin, what she writes, and what she represents, so much so that they joined forces specifically to keep her from winning Hugo awards. And then she went on to win more Hugo awards than anyone else in history.

That’s the fight she’s referencing by bringing Lovecraft into this story. What remains to be seen is whether Jemisin’s characters will be as successful as Jemisin herself in pushing back against reactionary art.

https://www.vox.com/,"Share All sharing options for: Scientists warn we may need to live with social distancing for a year or more

Life in America — and in many countries around the world — is changing drastically. We’re physically distanced from our favorite people, we’re avoiding our favorite public places, and many are financially strained or out of work. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating every aspect of life, and we’re already longing for it to end. But this fight may not end for months or a year or even more.

We’re in this because public health experts believe social distancing is the best way to prevent a truly horrific crisis: perhaps hundreds of thousands or more if our health care system is overwhelmed with severe Covid-19 cases, people who require ventilators and ICU beds that are now growing limited in supply.

“Some may look at [the guidelines] ... and say, well, maybe we’ve gone a little bit too far,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, at a Monday White House press conference. “They were well thought out. And the thing that I want to reemphasize ... when you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are.”

How long, then, until we’re no longer behind and are winning the fight against the novel coronavirus? The hard truth is that it may keep infecting people and causing outbreaks until there’s a vaccine or treatment to stop it.

“I think this idea … that if you close schools and shut restaurants for a couple of weeks, you solve the problem and get back to normal life — that’s not what’s going to happen,” says Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion, a book on how outbreaks spread. “The main message that isn’t getting across to a lot of people is just how long we might be in this for.”

As Kucharski, a top expert on this situation, sees it, “this virus is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two, so we need to be thinking on those time scales. There are no good options here. Every scenario you can think of playing out has some really hefty downsides. ... At the moment, it seems the only way to sustainably reduce transmission are really severe unsustainable measures.”

In time, we may learn how to balance the need to “flatten the curve” with the need to live our lives and revive the economy. But for now, it appears we’re in for a long haul.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

Ugh, why?!

The reason we may be in for an extended period of disruption, Kucharski says, is that the main thing that seems to be working right now to fight this pandemic is severe social distancing policies.

Drop those measures — allow people to congregate in big groups again — while the virus is still out there, and it can start new outbreaks that gravely threaten public health, particularly the older and chronically ill people, those most vulnerable to severe illness. “There’s no way [the virus] is going to go away in the next few weeks,” he says.

The way things are looking now, we’ll need something to stop the virus to truly end the threat. That’s either a vaccine (there are some now entering clinical trials but it could be a year before they are approved) or herd immunity. This is when enough people have contracted the virus, and have become immune to it, to slow its spread.

Herd immunity is not guaranteed. Currently it’s unclear if, after a period of months or years, a person can lose their immunity and become reinfected with the virus (which would make achieving herd immunity more difficult). Also, herd immunity will come at the cost of millions of people becoming infected, and possibly millions of people dying.

A new scientific report stresses: Only the most severe distancing measures can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths

A sobering new report from the COVID-19 Response Team at the Imperial College of London underscores the need to keep social distancing measures in place for a long period.

It outlines two scenarios for combating the spread of the outbreak. One is mitigation, which focuses on “slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread.” Another is suppression, “which aims to reverse epidemic growth.”

In their analysis, isolation of confirmed cases and quarantine of older adults without social distancing would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, and an “eight-fold higher peak demand on critical care beds over and above the available surge capacity in both [Great Britain] and the US.”

(Remember, all projections of possible deaths come with uncertainty and are greatly dependent on how we respond. Estimates can change based on variables that are not quite yet understood: like the role kids play in transmitting the virus, and the potential for the virus to show seasonal effects.)

Suppression, which requires “social distancing of the entire population,” can save more lives and prevent hospitals from becoming extremely overburdened. But it needs to be maintained “until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more),” the report states. And it warns “transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.” Make no mistake: Suppression comes at a huge cost to our society, economy, and perhaps even personal well-being.

(Breathes deeply.)

This is not to say social distancing is futile. What Kucharski and the new paper are arguing is that if you lift social distancing and don’t have a strong containment strategy in place to replace it, the virus is just going to cause new outbreaks. This virus is very contagious, with one person infecting 2 to 2.5 others on average without preventive measures. It’s also new, so no one is immune to it. Even in China, it could have a resurgence and infect a huge number of people. This virus can spread before people show symptoms. That’s always going to make it hard to control and detect.

On March 13, the journal Science published an analysis that concludes 86 percent of all the Covid-19 cases in China before January 23 were not at the time detected by public health authorities (though, that doesn’t mean these cases were asymptomatic). It’s estimated these undiagnosed cases infected 79 percent of the total cases. The results suggest that without aggressive testing to confirm cases, Covid-19 will sneak past our best efforts to contain it.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees that the social distancing measures might need to be in place for at least months. “I don’t think people are prepared for that and I am not certain we can bear it,” she writes in an email. “I have no idea what political leaders will decide to do. To me, even if this is needed, it seems unsustainable.” She adds that she might just be feeling pessimistic, but “it’s really hard for me to imagine this country staying home for months.”

President Trump so far has announced guidelines that call for social distancing and other measures for 15 days. When asked at the Monday press conference “how long all of this might last,” he responded, “people are talking about July, August, something like that.”

Can we find a new balance between the need to “flatten the curve” and the need to live our lives and revive the economy?

Given the likelihood of the need for social distancing measures for weeks or months, public health authorities may need to strike a balance: What can they put in place that will prevent a huge wave of deaths but also make life a bit more manageable? Here, greater knowledge about the virus will help. Time will teach us what the right mix of social distancing measures are, health experts tell me.

“The way we deal with the uncertainty is we have to cover all of our bases,” says Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College. “A year from now we’ll realize some of the things that we did may not have been necessary.” But we have to proceed with extreme vigilance due to the unknowns of this virus.

Scientists are still working out which groups of people — and in which locations — are the most likely to transmit the virus. If it turns out that children aren’t playing a big role in transmitting the disease, it could make some sense to reopen schools. Perhaps travel bans, which may prove to be ineffective, will be lifted. People still may be asked to telework, but restaurants may open back up with limited seating.

“Once things get better, we will have to take a step-wise approach toward letting up on these measures and see how things go to prevent things from getting worse again,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and Emerging Leader in Biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

We also don’t know how long we’re in for because we don’t know how bad the outbreak is in the US — due to the lack of testing.

“How are you supposed to implement effective containment measures if you don’t know the actual prevalence in the population? And we still don’t,” Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, says. “That’s unfortunately why I think we need to take these steps, where, if they work, they will be seen as an overreaction. Because if they work, it won’t get worse.”

An aggressive social distancing policy could also become a victim of its own short-term success, Tara Smith, a Kent State epidemiologist, fears. As cases start to come down due to harsh measures, there might be political and economic pressure to lift them prematurely. “Will citizens and our leaders support extended enforced social distancing measures?” she asks. “I’m not sure they will.”

Even though it may seem as though China and South Korea are turning the corner on Covid-19, Kucharski stresses it’s not over. China may be relaxing some of its most stringent social distancing policies and is reopening schools, but the threat remains.

“It would take a few weeks for transmission to take off again,” Kucharski says. “They haven’t solved this. In China they’re still reporting a few [new] cases, which means there’s still virus in the country. If things go back to normal, we’ll be in the situation we were in a month ago, two months ago.”

We can also look, though, to South Korea and China to see what’s working there for long-term mitigation and tailor our strategy. For instance, South Korea has been very aggressive with testing, finding cases, and tracing their contacts, to keep cases declining. “That has proven to be successful so far, from the data we get from South Korea,” says Mauricio Santillana, the director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has been working on modeling the future of the outbreak. Perhaps with more aggressive testing, we could achieve a better balance. “That alternative requires a lot of testing, and our government hasn’t done a good job on that front.”

It’s okay to be upset by all of this. And there are still a lot of unknowns about this virus, and how it will all play out. Perhaps the worst will spare us. But we still need to prepare for it and tap into our resiliency. Life may feel very hard and very stressful over the next several months. It’s a real burden, and you don’t have to like it. But know: This pandemic will end eventually. What we don’t yet know is when.

https://www.vox.com/,"The coronavirus surge is coming, America’s hospitals are struggling to prepare, and the eventual demand for intensive care unit beds for Covid-19 cases could far exceed what US hospitals will be able to provide.

Researchers at the Imperial College London wrote in a devastating new analysis that even stringent mitigation measures of case isolation, home quarantine, and social distancing “would still result in an 8-fold higher peak demand on critical care beds over and above the available surge capacity in ... the US.”

America’s hospitals do not appear ready. Tom Frieden, former CDC director under President Barack Obama, told me that in “any place there is community transmission,” hospitals should cancel elective surgeries so they can make more beds available to Covid-19 patients. Surgeon General Jerome Adams has made a similar plea.

But when Vox asked more than a dozen hospitals in major metro areas across the country where there is community transmission, we found that guidance is not being uniformly adopted. Hospitals are trying to balance the needs of the coronavirus pandemic with the needs of their regular patients, making it more difficult to expand their capacity ahead of a surge in coronavirus cases.

States are starting to take drastic steps to try to increase the number of hospital beds available, but there are limits on what they can do. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he would order the National Guard and building developers to convert existing facilities — dormitories and former nursing homes, for example — into makeshift hospitals. That order is expected to add 9,000 new beds to the 53,000 already available in the state. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a similar order the same day, adding 6,000 beds to the 9,000 existing beds in his state. Governors are urging the Trump administration to get the Army Corps of Engineers and the US military involved to set up temporary hospitals.

Complicating matters further is a shortage of basic medical supplies — masks, gloves, gowns, etc. — that hospital staff need to care for patients and protect themselves. The strain on health care workers will only get worse if nurses and doctors get sick because they lacked protective gear and then are unable to work.

I’ve spoken with nurses at major US hospitals who are certain they have already been exposed to the coronavirus because of these shortages and some lax protocols in the early coronavirus panic.

“We just need supplies,” Melissa Tizon, a spokesperson for the Providence St. Joseph hospital system, which has facilities in Seattle, the worst-hit US city so far, told me. “That’s the main thing we need to care for our patients.”

America has been, from the start, lagging behind in our response to the coronavirus pandemic. The next few weeks, and this test of our ability to dramatically expand US health care capacity, will determine how the outbreak goes from here.

America does not have enough ICU beds for the coronavirus outbreak

America has about 924,000 hospital beds, about 98,000 of which can be used for people who need intensive care, according to the American Hospital Association. The number of Covid-19 cases that will require ICU care could expand far beyond what the US is currently capable of providing.

The Imperial College London projections are just one set of estimates among many (based largely on modeling for influenza outbreaks instead of the current facts on the ground), but they paint a grim picture. The short version is that even the most aggressive mitigation strategies — general social distancing, quarantines, closing schools — will not be enough to prevent US hospitals from being overwhelmed eventually unless we commit to such drastic measures until a vaccine becomes available.

For people 60 and older, between 17 percent and 25 percent of cases are expected to require hospitalization; of those, 25 percent or more will require intensive care (as many as 70 percent for patients 80 and older), according to this analysis. The ability of hospitals to provide that care will be imperative if we are to protect those most vulnerable populations.

Frieden suggested hospitals could, for starters, attempt to turn operating rooms into temporary ICUs. Tizon, with the Providence hospitals in Washington, told me they were running predictive modeling on how many critical cases they can expect and that they are evaluating which other areas of the hospitals could be converted into ICUs.

“We are definitely taking steps to significantly increase our capacity to accommodate a rise in critical care patients,” Mona Locke, a spokesperson for the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, told me. But she acknowledged they were still crunching numbers and could not be more specific: “Everything is fluid.”

Other hospitals told me they were adapting their existing surge capacity plans for the current crisis, but added that an extreme surge in Covid-19 cases would require help from federal and state authorities.

“We have ventilators for our current patients and for our surge plan,” a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center said in an email. “However, like all hospitals, if an extreme surge of patients presents, LAC+USC will depend on external resources from state and federal agencies.”

This is where the steps already being taken in New York and Maryland to set up temporary facilities could be useful. And the US military, though limited practically and legally in what it can do, could help to expand America’s health care capacity, as Vox’s Alex Ward reported:

The military also has thousands of physicians who could help treat patients. Dr. Angela Rasmussen, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University, told me the military could create new hospitals if needed — as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the Army Corps of Engineers to do — or repurpose current ones, for example by converting parts of hospitals into intensive care units.

But it will still be a race to increase hospital beds and ICUs quickly enough to meet the steadily rising number of coronavirus cases here in the US. And at the same time, hospitals must continue to care for the patients they already have.

Hospitals are not uniformly postponing elective surgeries, as public health officials have urged

Frieden told me that hospitals in areas where there is community transmission (which means the virus is spreading naturally among residents, not being brought in from other places) should postpone elective surgeries. Adams made a similar plea on Twitter over the weekend.

Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!



Each elective surgery you do:



1) Brings possible #Coronavirus to your facilities

2) Pulls from PPE stores

3) Taxes personnel who may be needed for #COVIDー19 response https://t.co/WAUTXF5Vyc — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) March 14, 2020

That is easier said than done. While “elective” surgeries might sound like plastic surgery or something less urgent, any procedure that can be scheduled in advance falls under that category. So elective surgeries can include heart surgeries, removing kidney stones, cancer treatments, and more.

That’s why hospitals have bristled at these broad recommendations, asking government leaders to trust them to evaluate their situations and needs. The letter sent over the weekend to the Surgeon General by the major hospital associations explained their position:

We agree that the crisis as it develops may require the curtailment of the least critical or time-sensitive hospital services, but any curtailment must be nuanced to meet the needs of all severely ill patients. Our patients will be best served by carefully evaluating and prioritizing gradients of “elective” care to ensure that the most time-sensitive medically necessary care can be delivered by physicians and hospitals.

Based on Vox’s reporting, hospitals in Covid-19 hotspots are generally making the decision to postpone elective surgeries. The Seattle hospitals I have been in contact with said they were postponing most or all of their elective surgeries with the hope of freeing up their staff and facilities to treat coronavirus patients.

“The decision to postpone elective surgeries will free up staff from operating rooms, and they can hopefully be moved where they are most needed,” Locke at Swedish hospitals in Seattle told me. “This may allow Swedish to admit more medical patients as it decreases surgical patients. This is a delicate balance between the communities’ medical needs and surgical needs.”

Mount Sinai and New York-Presbyterian hospitals in New York City have delayed elective surgeries, as have the George Washington University hospital system in Washington, DC, Massachusetts General in Boston, and the LAC-USC medical system in Los Angeles.

But other hospitals where the virus is now starting to circulate in the community have not yet taken that step. Some hospitals in Denver, Chicago, and DC — all places where there are suspected cases of community transmission — have not postponed elective surgeries, according to their responses to our inquiries and internal communications reviewed by Vox. All of them said they were constantly reviewing their caseloads and the potential need for a delay in those procedures.

These are difficult decisions. One of the paramount public health concerns during a pandemic is how other patients will be affected as resources are taken away from them and directed to the current emergency. But the push and pull on elective surgeries compounds hospitals’ struggles to get ready for the crisis.

US hospitals do not have enough gear for their nurses and doctors

Another huge problem for US hospitals is basic protective gear, particularly masks for health care workers who are interacting with Covid-19 patients, as well as gloves, gowns, and more. I’ve heard that worry from hospitals and nurses, as have other reporters. From BuzzFeed News’s Rosalind Adams:

One of the nation’s top cancer hospitals has informed its staff it has a shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment, even as at least five employees and three patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has only a week’s supply of masks on hand, according to a transcript of a staff meeting last Friday afternoon. The shortage, Kreg Koford, senior vice president of supply chain and sustaining care, told employees, is due to production and distribution delays in China, where most personal protective equipment, or PPE, is manufactured.

As of late last week, Premier Inc., a major supplier to US hospitals, reported it had seen demand for surgical masks double from what they usually see: 55 million versus the typical annual demand of between 22 million and 25 million of the N95 masks that are the standard for health care workers.

“Most hospitals have only a couple weeks of supply,” the company wrote in an update on the supply chain.

Making more masks will be a challenge, as NPR reported: Chinese factories, where many such masks are made, only produce about 600,000 of those masks on average every day due to the difficulty in procuring the necessary materials.

One nurse at a large hospital in a major US city, who asked for anonymity to avoid retribution from their employer, shared with me one concerning story about the mask shortage. A patient was brought into the hospital’s ICU unit; the patient tested negative for flu but did not meet the CDC’s guidelines for coronavirus testing. The nurses were therefore not required to wear a mask when they interacted with the patient after that negative test.

It was later revealed one of the patient’s family members had recently been in Wuhan, China, and been confirmed to have Covid-19. After that information was revealed, then the patient was finally scheduled for a test and masks were used again. But there were several hours in between the negative flu test and the discovery that the patient could be a Covid-19 case when protective gear was not used.

The patient ended up coughing most of the night, potentially exposing nurses and other patients in the ICU ward. Yet even after the nurse gave notice about the potential exposure, their superiors said they could continue to work and did not need to wear a mask “because we’re on shortage.” Nurses were instructed that, even if they had confirmed exposure, they should come into work unless they have symptoms.

“They’re not protecting us. They’re taking away our masks,” the nurse said. “The one thing we are all worried about is we are shedding the virus to the most vulnerable populations.”

The US is trying to ramp up production of medical masks, with the federal government contracting with the company 3M to make tens of millions, but 3M faces the same challenges as Chinese manufacturers: a shortage of raw materials. The Trump administration has also considered, but not yet followed through on, utilizing the Defense Production Act in order to compel private manufacturers to increase their production of these needed supplies.

The entire health system is in a scramble to respond to the Covid-19 outbreak. Perfect processes can’t be expected. But as the scale of the problem becomes apparent, and the virus continues to spread, US hospitals are playing catch-up in a crisis.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"Children and young people are vulnerable to the new coronavirus, but the Covid-19 disease appears to be less severe in children than in some older adults, and scientists aren’t sure why.

This age disparity of severe cases has become a critical question as scientists race to slow the virus’s spread. Some clues to this mystery are starting to emerge, and the answers could help establish what kinds of infection control measures are actually effective, as well as point the way toward treatments.

“We do know that children tend to have more mild infection, have more mild disease, but we have seen [at least one child] die from this infection,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead at the World Health Organization, said in a press conference on March 16. “We can’t say universally that it’s mild in children, so it’s important that we protect children as a vulnerable population.”

In the United States, doctors say they have seen milder symptoms — like a fever and a dry cough — in children among those that have sought treatment than the adults who have.

“At our hospital, Seattle Children’s, we’re a little bit further along in the pandemic; we are not seeing serious disease in children,” said Janet Englund, a professor of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Washington Seattle and a physician at Seattle Children’s Hospital. “For us, it’s relatively indistinguishable from flu, but we can’t tell the difference unless we test, which we can do here.”

Right now, the data on Covid-19’s effects on the young are sparse, but recent studies show that even with children, some groups are more vulnerable than others depending on age and health conditions. Some children with Covid-19 can still experience serious lung disease. Kids with simultaneous respiratory infections can be more vulnerable to Covid-19. Infants without mature immune systems can get sick from the virus. Yet compared to adults, Covid-19 appears to be less severe in most kids.

“I think it is clear that children are not as seriously impacted as older adults,” Englund added.

The twist is that even if they don’t get very sick, young people infected with the virus can transmit it. And the particular concern is that they spread it to someone who might be immunocompromised or otherwise at higher risk. That means epidemic control measures — from proper hand-washing to social distancing — are just as important for the young and healthy as they are for people who are older or sicker.

What we know about the age disparity in severe cases of Covid-19

Countries that have experienced more extensive outbreaks of Covid-19, including China and Italy, have seen the worst impacts of Covid-19 on older adults, with the number of people hospitalized and killed by the disease rising with age. Underlying health problems like high blood pressure, a depressed immune system, and diabetes have also worsened the outcomes among the infected.

However, a small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm.

A study published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association of more than 72,000 infected people in China showed that just 2 percent of the infected in the sample were under the age of 19. Similarly, a February report from the WHO’s mission to China showed that only 2.4 percent of the infected were 18 years old or younger. Out of those infected young people, 2.5 percent developed severe disease and 0.2 percent developed critical disease.

But the WHO report also noted that “it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations).” Which is to say few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isn’t much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, it’s hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young.

Another element is that Covid-19 seems to play out differently in children compared to what health officials have seen with other infections, such as influenza.

Influenza, also caused by a virus that infects the airways, can be a very serious illness in children. Complications from influenza, like a subsequent bacterial pneumonia infection, can be fatal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since September, 144 children have died in the US from influenza in the current season as of March 7. Meanwhile, there have been no reported deaths from Covid-19 among children in the US so far.

“Everything we know about other viral infections would suggest that children are at higher risk” of infection, said Bria Coates, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University and an attending physician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “They don’t tend to wash their hands very well. They don’t give each other space.” Which makes the lower prevalence of severe illness for Covid-19 among children all the more remarkable.

Why the disease varies so much among age groups, especially compared to influenza, remains a mystery. “The reason why children are less affected than adults is potentially a very interesting question,” said Steven Zeichner, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine who studies infectious disease. “I don’t think anybody knows the answer.”

The overall risk to children is low, but infants can experience more severe illness from Covid-19 compared to older children

While children seem less likely to experience severe symptoms of Covid-19 than adults, the risk isn’t zero. A study published March 16 in the journal Pediatrics of more than 2,100 children in China found that children of all ages were vulnerable to Covid-19, though the vast majority experienced mild symptoms, and some experienced none at all. A caveat for this study is that only one-third of the children in the sample were tested and confirmed to have the Covid-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2. The rest were presumptive Covid-19 cases, which means there’s a possibility that another pathogen could have caused the observed symptoms.

Zeichner, who co-authored a commentary article about the findings, noted that the worst outcomes in children were often among infants. The study showed that about 30 percent of childhood Covid-19 cases deemed “severe” and more than half of Covid-19 cases deemed “critical” were among children less than 1 year old. Though the overall numbers were small — 7 infants had critical illness and 33 suffered severe illness — it did show that younger children faced a higher likelihood of more dangerous outcomes.

That higher risk for babies may be because babies are still building up their immune systems. When a baby is born, it retains some infection resistance in the form of antibodies from its mother. That protection wanes over the first few months of life as the baby builds up its own defenses.

“The immune systems in children are not weaker than adults,” Coates said. “Instead, they are untrained.”

However, for a new virus like SARS-CoV-2, there isn’t immunity a mother can pass on, since the mother likely would not have had a chance to be infected with the new virus. There’s also no Covid-19 vaccine right now that can coach a child’s immune system to fight the virus.

At the same time, babies are being exposed to all sorts of environmental stimuli for the first time — bacteria, pollen, dust. To prevent their bodies from overreacting to otherwise harmless things, their immune reactions are tamped down. “In general, infants’ immune systems err on the side of a decreased response to infections,” Coates said.

The results is that infants, particularly in their first year of life, are more vulnerable to dangerous complications from infections. But during the first year, the baby’s immune system matures, becoming more effective at fighting off disease as it learns to identify threats.

Similarly, children who are immunocompromised or have other cardiac, metabolic, or respiratory problems are also at higher risk of complications from Covid-19, just as they would be from other infections.

On the other hand, there may be factors that reduce risks for older children. One hypothesis is that children face more frequent exposure to viruses that are related to SARS-CoV-2 but are much less harmful, so they have some cross-reacting immunity that helps them fight it.

“SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, but it’s far from the only coronavirus that’s out there, and a substantial fraction of the common cold [cases] are caused by other coronaviruses,” Zeichner said. Children may be exposed to these viruses more frequently than adults at school and in playgroups, which may be helping their immune systems detect and fight off the new virus.

Another hypothesis is that the immune system in children is less likely to overreact to an invader, according to Coates. Many of the older people who were hospitalized by Covid-19 suffered from severe inflammation and fever, immune responses that ended up causing more damage than the virus itself. With a lower risk of severe immune response, children experience milder symptoms.

Right now these ideas are just hypotheses with scant evidence to back them up. But figuring out why Covid-19 is playing out this way could yield dividends for everyone. “If you could find out why children are protected, you could use that information to devise a strategy to protect adults,” Coates said.

What is the best strategy to protect children from Covid-19?

Preventing infections is the best way to protect everyone, regardless of age. Hand-washing, for instance, remains an important tactic for young and old alike to control the spread of the coronavirus.

But across the country, schools, colleges, offices, and sporting events have all been shut down to limit the spread of the infection. Canceling gatherings is a key component of social distancing, the practice of limiting exposure to other people to control the spread of the virus. Many schools have no scheduled date to resume.

However, school closures come with trade-offs, including for public health. Schools are also the main source of food for many students, and the supervision they provide allows the parents of children to go to work.

Some researchers also question the effectiveness of such measures in protecting children. “From the evidence that we are seeing, we are not seeing transmission in settings like schools where we would worry about amplification of transmission,” said the WHO’s Van Kerkhove.

As Vox’s Anna North has reported, inconsistent guidelines for school closures are also undermining their effectiveness:

The CDC has said that school closures of under four weeks likely will not have a meaningful effect on the spread of the virus. In fact, the CDC is somewhat equivocal on whether school closures are effective at all, stating that closures of 8 to 20 weeks may have some effect, but that other interventions like hand-washing and isolation are more effective, according to the Washington Post.

However, other experts argue that now is exactly the time to pursue such drastic measures. “I think we’re at the very beginning of [a potentially] exponentially increasing problem, and if you want to get ahead of an exponentially increasing problem, you have to intervene at the beginning,” Zeichner said.

Coates agreed. “I think that closing schools is a very effective way of stopping transmission of infectious diseases,” she said.

Experts are also divided on continuing smaller gatherings of children like play dates amid the outbreak.

Zeichner also emphasized keeping kids current with their vaccinations and making sure they get regular flu shots. While the influenza vaccine can’t prevent Covid-19, it can prevent influenza, which in turn reduces the stress on the health care system, and on families.

And if you suspect your child may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the best thing to do is to call your doctor for advice. Seattle Children’s Englund said that parents should seek medical attention if they notice their children are having difficulty breathing — wheezing, persistent coughing, breathlessness, and difficulty talking. “If the child is having trouble breathing, they certainly need to be seen urgently,” she said.

But ultimately, some degree of exposure is inevitable, among children and between children and adults. “It’s hard to conduct a program of social distancing with your toddler,” Zeichner said.",2

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s easy to forget that just a few months ago, the virus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic around the world was not known, at all, to science.

In the months and weeks since, researchers have been learning as much as they can about this pathogen — and at breakneck speed. Scientists have sequenced its genome and begun to create vaccines in the hope of making people immune to it. They’ve also learned, critically, that people can pass the virus on to others before they get symptoms themselves. That makes the virus hard to contain. But it also makes it clear that severe actions — like the social distancing measures in place in the US and around the world — are necessary in the fight to save lives.

We still don’t know how this pandemic will play out. That’s in large part because there are crucial unanswered questions about this virus and the disease it causes. For example, researchers don’t yet have precise estimates of how deadly the virus is or an exact understanding of how it spreads. The answers to these questions will provide key insights into stopping this pandemic in the least disruptive way possible.

Related Scientists warn we may need to live with social distancing for a year or more

It may be too easy to look at these uncertainties and the lack of data and feel cavalier: Maybe this all isn’t as bad as people are saying.

Do not take comfort in these uncertainties. Take caution.

“The way we deal with the uncertainty is we have to cover all of our bases,” Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College. “A year from now we’ll realize some of the things that we did may not have been necessary.” But we have to proceed with extreme vigilance due to the many unknowns of this virus and the serious risk it poses to so many around the globe.

These are the nine most important unanswered questions about Covid-19 that will help determine the course of this outbreak. Be humbled by this list. We are. And take care.

1) How, exactly, does Covid-19 spread?

The virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — that causes Covid-19 has infected more than 222,000 people since its emergence. (Of them, at least 9,000 have died.) That’s just the confirmed cases. A great many more may have occurred (more on that later).

Why has it spread so fast? “The best explanation for this rapid spread is that the virus is being passed through droplets from coughing or sneezing,” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. “When these virus-laden droplets from an infected person reach the nose, eyes, or mouth of another, they can transmit the disease.”

But it’s still unknown how significant other modes of transmission are in spreading the disease.

It’s possible that the virus can spread through feces. (The CDC says, though, “the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses.” But if you weren’t already washing your hands vigorously after defecating, please do so now.). There are also uncertainties over how long the virus can linger in the air after a person coughs or sneezes.

You may have heard that the new coronavirus isn’t “airborne” — meaning that unlike extremely contagious diseases like measles, it’s unlikely to linger in the air for hours on end. But that doesn’t mean the virus can’t linger in the air for some amount of time.

As Wired explains, although some experts say the new coronavirus isn’t airborne, that’s based on a narrow scientific definition of the term. The virus can possibly still linger in the air for some time and under some conditions. As the journal Stat reports, we don’t yet know precisely what those conditions are. It will definitely be in the air in the moments after an infected person sneezes or coughs, but it’s unclear when the particles eventually come to rest on the ground (or surrounding surfaces).

“The studies suggesting that [the virus] can be aerosolized [i.e., linger as small particles in the air] are only preliminary, and other research contradicts it, finding no aerosolized coronavirus particles in the hospital rooms of Covid-19 patients,” Stat reports. More research is needed.

So all three transmission routes — droplets, airborne, and fecal — are still possible contributors to the spread of the virus. “Almost certainly, one of these is probably the predominant one, and the others might be minor modes of transmission, but we don’t really understand this,” Hotez says. Some good news is that scientists are figuring out how long the virus can live on some surfaces. Here’s the latest: It’s around three days for plastic and steel, about a day for cardboard, and less than a day for copper. This information helps direct sanitation efforts to where they are needed most.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

2) Can people become reinfected? And, if so, after how long?

Another huge unknown: Can people become reinfected with Covid-19 after they’ve had it? There are some reports of people in China and Japan testing positive after recovering from the infection. Though, to be clear, it’s unknown whether those people were truly reinfected or still just had low levels of the virus in their systems after they felt better.

“I would say that the biggest unknown is how potent is the immune response generated in an infected person,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, writes in an email. “How long would [immune] protection last? ... The answers to these questions are key to understanding whether herd immunity is effective.“

Herd immunity is when enough people have contracted the virus and become immune that its spread can be slowed and potentially stopped. If reinfection is possible, however, herd immunity may not be an option. (Also, stopping the virus via herd immunity is not an ideal scenario. It would first mean millions upon millions of infections and potentially millions of deaths.)

Right now, there’s limited research on the question of reinfection in humans. It’s just too early. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, points to a hopeful, if small, study in Macaque monkeys. The monkeys had been infected with the virus and then, after they got better, exposed again to the virus. Good news: They didn’t get reinfected. The study, Rasmussen says, “bodes well for vaccine development, because that suggests the virus — or viral proteins — can elicit an immune response,” and protect monkeys at least from reinfection.

Studies on humans will come in time. Researchers will be able to test the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the weeks and months following their infection and see if they still are immune.

But even if people do become immune, “one thing we don’t know about that still is how long that immunity would last,” Rasmussen says. “And that’s unfortunately not something we can determine until we wait months or years in the future, and test again and see if those antibodies are still there.”

For coronaviruses that cause the common cold (in the same family of viruses as the one that causes Covid-19), she says, reinfection is possible, but on a timescale of years, not weeks or months. Again, we’re going to have to wait and see if this also applies to Covid-19.

For now, at least, Rasmussen says, “I have not seen any data that is convincing that reinfection occurs.”

3) How many cases of Covid-19 are in the US, and where are we on the curve?

This is one of the scariest unknowns. Due to the continued lack of Covid-19 diagnostic testing in most of the US, we just don’t know how many cases are in the US.

“There’s speculation that there may be many mild infections who aren’t seeking care — or, even if they are, can’t be tested due to insufficient testing capacity,” says Harvard epidemiologist Maimuna Majumder. This obfuscates our knowledge of where the virus is, and how many vulnerable people may be in its path.

Repeating my plea to media: PLEASE stop saying ""there are now X number of cases in the US"" and start saying ""as of today X cases have been reported in the US. Because of limited testing, experts agree the real number is far higher."" We don't know how much higher but many times — Marc Lipsitch (@mlipsitch) March 15, 2020

As of March 19, the CDC said there were 10,442 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US. But viral genetic data suggests the real number could be much higher. Here is one estimate from a computational virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle (with a very wide range) from nearly a week ago;

I could easily be off 2-fold in either direction, but my best guess is that we're currently in the 10,000 to 40,000 range nationally. 11/13 — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 14, 2020

Another problem with insufficient testing is that we don't know where we are on the epidemic curve. How do we know when the worst spikes in the number of cases are coming? It seems we’re early, but we don’t know how early or how big the wave of future cases is. We need to know this to make sure hospitals are prepared for a surge of patients.

If we know how many people are getting the disease without symptoms or getting it at a level that does not warrant medical attention, scientists can make better estimates for how deadly the virus is and for whom, and they can refine their assumptions about how contagious the virus is. More testing can also help researchers determine the true role asymptomatic transmission plays in the outbreak, and what factors make a person likely to transmit the virus before they feel sick.

4) How deadly, exactly, is Covid-19?

Knowing the true number of infections that exist in the US or around the globe (or at least getting a better estimate of the true number) will help researchers determine another crucial metric about Covid-19: its case fatality rate, meaning how deadly it is.

Right now, it’s looking like some countries have higher death rates for Covid-19 than others. These rates also keep changing. Now, the estimated death rate for Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak began — is 1.4 percent, per a new study in Nature Medicine. In late February, the World Health Organization estimated the rate in Wuhan was 5.8 percent. South Korea, on the other hand, was estimated to have a death rate of less than 1 percent. Italy’s seems to be, for now, several percentage points higher.

Are these estimates different because the citizens of these countries are at different levels of risk for some yet-to-be-determined variables? Are their caregivers better at treating the virus? Or are their health care systems falling short in the testing of cases? All of these questions may be in play.

It’s also the case that the fatality rate can change over time, as Belluz explains:

CFRs do change over time. That’s exactly what happened in China, as you can see in this figure from the WHO. Even the first and hardest-hit province, Hubei, saw its death rate tumble as public health measures were strengthened and clinicians got better at identifying and treating people with the disease:

Crucially, it’s not just the overall CFR that matters but also the knowledge of who is most at risk for death. It does seem clear that older people — particularly those older than 80 — and those with chronic medical conditions are in the riskiest group for dying of Covid-19. But we need more knowledge on other subgroups so we can better protect them.

5) Is it seasonal?

For a variety of reasons, some viruses — but not all — become less transmissible as temperatures and humidity rise in the summer months. The viruses themselves may not live as long on surfaces in these conditions. The droplets that transmit the virus also may not spread as far in humid air. (When the air contains more water vapor, those virus droplets will collide with water molecules more frequently and may not travel as far. The humid air is kind of like a shield for virus-containing droplets.) Also, human behavior changes, and we spend less time in confined spaces.

“A lot of how the outbreak ends or at least how things progress in the next few months really depends on if this is seasonal,” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, says.

There are actually two important questions here. The first: Will Covid-19 show seasonal effects? The second: Will those seasonal effects make a meaningful difference in slowing down the spread of the pandemic?

The answer to the first question, right now, is maybe.

Mauricio Santillana, the director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, has been studying the potential seasonality of Covid-19 by looking at the best available data from China.

Before China instituted massive lockdowns, “we saw a signature that places that were colder and drier showed slightly larger transmissions before interventions,” Santillana says. Though he admits the data is limited, and it’s hard to analyze the exact impact temperature and humidity have on transmission. That’s because, once China locked down, it became hard to disentangle the effects weather has on transmission from the mitigation policies from the government. Santillana and his colleagues are still working out what exact effect the weather may have on transmissibility, and he says it’s too soon to report a specific number.

But be prepared to be disappointed on this. On the second question, Santillana is firmer: “We cannot rely on weather alone to take care of the outbreak,” he says, pointing to warmer and more humid climates — like in Singapore — where the virus has spread. “We think the spring temperatures will not be enough to mitigate the outbreak.”

It’s just too contagious — and too few people are immune.

That said, it’s not futile to keep studying seasonality effects. “This virus may be with us for the coming years,” Santillana says. Predicting spikes based on weather, however small, will give us “a more precise way to deploy resources around the world.”

6) What role do children play in the spread of Covid-19? And why aren’t they getting very sick with it?

“When there’s an influenza epidemic, kids are often some of the biggest community spreaders,” Hotez explains.

But with Covid-19, kids generally don’t seem to be getting severely ill. Which is leading researchers to ask: Are kids a big source of transmission of this virus? “When we’re talking about closing schools, we’re doing that under the assumption that kids are significant community transmitters,” Hotez says. “If we knew that one way or another, we could make a more informed decision.”

On this, the data is slowly coming in.

“We do know that children tend to have more mild infection, have more mild disease, but we have seen [at least one child] die from this infection,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead at the World Health Organization, said in a press conference on March 16. “We can’t say universally that it’s mild in children, so it’s important that we protect children as a vulnerable population.”

While kids usually seem to be spared the worst, so many questions remain, as Vox’s Umair Irfan explains: “A small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm,” he writes. “Few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isn’t much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, it’s hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young.”

7) What leads some people to be at higher risk for the worst symptoms of Covid-19?

On the question of risk factors, there seems to be one clear answer for the most prominent factor: age. Older people appear to be dying in much higher numbers from Covid-19 than younger people.

But we still don’t know a lot about what else contributes to risk. Even among older people, there are unanswered questions. Like why do men appear to be dying at higher rates than women?

Though the risks to older people are being emphasized, young people are also being hospitalized. New data from the CDC now shows that while Covid-19 is currently less than 1 percent fatal among those ages 20 to 54, this group makes up 38 percent of the hospitalizations so far (with 20 percent of the hospitalization occurring among those ages 22 to 44).

“It’s really an open question to try to figure out why some of these younger people are getting really, really severe disease, and if there are other risk factors that we are not appreciating,” Rasmussen says. “Some of that will just have to wait until we have really detailed clinical data on all the cases that are coming out now in Italy and in the United States.” Knowing who is most at risk, she says, “will help in terms of flattening the curve.” If we learn how to protect the young people most at risk and keep them out of hospitals, we can decrease strain on our health care system.

And a big part of keeping the health care system working well is ensuring its workers — who are often in this 20- to 54-year-old group — remain healthy. “We don’t understand why hospital workers also seem to be at higher risk for severe disease than you would expect based on their age,” Hotez says. “Is it just that they get exposed to a large dose of the virus? Do they have some type of susceptibility that we don’t understand?”

Currently, we don’t know.

8) How, exactly, did it start?

This is still a little bit of a mystery. Scientists know this virus jumped from an animal to a human, but they are not sure exactly how or where. “If you don’t understand where it came from, then it’s hard to make policies, procedures, to prevent it from happening again,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and Emerging Leader in Biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

It likely started with a bat — the genetics of the novel coronavirus suggest that it did. As Vox’s Eliza Barclay reported:

What researchers have to figure out now is how exactly the coronavirus jumped to humans: perhaps through a human eating an infected animal, or through humans being exposed to infected feces or urine. “All we know [is] its likely distant source was bats, but we don’t know who was between bats and people,” said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia and host of the This Week in Virology podcast. “It could be a direct infection [between bats and humans] as well.”

A lot of the evidence points toward the outbreak either starting or significantly gaining steam at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The more we know about how this virus made the jump from animals to humans, the more authorities can help make sure an outbreak with this origin doesn’t happen again.

9) When will it end? And how? Will it become endemic?

The response to the Covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating every aspect of life, and we’re already longing for it to end. But this fight may not end for months or a year or even more. It’s also possible that Covid-19 will become endemic, meaning it becomes a disease that regularly infects humans and never really goes away.

But there are so many unknowns that will determine how long we have to live with this:

Could a pharmaceutical treatment emerge that will prevent people from dying from Covid-19? (Many drugs, including HIV-fighting antivirals, and common, cheap ones — like those to ward off malaria — are being tested right now, or may be tested soon.)

Will one of the many vaccine formulations that have been created in recent weeks (some of those trials are already underway) prove to be safe and effective?

If no drug works to treat the virus or stop its spread, we may need to live with strict social distancing for many months, if not a year or more, to prevent hundreds of thousands from dying. Will governments support that level of sustained disruption to the economy? Or could we find an alternative, like aggressive testing coupled with relentless contact tracing, quarantines of those exposed, and isolation of the sick?

As we learn more about this disease, our approach to fighting it will become more precise. We may be able to find a balance between protecting the vulnerable and letting our economy and society function again. But for now, we have to confront the possibility that this virus will disrupt life for a long while.

“I think this idea … that if you close schools and shut restaurants for a couple of weeks, you solve the problem and get back to normal life — that’s not what’s going to happen,” says Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion, a book on how outbreaks spread. “The main message that isn’t getting across to a lot of people is just how long we might be in this for.”

But given that scientists have only known about this virus for a few short months, “it’s actually quite remarkable how much we’ve learned,” Hotez says. “We’ve learned more information about this virus in this short period of time than any other virus.”

The learning won’t stop. And because of that, hopefully, the spread of this pandemic someday will.",2

A major coronavirus epidemic in the US was always likely to require some social distancing. But experts say that failures in coronavirus testing and Covid-19 surveillance in general have exacerbated the country’s need for and reliance on social distancing — making it all the more important for individuals to get this right and follow best practices.

“Without surveillance, we don’t even know where to look,” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at Yale University, told me. “We don’t even know where to employ self-isolation or social distancing. So now we’re stuck in this situation where it’s pretty much everywhere, and so we have to apply these methods across the board.”

Over the next few months, Americans are going to have to spend a lot more time at home. They’ll have to avoid bars, restaurants, and large social gatherings. In fact, they probably won’t even have the option to go to those places, as events across the country get canceled, restaurants temporarily close, and workplaces shut down their offices and tell employees to work from home. Experts say this will likely be needed not for days or weeks, but months.

Yet we still don’t know how extensive Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, is across America. As President Donald Trump’s administration has failed to roll out widespread and accessible testing, America has lagged behind its peers in the amount of tests being done. So even though there are more than 10,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US as of March 19, experts and officials caution that there could, in reality, be five, 10, even 50 times more than that — we just don’t know. And we don’t really know where the worst outbreaks are happening and which areas are most vulnerable.

That means some of the crucial public health tools we should have to fight a pandemic — surveillance, contact tracing, and targeted quarantines — just aren’t currently available. So we’re now all-in on social distancing to stop the spread of Covid-19.

It’s in this context that Americans are being asked to stop physical contact with as many people as possible. Since we don’t know who has Covid-19 and which communities are at greatest risk, it’s best to play it safe and physically isolate everyone. The goal here is to “flatten the curve” — to spread out the spread of coronavirus to avoid overwhelming health care systems. We need to do this until scientists develop a vaccine, which could take as long as 18 months, or until the outbreak stops by other means.

“Had we been more on top of testing, maybe we wouldn’t have had to be quite so extreme,” Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at New York University, told me. “Because we still have a [testing] shortage, we still have to have some way of dividing people who are infectious from people who are susceptible. Right now, in the absence of testing, you really have to do the social-distancing thing to the extreme.”

That doesn’t mean we wouldn’t still be practicing social distancing if we had better testing and surveillance. With a large disease outbreak, there was always bound to be some level of social distancing. But perhaps it would be more limited, more targeted, and — crucially — less open-ended. And maybe we wouldn’t be relying on social distancing quite as much to prevent potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of Covid-19 deaths, though experts caution it may be too late to change course on social distancing now.

“There’s just so much virus transmission happening around the world,” Grubaugh said. “Eventually, you would have had enough introductions happen that you would have sustained transmission in the US like we do now.” And that would require at least some social distancing no matter what, he added.

In an optimistic scenario, some experts said better surveillance could allow more limited social distancing in the future, at least temporarily. Testing can cut down on how long we need to social distance, since surveillance can help get outbreaks under control quicker. Schools might reopen and close only when early warning signs of the disease pop up locally, rather than as a blanket precautionary move. Smaller gatherings could be tolerated, or restaurants and other businesses could stay open, albeit in a limited capacity. But it’s hard to say, given all of the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19.

“Maybe that’s a way to be hopeful about how this could play out,” Gounder said.

But that requires a surveillance system robust enough that people could trust that the lack of cases means there really is little risk. The US is, at best, weeks away from achieving that. And that means it’s on all of us, at least for now, to social distance.

Better surveillance could reduce how much social distancing we need

In an ideal world, America would have widespread testing available for, at the very least, anyone who has symptoms of Covid-19. This would not only let those people get medical care and allow officials and experts to track who has the disease and where, but it would also enable contact tracing, which is when all of the people a sick person came into contact with are found and asked to go into self-quarantine as a precaution. This is all a crucial part of containing and even stopping a disease outbreak, especially during its early stages.

That did not happen in the US with Covid-19. First, the Trump administration refused to use the tests deployed by other countries and offered by the World Health Organization, seemingly out of concern that those tests weren’t accurate enough. Secondly, the homemade test the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went with had technical problems, leading to further delays in getting widespread testing off the ground. Finally, a series of political, technical, and bureaucratic issues in recent weeks have further stalled testing, even as the Trump administration has promised “millions” of tests.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

So several weeks after the first community transmission within the US, the country had tested fewer than 28,000 people as of March 15, according to the Covid Tracking Project. In comparison, South Korea had tested more than 66,000 people within a week of its first case of community transmission. As a result, US cases have flown under the radar, including in Washington state, where the coronavirus may have gone undetected for weeks in what’s now, as far as we know, the second-worst outbreak in the country.

“We know that there likely are unrecognized hotspots, that there are people transmitting with mild infections,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. “But we don’t know, technically, where they are. We don’t know how many cases we have. We know the number of confirmed cases is an underestimate, but we don’t know how much of an underestimate it is.”

The situation appears to be getting better as public and private labs finally scale up how much testing they can do. But experts caution this could take weeks or months — meaning we could be in the dark for a while, at a time when Covid-19 is spreading so rapidly that confirmed cases have been doubling within days.

In lieu of all this uncertainty, the public health motto is that it’s better to be safe than sorry. So people are being asked to do social distancing — which really means physically isolating themselves as much as possible. (Vox has a good guide on the rules of social distancing.)

“You’re left with this inability to do that kind of aggressive case finding and isolation,” Adalja said. “So what we’re doing is social distancing.”

Even if we scaled up testing, though, chances are we would still have to do a lot of social distancing. And it’s possible, even likely, that any future easing of social distancing as a result of better surveillance could be only temporary.

For example, Covid-19 may come back in waves, especially as we soften social-distancing measures and give the virus a chance to return while people still lack immunity. When that does happen, though, it’s also possible that better surveillance and more familiarity with the disease will limit what social-distancing measures are needed.

“The next round of social distancing will be activated more rapidly, because officials — and the public — will be more prepared,” doctors Ezekiel Emanuel, Susan Ellenberg, and Michael Levy wrote in the New York Times. “It should also be shorter, because we can assume that most of the people who were initially infected are likely to be immune next time around. But it will still disrupt people’s lives and the economy. We will still have canceled conferences and sporting events. People will not frequent restaurants and will not travel. The service industry will be severely curtailed. And it’s going to happen again and again.”

The idea here is to get to the point of South Korea, where very aggressive testing — up to 15,000 tests a day in a nation one-sixth as populous the US — and social distancing have let the country slow the spread of the coronavirus. That doesn’t mean South Korea is totally in the clear now; cases are still rising, and just like every other country, it will remain vulnerable to the disease until vaccines or other treatments are developed. But at least the light at the end of the tunnel is more visible.

At this point, we have to do social distancing. Millions of lives are at stake.

Regardless of how we got to this point, the experts I spoke to for this story reiterated one thing: We need to take social distancing seriously now — to protect not only ourselves but also everyone around us.

This isn’t going to be fun. It’s going to mean not having friends over, skipping parties, and cancelling reservations at favorite restaurants. Anything that isn’t truly essential has to go. Most people are social creatures, making this a real sacrifice for the majority.

There are also more serious consequences to social-distancing protocols. For people whose jobs don’t let them work from home, not showing up to the office — whether because they’re sick or their employer shut down — will cost them income and possibly health insurance. That will create a powerful incentive for people to go to work even if they’re experiencing symptoms. It’s largely up to employers and policymakers to make up for the loss of income with paid sick leave, food stamps, or even extra cash.

Unfortunately, we also don’t know how long this will be necessary. Nobody I spoke to believed it would only take a couple weeks, instead pointing to at least two months. There’s a good chance it could be necessary even beyond then — though whether it’s a year or 18 months of nonstop social distancing, or perhaps waves of social distancing every few months, is unclear.

“I don’t think anybody knows the answer to this now because we don’t know the trajectory of this outbreak in the United States,” Adalja said.

That’s partly a result of the lack of testing and surveillance, which makes it hard to track when diseases rise and fall. But it’s also a result of the fact that this disease is new, so we don’t know how it works, how long outbreaks typically last, or even if people necessarily develop lifelong immunity to it. (Several experts worry Covid-19 could become endemic and, similar to the flu, regularly come back in the future.)

In short, there’s a lot of unknowns. But that’s one reason why we need social distancing now: Without a concrete idea of just how bad this could all get, experts argue it’s better to take precautions instead of potentially letting things get bad — and letting people die — before we do anything.

The question is if people will stick to it.

Some experts said they’re hopeful that people will learn to adapt. People will learn to play board games online instead of in person. There will be happy hours over Skype or Zoom. There will be movie sessions over the phone or by text or Facebook messaging rather than in the same living room or theater. Things that may have seemed awkward before will now become necessary to maintain social interactions and relationships.

“We need to be creative about how we approach this,” Gounder said.

And maybe, as the reality of the pandemic settles in, people will realize this is something they just have to do.

But some experts also worry that a lot of people will let up and disobey the rules of social distancing, especially as it drags on for months and months.

“I don’t think people are prepared for that and I am not certain we can bear it,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, previously told Vox. “I have no idea what political leaders will decide to do. To me, even if this is needed, it seems unsustainable.” She added that while she may just be feeling pessimistic, “it’s really hard ... to imagine this country staying home for months.”

In particular, experts worry that many Americans, still feeling healthy and mostly unaffected by Covid-19, will simply shrug off concerns about the virus. There’s a chance they’ll only start cutting back on their activities and socializing once the outbreak is visible to them, even though the whole point of social distancing is to prevent the outbreak from getting worse and more visible to people. In other words, a lot of people may react too slowly, potentially leading to hundreds of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths.

Social distancing could also be a victim of its own success: Officials and the public could see cases drop as a result of such measures and prematurely ease restrictions, only for Covid-19 cases to increase again. Epidemiological models back up such concerns, showing that pulling back on social distancing could lead to a spike in infections.

“It’s the paradox of public health: When you do it right, nothing happens,” Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, told me. “It’s when we have those breaks in public health where people do go out to parties … and somebody gets infected.”

The consequences here would be dire. Every single point of contact risks spreading the disease. If one person infects two or three others (as seems to be the case, on average, with unabated coronavirus), those people could infect two or three more, and so on and so on. One slip-up could lead to dozens, if not hundreds, of infections down the line; in South Korea, one person was reportedly the initial source for more than 1,000 new infections.

The flip side is that if we do this right, we could avert potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths. If that feels abstract, experts advise thinking of it in more concrete terms: People you know today might be alive next year only if we all take social distancing seriously. In the absence of better surveillance, that’s what we’re relying on — almost entirely — for now.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"Here’s a big, discomforting fact about the current coronavirus outbreak in the United States: We have no idea how large it is.

We don’t know because the US has been extremely slow to roll out diagnostic testing for the Covid-19 disease. It’s unclear if there’s a specific policy or decision to blame for the current situation. It arose from a combination of manufacturing problems, chronic underfunding, and an apparent lack of foresight. But no matter the specific reason, the testing challenges, scientists tell us, make us less prepared to deal with this unfolding public health crisis that will probably get worse before it gets better.

“I think that we could have probably controlled this, if we had effective testing,” Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, says.

Accurate testing is critical to stopping an outbreak: When one person gets a confirmed diagnosis, they can be put in isolation where they won’t spread the disease further. Then their contacts can be identified and put into quarantine — so that they don’t spread the virus if they’ve become infected, too. That’s particularly important for a virus like this one, which seems able to spread before people show symptoms, or when their symptoms are mild.

Better testing, paired with aggressive public health actions — like social distancing, isolation of those who are sick, and tracing those who sick people made contact with — can still help save lives in the United States.

But it starts with testing. To date, per an investigation in the Atlantic, fewer than 2,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in the US — a number far behind other developed countries. South Korea, for example, has tested more than 140,000 people and has even set up drive-though testing stations for people to access.

Evidence is mounting that early in the outbreak, in January and February, China bought the world time with its aggressive action to contain the viral outbreak in its borders. The testing fiasco in the US indicates we didn’t use that time well.

“There was clear lack of foresight,” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, says. “We were very slow to roll out testing capacity to individual places — wherever that came from, it was a very bad strategy.”

The testing has been really slow to start

There’s no one reason the testing effort has been so slow. There seem to be bureaucratic, scientific, and economic drivers for the debacle.

Here’s where the trouble started. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started sending out test kits to laboratories the first week of February, a month after China announced the outbreak. But the health agency quickly encountered a problem.

Some labs reported to the CDC that some of the test kits were delivering inconclusive results during verification. It’s believed that one of the chemicals used to conduct the test was not working properly and needed to be remanufactured.

“I’m very puzzled by what’s happened. The CDC did a really good job with H1N1 and Zika in exactly this thing: sending out huge quantities of test kits very rapidly to every state in the US and more than 100 countries around the world,” Tom Frieden, who led the CDC under President Barack Obama, told Vox. “The world came to rely on the CDC.”

The tests are conducted via mouth or throat swabs, through the testing of mucus that has been coughed up or fluid from a patient’s trachea. They’re designed to identify the virus’s specific genetic signature, and results have to be shipped to labs, where they take a day to process.

Also, at first, the testing was bottlenecked. Most states had to send their samples to the CDC until March 2, and so, to the frustration of state health officials, precious time was lost shipping materials to Atlanta in those critical first few weeks. What’s more, each test required lengthy phone calls with the CDC, Rachel Levine, who leads the Pennsylvania health department, told Vox. As of February 25, only 12 labs across the country — in just five states — had the ability to test.

Now that states can perform their own tests, they are able to turn them around in a matter of hours. “It’s a much more efficient mechanism,” Levine said, “but it took a long time for that to happen.”

In Seattle, currently the US city with the most Covid-19 cases, local researchers were so exasperated by the CDC’s initial faulty test that they came up with their own, as STAT’s Helen Branswell reported:

Frustrated by the lack of testing resulting from the problem with the CDC-developed kit, the Seattle Flu Study began using an in-house developed test to look for Covid-19 in samples from people who had flu-like symptoms but who had tested negative for flu.

That testing was vital for Washington state, as it led to more clues about how the disease was spreading there. Genetic detective work from Washington suggests the virus has been circulating there for at least six weeks. Modeling suggests there could be 500 to 600 cases of Covid-19 in the Seattle area, as STAT reports.

So there’s been human error. But it’s also important to know that the work of setting up testing for a new virus can be difficult. Laurie Garrett, the science journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the Ebola outbreak in 1995, said China’s most-used tests have had false negatives nearly half the time.

This is true. I want to be clear that I’m not blaming individuals at CDC or health departments for the testing debacles. This is absolutely the fault of our neglected public health infrastructure. https://t.co/Jp0l2fnrQv — Dr. Angela Rasmussen (@angie_rasmussen) March 6, 2020

“Everybody is having trouble with the sensitivity/specificity issues” with the coronavirus, Garrett said. But the slow start to testing in America, compounded by the problematic test kits that were first sent out into the field, has set back the US response.

“I have no criticisms for the scientists at the CDC who developed the test because sometimes tests just don’t work,” Rasmussen says. But she does mention it’s problematic that the CDC has removed data about the number of people tested in the United States from its website, saying it didn’t want there to be discrepancies with state testing numbers. “In my view, the biggest scandal is that sort of response.”

Now that we have a functional test, it’s still not reaching enough people

Vice President Mike Pence and other top Trump administration officials have been promising to ramp up the country’s capacity to test for coronavirus, but they have failed to meet their goals.

As Bloomberg reported this week, senators were told in a CDC briefing that the Trump administration would not be ready to roll out the 1.5 million kits it had promised by the end of this week. The number would be fewer than 500,000, it appeared.

The Atlantic has provided the best accounting of how many tests have actually been conducted in the United States so far: fewer than 2,000, according to its survey of state health officials and other sources. That puts the US far behind some of its economic peers with much smaller populations:

The figures we gathered suggest that the American response to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has been shockingly sluggish, especially compared with that of other developed countries. The CDC confirmed eight days ago that the virus was in community transmission in the United States—that it was infecting Americans who had neither traveled abroad nor were in contact with others who had. In South Korea, more than 66,650 people were tested within a week of its first case of community transmission, and it quickly became able to test 10,000 people a day. The United Kingdom, which has only 115 positive cases, has so far tested 18,083 people for the virus.

Making matters worse, some people who have sought tests in the past few weeks have been turned away. And these shortcomings make it harder for the public health community to react to a virus that spreads quickly and easily.

Many people don’t really show symptoms of Covid-19, or their symptoms are very mild, but you want them to be tested anyway if there is an opportunity. To do that, doctors need to be able to order the test, which the CDC is only now permitting them to do. Commercial labs only recently started processing the coronavirus test, too, a step health care providers had been urging the administration to take.

“The issue is with asymptomatic transmission. You don’t know who is infected, and symptoms aren’t going to help if the patient doesn’t have any,” Abraar Karan, a Harvard physician, said. “A rapid test would help because you can then do mass testing at scale.”

Another is the criteria for who qualified to be tested. Originally, that was limited only to people who traveled to China or who had been in close contact with someone known to have Covid-19.

Then the tests expanded to include anyone who traveled to any affected country, as well as people with unexplained flu-like symptoms. Now, anyone with a physician’s authorization can be tested for Covid-19 — that is, if they can access a test.

Meanwhile, the federal government has decreased some regulatory roadblocks for more testing labs to come online. Labs can now start testing if they are pursuing an emergency authorization to test, and don’t have to wait for the Food and Drug Administration to give them final approval.

What needs to happen

As cases of Covid-19 in China were increasing dramatically in January and February, a lot of the US response was focused on travel restrictions and travel-focused testing. In retrospect, there should have been more planning for a pandemic.

“Once it was established this virus was spreading efficiently between people by the respiratory route, [we] immediately should’ve realized that this was not going to be containable,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, writes in an email. “At that point every country in the world should [have begun] pandemic preparation. This would include scaling up diagnostic testing, preparing hospitals, and crafting public health messages.”

Instead, the response may have even made the US more vulnerable. “The focus on keeping the virus out of the US, rather than turning to preparedness and mitigation of US outbreaks, may have delayed really critical efforts to keep vulnerable populations safe, like nursing home residents,” said Crystal Watson, senior scholar for the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins.

We don’t need testing just to diagnose sick people coming into doctor’s offices and hospitals. We also need testing to do surveillance out in communities. “You actually have to go out like now in many places in the US and start taking samples from people,” Grubaugh says.

Those surveillance studies will help us understand how prevalent milder cases are in populations. And the addition of those milder cases into data sets will help researchers determine, more accurately, how deadly this virus is, whom it tends to infect, and how often people spread it before showing symptoms. As testing ramps up, be prepared to hear about a lot more cases of Covid-19 in the US.

All that information can then be used to better halt the spread of the illness.

Again, without testing, we’re in the dark. And while we’re in the dark, the virus can spread. “We don’t know what the prevalence actually is,” Rasmussen says. “So in the short term, I think that we’re going to start seeing community spread in a number of places other than Seattle.”

https://www.vox.com/,"A long foreseen shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) — including masks, N95 respirators, and gowns — is crippling health workers’ ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. And as doctors and nurses are forced to reuse gear in ways that put themselves and patients at risk of infection, they’re begging the Trump administration to use readily available legal tools to solve the crisis.

In a joint March 21 letter to President Trump, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the American Nurses Association called on the administration to “immediately use the Defense Production Act to increase the domestic production of medical supplies and equipment that hospitals, health, health systems, physicians, nurses and all front line providers so desperately need.”

The Defense Production Act of 1950, originally signed during the Korean War, gives the president the authority to demand that businesses manufacture much-needed wartime supplies. In this case, the supplies aren’t titanium artillery; they’re equipment to protect frontline health workers from a highly contagious virus. In using the DPA, the president would order “the diversion of certain materials and facilities from ordinary use to national defense purposes, when national defense needs cannot otherwise be satisfied in a timely fashion.” In other words, he would direct factories that typically make other goods to start making medical resources ASAP.

Although Trump tweeted March 18 that he had signed the DPA, he said he would only be using it in a “worst case scenario in the future.”

I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2020

And, when asked in a March 21 press briefing why he had not yet compelled companies to manufacture and sell supplies in accordance with the DPA, he said, “We have the Act to use in case we need it, but we have so many things being made right now by so many … they are volunteering.”

Yet the joint AHA-AMA-ANA letter makes it clear that current voluntary efforts are insufficient, and that the “worst case scenario” is already here.

“Even with the infusion of supplies from the strategic stockpile and other federal resources, there will not be enough medical supplies, including ventilators, to respond to the projected COVID-19 outbreak,” the letter reads. “We have heard of health care providers reusing masks or resorting to makeshift alternatives for masks.”

Interviews with doctors and nurses on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, many of whom requested anonymity because they did not have permission from their hospitals to speak with the media, show that there is no time for the confusion surrounding whether Trump actually plans to use the DPA.

The shortage is requiring health care officials to stretch their current supplies in creative — and dangerous — ways

Doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators have been warning that they might run out of PPE for weeks now, but the warnings have become more urgent in recent days. For many hospitals, running out of masks is no longer something that “might happen.” The shortage is here.

Among the resources running dangerously low are N95 respirators, the masks that cup the face closely and have been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to block the inhalation of 95 percent of small airborne particles.

According to NIOSH guidance for extending N95 supply, hospitals should advise their staff to, “discard N95 respirators following close contact with, or exit from, the care area of any patient co-infected with an infectious disease requiring contact precautions.” But as the shortage worsens, reusing these masks is becoming the go-to method of preservation.

“Initially, we had single-use N95 masks,” says one nurse who has been treating Covid-19 patients at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts. “Now we reuse our N95s five times before discarding.” The eye shields she uses are also meant for single use, but nurses are being asked to wear the same eye shield for 12 hours. “We’re bringing them between different patient rooms, which isn’t exactly ideal,” she says.

In cases where providers must reuse PPE such as N95s, the CDC recommends measures such as hand-washing before adjusting the masks and storing them in clean paper bags when not in use.

The shortage of hospital masks, gowns, and eye shields poses a health risk to both providers and the patients they’re treating. Reusing masks or wearing the same eye shield when treating multiple patients further contributes to the spread of Covid-19 at a time when the country desperately needs to be slowing down the rate of new infections, or “flattening the curve.”

While it’s unclear exactly how many health providers in the US have been infected with Covid-19 so far specifically due to the reuse of PPE or for other reasons, Italy’s experience is telling. Equipment shortages have also been dire there, and over 4,000 health care workers have been infected and over a dozen have died. Over 3,000 health workers in China were infected as well, with several deaths.

In Italy, 4,824 medics contracted #coronavirus, at least 18 doc died



In China, >3,400 medics were infected, at least 13 doc died



In Spain, 3,475 medics been infected, at least 1 nurse died



Yet in US, we're still not doing everything we can to protect our frontliners?!#COVID19 https://t.co/uHztLtnFq8 — Andy Biotech (@AndyBiotech) March 23, 2020

In the US, the shortage is affecting small clinics and large, well-funded hospitals alike.

The nurse from Cape Cod Hospital, who shared that she and her colleagues had been reusing N95s, said, “We are one of the more fortunate hospitals right now. We have definitely not peaked in this area yet, [but] it’s only a matter of time before we run out of masks. We definitely need more.”

Ani Bilazarian, 25, an ER nurse at a New York City trauma center, says the protocol at her hospital is “truly changing every hour of every day in terms of what we’re wearing.” She says the original protective protocol for nurses at her hospital included wearing an N95 mask layered beneath another mask, layered beneath a disposable face shield, which was to be discarded after treating each patient. “Now it’s definitely getting more drastic, even just within the week,” she says. “We got an email yesterday saying we have one mask to keep for our entire shift, and that we should bring it home with us … that’s our one mask. For I’m not sure how long.”

To avoid having to reuse N95 masks, many hospitals are allocating them only to staff members who are directly entering patient rooms — which, in turn, means limiting the number of staff members who enter patient rooms in the first place.

“Before, if I forgot a medication or had to leave a patient’s room, I would have to take off [all of my PPE] and put it all back on,” says Bilazarian. “But we’re trying to combat that with innovative solutions. We now have people outside the rooms — we’re calling them runners — who can go get you stuff. So we’re definitely trying to limit the number of people requiring PPE and who need to be exposed at all.”

A spokesperson from the Boston Medical Center said his hospital is taking similar measures. “We’re limiting the number of staff that go into patient rooms and the number of times we enter and exit to preserve supply [of PPE],” he said. “We’re looking closely at alternate sources of supplies like construction shields, and thinking creatively to clean, disinfect, and reuse equipment to preserve supply.”

Other hospitals are limiting the use of N95s at all, turning instead to less protective options.

Related Why lifesaving ventilators will be in short supply for the foreseeable future

”The management is telling the nurses to wear masks that are not N95, even though most of us would feel more comfortable and safer with the N95,” says another nurse, who works at Baptist Health in Miami. “We are trying to fight for what’s right but when the CDC says you can wear a bandana or scarf in the place of a mask, it’s hard,” referring to the CDC’s guidance for optimizing the supply of facemasks. It notes, “In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.”

Some states are requiring dentists and veterinary clinics to donate surplus PPE to hospitals

While health care workers are working to stretch their own supplies, some local officials are rallying other industries that use PPE to funnel it to local hospitals and clinics.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed an executive order requiring all hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, outpatient clinics, dental clinics, and veterinary clinics with surplus PPE supplies to notify the state’s PPE coordinator to arrange for a handoff. Vets, dentists, and the like are ordered, by law, to participate in the reallocation of this excess equipment to the nurses and doctors directly treating patients. According to the executive order, any person found to be in violation would be subject to the penalties of a Class C misdemeanor.

As for industries that use PPE in other capacities, like construction and farming, the Oregon executive order “strongly encourages” — though does not mandate — that these individuals and entities “cancel or postpone non-essential uses of PPE during the ongoing state of emergency, so that the equipment can be conserved and redirected to the state’s Covid-19 response.”

For the federal government’s part, Vice President Mike Pence has said that “industrial masks that they use on construction sites are perfectly acceptable for health care workers to be protected from a respiratory disease,” and is urging construction companies to donate their supply of N95s. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which President Trump signed into law March 19, includes protections for industries manufacturing personal respiratory protective devices — meaning that the government will protect these companies from lawsuits if they sell the masks to health workers.

But as the AHA-AMA-ANA letter to Trump noted, protecting these companies from lawsuits is not enough — the government, they say, must use the DPA to directly order them to manufacture these supplies.

“We need companies to be creative”

As the PPE shortage continues to affect more of our nation’s hospitals — and the DPA-ordered manufacturing remains in limbo — public officials like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are also calling on individuals and companies to generate unconventional solutions.

In its guidance, the CDC says that “homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown,” and suggests that “homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.”

The homemade option is nonetheless listed as a last resort — and one that many hospitals are exploring.

Take for example, Dr. Mark Lewis, a hematologist and oncologist at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, who shared a step-by-step sewing tutorial on Twitter:

Bilazarian, the New York trauma nurse, says she is grateful for the creative DIY solutions people are coming up with, but has doubts about whether they will be effective enough to protect providers like herself and the patients they’re caring for.

“We have about 15 nurses out now from the ER, and more professionals are getting sick,” she says. “For now, we are managing with the resources that we have, but we are increasingly concerned for staffing and physical resources — not just PPE, but also ventilators, fluids, and pain medication as the virus intensifies, especially here in New York. We have to ask, ‘Is our frontline staff prepared to fill in the gaps in care when we need them?’ I hope so, but I’m not quite sure at this moment in time.”

To safely and adequately protect providers and patients as the pandemic inevitably spreads further, large-scale PPE manufacturing efforts are needed to resupply hospitals with the safest gear. But doing so — and then distributing the gear— could take days and weeks that nurses and doctors don’t have to spare.

“We are desperate,” said another nurse who works at a New York hospital, who said she had spent her one day off running around collecting donations for PPE. “Please urge anybody who can donate any masks, but most importantly N95s, to do so.”

https://www.vox.com/,"The United States has the most confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world, with nearly eight times the number of cases reported in China and more than three times as many cases as Italy and Spain, other epicenters of this global outbreak. Confirmed infections in the US make up nearly a third of the world’s coronavirus cases.

America started off testing people for the coronavirus at a slower rate than most other developed countries, but the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US has risen more quickly than the country’s peers abroad. We don’t yet know the full extent of the outbreak, but America remains a focal point of the coronavirus pandemic.

The US health system was less prepared for a pandemic than those of other wealthy nations. A high uninsured rate, high out-of-pocket health care costs, and low medical system capacity combined to make the country more vulnerable to a pathogen before the coronavirus ever came to our shores. America’s lax response in the early days of the outbreak only compounded those structural problems.

“Everyone working in this space would agree that no matter how you measure it, the US is far behind on this,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox in mid-March of the initial coronavirus response.

Here’s how the number of confirmed cases in the US compares to select other countries, based on days since each country reached 100 confirmed cases, according to data we analyzed from the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard.

Note that the chart uses a log scale, meaning that the Y-axis goes up in equal distances between 100, 1,000, and 10,000 to mimic the exponential rate at which a contagion like the coronavirus spreads.

Here’s that same chart on a traditional linear scale.

As of April 16, the Johns Hopkins research data shows more than 2 million confirmed cases worldwide, about 640,000 of which were in the US. The actual number of cases is likely much higher. About 140,000 people have died across the world from Covid-19, including nearly 30,000 in the United States. There are signs that social distancing measures in the US are making an impact, but the country surpassed Iran, Italy, and China to have the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.

As the Wall Street Journal has reported, Chinese health officials recently acknowledged they did not include 1,500 asymptomatic cases in their previous national tallies, but said that such cases would be counted starting on April 1. Based on reporting by the South China Morning Post, China may be undercounting asymptomatic cases to an even greater degree. But remember, most countries’ numbers are probably low because people who have no or mild symptoms generally don’t get tested.

Case numbers in the US have also far outpaced places like South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, where the governments mobilized more quickly and certain cultural norms (like mask-wearing) may have helped slow the spread. (Early signs of a second wave of cases have recently appeared in Singapore, however; this was a fear among public health experts who worried societies would be too quick to reopen.)

Japan’s case numbers also appear to be low, though they have risen in recent weeks, and the government has been criticized over not having enough tests to properly judge the number of cases. On the other hand, the number of deaths in Japan is small compared to the hardest-hit countries, suggesting better containment than in some European nations or the US.

As America implements dramatic measures to control the spread of Covid-19, with schools and businesses closing and general social distancing underway, the country is still struggling to understand the full scope of the outbreak because of the slow start of testing. It has undeniably hindered the US response.

“The testing failure is putting additional strain on our already challenged health system,” Cynthia Cox, director of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, said. “The combination of all of these factors will make the US worse off than similar countries.”

Testing is not only important because it gets people diagnosed and appropriate treatment if they do have an infection; it also establishes how widespread a virus actually is. Experts know the size of the problem, they know the rate at which people are being hospitalized or dying, and they can follow its movements.

But the United States has faltered in rolling out coronavirus tests, putting America far behind its economic peers in tracing the outbreak. A manufacturing problem with the test kits that were initially sent out in the field, and a delay in approving commercial tests, set the nation back in stopping or slowing down Covid-19.

Even as testing capacity has ramped up in the US, as of April 16, America is still lagging behind other places in the world hit hardest by the virus in the share of its population being tested. The US has tested about half as many people per million residents as Italy, a focal point of Europe’s outbreak, and Germany, considered a model of rapid and widespread testing.

There have been more than 3.2 million tests conducted in the US for its population of 329 million, but the number of tests per capita conducted varies greatly by state.

The US has finally started to catch up to the rest of the developed world in responding to Covid-19. But as case numbers and deaths continue to increase, we’re still learning the full scope of the crisis.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump revealed a grim projection in the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday: Even with the social distancing the US is doing now, 100,000 to 200,000 Americans will likely die as a result of the ongoing outbreak. “When you see 100,000 people, that’s a minimum number,” Trump said.

It’s a horrifying figure. That’s more people than ever died in a single year from HIV/AIDS, drug overdoses, gun violence, or car crashes in the US. It’s more than American casualties during the entire Vietnam War.

But it’s also a horrifying number, in part, because much of it was likely preventable. If the US — including the Trump administration — had better prepared for pandemics, the country likely could have avoided ever talking about 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.

The estimated death toll “was not inevitable,” Céline Gounder, an epidemiologist at New York University, told me. “If we’d jumped into contract tracing and testing, social distancing, and health system preparedness as soon as we heard reports from China, we’d be in a very different situation now.”

Under Trump, the US had years to prepare. With warnings from President Barack Obama’s administration and activists like Bill Gates, it was always clear that America was vulnerable to a pandemic. (Vox did a whole episode about it for Netflix.) For many, the 2014-’16 Ebola outbreak exposed the threat; Jeremy Konyndyk, who worked in the Obama administration during the Ebola outbreak, told me he “came away from that experience just completely horrified at how unready we would be for something more dangerous than Ebola,” which, thankfully, was relatively hard to transmit.

In the years leading to the coronavirus outbreak, though, Trump did not take the concerns seriously. His administration shut down the White House office, set up after the Ebola outbreak, that oversaw disease outbreaks and pandemics. It repeatedly proposed cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies (although Congress largely rejected those cuts). The administration cut a public health position that was meant to help detect disease outbreaks in China, where the coronavirus outbreak began.

By the time it became clear that the world was facing a serious threat in January and February, Trump and his administration were again slow to act. Despite declaring a public health emergency, the administration failed to establish the infrastructure for nationwide testing — holding up private testing labs with bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles while sending out its own faulty test kits. The administration did nothing of substance to really scale up the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, allowing a shortage to take root. Trump still hasn’t leveraged the full might of the Defense Production Act to get medical supplies to hospitals and clinics that need them to fight the outbreak.

The failure on testing alone is massive — one that remains today. As Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo told the New York Times, “Had we had done more testing from the very beginning and caught cases earlier, we would be in a far different place.”

The result is an outbreak that looks very different in the US than in the few countries, like South Korea and Taiwan, that have better contained Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

This isn’t solely on Trump. Some of it comes down to chance — that the coronavirus is popping up now and is so deadly and contagious is obviously not under any president’s control. Konyndyk’s experience under Obama shows the previous administration wasn’t ready for a pandemic either. Experts and advocates argue that pandemic preparedness, along with public health more broadly, is notoriously underfunded not just in the US but around the world. Some local and state officials, such as in New York City and Florida, have also underreacted to the crisis, making it worse.

But Trump, perhaps more than any other president, had plenty of warning about what was to come. He squandered all the opportunities given to him to do better, leaving much of the aggressive action that has reduced the death toll — down from the millions the White House and experts say is possible without interventions — to local and state officials who simply don’t have the reach of the federal government.

So now 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are likely to die.

Trump failed to prepare, then downplayed the coronavirus outbreak

Every step of the way, the Trump administration failed to take the threat of a pandemic seriously.

The threat was long well-known, including to the federal government. Government simulations and exercises before the outbreak revealed that there were a lot of problems, from the lack of sufficient PPE to simple confusion between the cities, states, and many federal agencies about who’s in charge during a crisis.

Trump reacted to the risks by deprioritizing pandemic preparedness. In 2018, then–National Security Adviser John Bolton fired Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who, the Washington Post reported, “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks.” Then Bolton let go the head of pandemic response, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, and his global health security team. The team, the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, was the main group within the White House for pandemic preparedness — and it was never replaced.

At the time, the Trump administration and Bolton said the cuts were needed to streamline the National Security Council. But what it did, experts have told me, is leave the US unready for a crisis of the magnitude it’s facing now.

“The basic systems need to be in place for global, state, and local responses,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, previously told me. “When you don’t shore those up, you’re not starting from scratch, but you’re catching up every single time.”

Even once it became clear that the coronavirus pandemic was a real threat, Trump downplayed the outbreak. He compared the novel coronavirus to the seasonal flu, when the coronavirus is in fact much deadlier and more contagious than the flu. He called concerns about the virus a “hoax.” He said on national television that, based on nothing more than a self-admitted “hunch,” the death rate of the disease was much lower than public health officials projected. Even after his administration invoked social distancing guidelines, Trump talked up the idea of doing away with them by Easter to allow for “packed churches.”

Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, described the administration’s early messaging as “deeply disturbing,” adding that it’s “left the country far less prepared than it needs to be for what is a very substantial challenge ahead.”

Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks. He ultimately extended his task force’s social distancing guidelines through April. On Tuesday, he went after the claim — that, again, he repeatedly made before — that coronavirus is like flu: “It’s not the flu. It’s vicious,” he said.

But however Trump may feel now, his administration’s failure to take this threat seriously early on left the country in a much worse place.

A recent investigation by the New York Times exposed how the Trump administration failed to scale up testing. The CDC developed its own test for coronavirus — seemingly to make a more accurate test than what was available from other places — but the test turned out to be faulty, and the CDC took weeks to provide a fix. Meanwhile, the administration put up all sorts of regulatory hurdles that prevented private labs from rolling out their own tests.

The result: The US was only testing about 100 samples a day by mid-February, according to the Times.

The Times concluded, “Across the government, [experts] said, three agencies responsible for detecting and combating threats like the coronavirus failed to prepare quickly enough. Even as scientists looked at China and sounded alarms, none of the agencies’ directors conveyed the urgency required to spur a no-holds-barred defense.”

This failure alone doomed the US to a much bigger outbreak, forcing Americans to rely far more on social distancing and suffer many more deaths. That’s because testing is crucial, especially in the early stages, to curtailing an outbreak: First, it lets public health officials identify sick people, isolate them, and trace their recent contacts to make sure those people aren’t sick and get them into quarantine as well. Second, testing lets officials detect which places are hardest hit and, therefore, require the most attention and help.

Yet, even today, testing remains a problem. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said this week that Trump’s claim that testing is no longer a problem is “just not true” and states are still “flying blind” due to insufficient testing.

Testing is only one example among many. The country is also experiencing a shortage of PPE for health care workers and ventilators for treatment. Both problems were repeatedly raised in pandemic simulations, but the federal government failed to replenish its Strategic National Stockpile and failed to scale up domestic production and supply chains. Even now, Trump has refused to use the full powers of the Defense Production Act, which would allow the federal government to demand more domestic production of these goods (although it’d likely take at least weeks for this production to scale up).

The lack of medical supplies is one reason experts worry the US won’t have the health care capacity to deal with a flood of Covid-19 patients, leading to sickness, suffering, and death due to insufficient treatment.

Again, a lot of this goes back to poor preparation in the years before the Covid-19 pandemic — and, indeed, the years before Trump was in office — but Trump and his administration failed to prepare even once the threat of the coronavirus became clear.

There’s another way this could have gone

These outcomes weren’t inevitable. Other countries that were more aggressive earlier seemed to reduce their potential death tolls.

Just take a look at this chart comparing Covid-19 cases between different countries and places:

The US’s trajectory in this chart is exponential: The number of cases is clearly rising every single day. But while US cases seemed to explode about two weeks after the 100th case, a few places — like South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong — managed to flatten their curves with early, aggressive action around the same time.

South Korea did this, as Max Fisher and Choe Sang-Hun reported at the New York Times, with a lot of testing. While the US was still doing at most 100 tests a day, South Korea was pumping them out in the thousands, if not tens of thousands, a day. This allowed officials in South Korea to detect where outbreaks were happening and contain them — particularly by getting people to isolate and quarantine, along with some restrictions on movement, travel, and socializing — before things got too out of control.

The US is obviously not South Korea. It’s much bigger, more sprawling, and more populous. But the South Korean experience shows that aggressive testing, as one example, could help contain coronavirus. The US, due largely to the Trump administration’s failures, just didn’t have the capabilities South Korea did here.

There’s plenty of other evidence that early, aggressive action can help contain epidemics. During the 1918 flu pandemic, some US cities took quick, decisive action while others didn’t. A 2007 study in PNAS exposed the different outcomes in St. Louis, which quickly imposed restrictions to force social distancing, and Philadelphia, which didn’t, in this telling chart:

The study concluded that “cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (≈20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.”

If Trump had acted sooner, the US could have had a better chance at replicating the results from St. Louis in 1918 or South Korea in 2020. But that moment has passed — and Americans are now facing the deaths of potentially hundreds of thousands of their friends, family, and peers as a result.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"In one of the key moments of his March 20 press conference about the Covid-19 pandemic, President Trump touted hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, as a potential treatment for the illness, even while the top health official beside him urged caution about it.

“This is prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem and it’s very effective,” Trump said. “It was a strong drug.” He later added, “I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, and a beacon of evidence-based policy in the administration’s botched pandemic response, had been asked by a reporter whether hydroxychloroquine could be used against Covid-19 after reports surfaced this week of doctors using it in other countries to treat patients. Fauci was clear: The evidence was thin and anecdotal. (Their extended exchange was bizarre and revealing, as my colleague German Lopez reported.)

But what is the deal with hydroxychloroquine, you ask? With the spread of the coronavirus across the world and increasing numbers of infected people, there’s now an international race to develop effective treatments for Covid-19. And hydroxychloroquine, a less-toxic derivative of chloroquine, another malaria drug, has emerged as one of the frontrunners. (Chloroquine itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.)

Hydroxychloroquine, the less toxic version, is an appealing option mainly because it’s an off-the-shelf drug. Companies know how to make it, there are low-cost generic versions available, and the drug has already been tested and approved for use against malaria and to treat inflammation in conditions like arthritis.

But as Fauci noted, it has not been approved as a treatment for Covid-19, and right now, the evidence for its effectiveness is sparse.

Chinese researchers showed in lab cell culture tests that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from the virus behind Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, blocking it from entering cells. Some doctors in China and South Korea have also used it to treat patients. And a recent study by researchers in France found that the drug was “efficient” in clearing upper airways from the virus in three to six days in most patients. That timing is important because an untreated infected person can transmit the virus for 20 days or more, even without showing symptoms. So it’s important to shrink the amount of time a person carries the virus in order to limit its spread.

“Such results are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to decisionmakers to fight this emerging viral infection in real-time even if other strategies and research including vaccine development could be also effective, but only in the future,” the French researchers wrote. “We therefore recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world.”

But the researchers only looked at 36 patients and only 26 actually received hydroxychloroquine in the study — a tiny sample size. Hydroxychloroquine can also have side effects like headaches, dizziness, and diarrhea, so it’s not something that doctors can blanketly prescribe. And the study wasn’t blinded, meaning the patients knew what they were getting, nor was it randomized. That limits the scientific merit of the study.

That said, there are plans for wider testing. At least six clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine are recruiting patients or in planning stages around the world. In the meantime, health officials are scrambling to get enough Covid-19 tests and to build up the capacity to care for a looming surge in patients.

Right now, the most effective way to fight the virus remains not getting infected in the first place, which means using good personal hygiene like hand-washing, and social distancing measures.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"The Supreme Court quietly denied a motion on Tuesday that sought to hustle along a case asking the courts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.

The denial keeps the case alive while almost certainly delaying any reckoning on it until after the 2020 election. Though the Court may still hear the case, it’s unlikely to decide the case until 2021 at the earliest.

In practical terms, that’s a double victory for Republicans: It leaves open the possibility that Obamacare will be killed by a judicial decree, but spares Republican candidates from the media spotlight that would come from a high-profile Supreme Court fight involving a challenge to the Affordable Care Act.

The lawsuit, which was simultaneously styled as California v. Texas and House of Representatives v. Texas in the Supreme Court, is widely viewed as absurd even by many conservative legal advocates who backed previous efforts to undercut Obamacare through federal litigation. In essence, the Texas plaintiffs argue that the entire Affordable Care Act should be repealed because a provision of the law — that literally does nothing — is unconstitutional.

Nevertheless, a coalition of red states won largely favorable legal rulings because the Texas litigation has, so far, been heard almost exclusively by very conservative judges. Judge Reed O’Connor, a former Republican Senate staffer, declared that the entire law must be struck down in 2018. About a year later, two Republican members of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed most of O’Connor’s order.

The Fifth Circuit also effectively placed the lawsuit in suspended animation for the medium-term future. While the appeals court agreed with O’Connor that a single provision of Obamacare is now unconstitutional, it sent the case back down to O’Connor with instructions that he must identify which other provisions of the law must also fall.

The Texas litigation is widely seen as absurd

The plaintiffs’ legal arguments in Texas are flimsy, and have been widely mocked by lawyers and scholars across the political spectrum. Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor and one of the leading evangelists for an earlier lawsuit seeking to undermine the Affordable Care Act, labeled many of the Texas plaintiffs’ arguments “implausible,” “hard to justify,” and “surprisingly weak.”

The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial board labeled this lawsuit the “Texas ObamaCare Blunder.”

Texas rests on the proposition that the tax legislation Trump signed in 2017 secretly requires the courts to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act.

As originally enacted, Obamacare requires most Americans to pay higher income taxes if they do not have health insurance. This is the “individual mandate,” which the Supreme Court upheld as a valid exercise of Congress’s power to levy taxes.

The 2017 tax legislation effectively repealed the individual mandate by zeroing out the amount of taxes that Americans who do not have health insurance are required to pay. This repeal of the mandate, according to the Texas plaintiffs, renders the zeroed-out mandate unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court upheld the fully functional mandate as a tax, they argue, the zeroed-out mandate must be unconstitutional because a zero dollar tax is no tax at all.

This legal attack on the non-mandate mandate is plausible — though not airtight — but the final stage of the plaintiffs’ argument is bizarre. In essence, the Texas plaintiffs argue that if the zeroed-out mandate is unconstitutional, then the proper remedy is to strike down the whole Affordable Care Act in its entirety. This remedy is at odds with a raft of Supreme Court precedents, including a 2018 decision authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito.

Obamacare’s defenders wanted the Supreme Court to hear this case quickly

It is very unlikely that five members of the current Supreme Court will agree with the Texas plaintiffs. So a coalition of blue states and the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives both asked the Supreme Court to hear Texas as quickly as possible. That request to expedite the case was denied on Tuesday — although the Supreme Court could still take up the case at a later date.

Obamacare’s opponents, which include the coalition of red states and the Trump administration, both urged the Court not to expedite the case because the Fifth Circuit’s decision did not (yet) disturb any operational part of the law. It appears that a majority of the justices were convinced by this argument.

As a practical matter, this delay allows the litigation to quietly move forward in O’Connor’s courtroom, where it may lie dormant until after the election. That could spare President Trump — as well as Republicans like Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted against repealing much of Obamacare but who also voted to confirm both of Trump’s Supreme Court appointees — from having to explain to voters why Republicans are trying to take millions of people’s health care away.

The delay could also potentially change the outcome of the case. While Chief Justice John Roberts, the median vote on the current Supreme Court, is very unlikely to buy the plaintiffs’ arguments in Texas, he may be the only Republican member of the current Court who would not vote to repeal Obamacare. If the Texas litigation lingers until Trump can replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 86 years old, or Justice Stephen Breyer, who is 81, then the plaintiffs in Texas could succeed in destroying Obamacare.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"The Trump administration is paving the road for states to design new eligibility requirements for Medicaid, including forcing many recipients to work, look for work, or volunteer in order to qualify for government health coverage.

It’s a dramatic shift for the 50-year-old program. Under current law, eligibility for Medicaid is based almost entirely on income. But the Trump administration, after months of promises, is now telling states how they can introduce a new requirement that certain Medicaid recipients also work in order to receive health coverage through the program — a move that experts say is a significant departure from the program’s purpose of providing a safety net to Americans in or near poverty.

“Conditioning Medicaid eligibility and coverage on work is a fundamental change to the 50-plus-year history of the Medicaid program,” MaryBeth Musumeci, who studies Medicaid at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

Right now, 10 states have proposals pending with the Trump administration to impose some kind of work or community engagement requirement, almost all of them led by Republican legislatures and governors. The first proposed waiver with a Medicaid work requirement, from Kentucky, was quickly approved by the administration on Friday.

The new guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services offers some parameters for these requirements. Certain populations — the elderly and pregnant women, for example — are expected to be exempt. States are expected to consider various activities, including volunteering and caregiving, to comply with these work requirements. They are also asked to account for high unemployment in some areas and to accommodate, in the midst of the opioid crisis, people in drug treatment.

But in spite of the administration’s nods to these various vulnerable populations, critics said the guidance released Thursday did not actually provide sturdy guardrails to protect them.

“It’s like the Wild West. Who knows what will come in the door?” Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University professor who has followed Medicaid policy for decades, said. “Everything is couched as ‘you could,’ ‘you might,’ ‘you should think about.’ It’s like winking and nodding throughout the whole thing. They are not saying, ‘These are the limits on what we’ll approve.’”

Republicans argue that requiring work for Medicaid eligibility will lead to better health outcomes, because employment can be linked to improved health and help move people off Medicaid as they make more money. But many Medicaid recipients are already working. If they are not, then they are likely elderly, disabled, retired, sick, or caring for a loved one. These new bureaucratic hurdles could impede some Americans’ ability to access health insurance and the care they need.

The Trump administration’s Medicaid work requirements, explained

Republicans have long criticized the Affordable Care Act for expanding Medicaid eligibility to non-disabled adults without children, a move that has covered more than 15 million Americans in or near poverty. Though Congress failed to repeal the expansion, CMS Administrator Seema Verma has pledged to use her administrative authority to rein the program back in.

Requiring work for non-disabled adults, particularly the expansion population, is central to the Trump administration’s vision of reshaping the Medicaid program as long as Congress is unable to act.

“This policy is about helping people achieve the American dream,” Verma told reporters on Thursday. “People moving off of Medicaid is a good outcome because we hope that means they don’t need the program anymore.”

States and the federal government jointly fund Medicaid, but states are responsible for running it. Work requirements cannot be imposed at a national level without congressional action, but states can propose a work requirement in a waiver, and the Trump administration can approve it.

Most fundamentally, CMS urged states to target any work requirements for non-disabled working adults; pregnant women, the disabled, and the medically frail are expected to be exempt. However, experts questioned how ironclad that guardrail is, given that parts of the guidance released Thursday appear to only suggest, not mandate, that those populations should be excluded from any work requirements.

“There is a breathtaking lack of guardrails. Basically almost anything goes,” Rosenbaum said. “There’s really nobody who’s exempt.”

The Trump administration says that states should try to align any Medicaid work requirements with existing mandates for federal food stamps and cash welfare programs, which generally require 20 to 30 hours of work or related activity every week. Those programs also exempt pregnant women and the disabled.

States are advised to consider a range of activities to fulfill the work requirements, including actual employment, job training, volunteering, or caregiving. CMS officials said states would have broad authority to decide what will actually be considered in compliance with their work requirements.

The agency singled out the need to continue providing Medicaid coverage for people with opioid addictions, in the midst of a crisis killing 60,000 Americans every year, and urged states to consider drug treatment to be counted toward a work requirement.

However, several experts noted that CMS will not be providing federal resources for states to administer their work requirements. The administration may be constrained by federal law, which requires Medicaid dollars to pay for actual health care, but the result nevertheless is that states could struggle to effectively implement their work requirements and any bureaucratic snafus could result in people who need and should qualify for Medicaid coverage losing it.

“For a state to do this, it would take enormous resources, and they’re not going to put those in,” Judy Solomon, who follows Medicaid at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told me. “We know enough to know this can’t be implemented in a way that protects people. At the end of the day, it’s going to have people who need health care lose coverage.”

Rosenbaum also warned about “the potential for enormous discrimination, really racial redlining.” She noted that CMS would allow states to account for local conditions, such as high unemployment in certain areas or other factors, to provide exemptions from a work requirement.

Rural areas, more likely to be white, could have fewer job opportunities, less robust transportation, and fewer social support services, all things that might lead a state to provide an exemption from the work requirement. The result, intentional or not, is that black people on Medicaid — because they are more likely to live in urban areas, where those grounds for exemption are less likely to be found — could face a higher burden under these waivers.

“All of these things are potentially much harder to come by in rural areas,” Rosenbaum said. “Because of the demographics, you could have situations where the populations required to work are disproportionately African-American.”

Most Medicaid recipients already work or have good reason not to

There is strong evidence that there is not a vast number of Medicaid enrollees who are avoiding work to stay on the program’s rolls.

Research conducted by the University of Michigan and published last month in JAMA looks at the work status of people who enrolled in Medicaid after Michigan expanded the program under Obamacare. It stands out from other research because it’s based on interviews with enrollees, rather than on administrative data or other information.

The big-picture takeaway is: Most Medicaid enrollees in Michigan were working already, unable to work, or at a point in their lives where they would not work (retired or a student). Almost three-fourths of the people in the study fell into those categories.

Nearly half of the Michigan Medicaid enrollees were working. Another quarter were either unable to work or were retired, in school, or acting as a homemaker. State proposals to institute such a mandate usually make allowances for the Medicaid enrollees who are in school or have a disability that stops them from working.

Only 27.6 percent were “out of work” — not working but would work. Those are the people who might be affected by a work requirement.

Even within the “out of work” population, based on the Michigan survey, are people with real barriers to working — and who might benefit from having health insurance:

Two-thirds said they had a chronic physical illness.

35 percent said they had been diagnosed with a mental illness.

One-quarter said they had a physical or mental condition that interfered with their ability to function at least half of the time.

“The question raised by these data for states is — is it worth the cost to screen and track enrollees when only a small minority isn’t working who are potentially able to work,” Dr. Renuka Tipirneni, lead author of the Michigan study, said in a statement.

The findings in Michigan align with broader national surveys. The Kaiser Family Foundation found in 2015 that most Medicaid enrollees who might be expected to work were ill or disabled, retired, going to school, or taking care of their family.

Not only do most Medicaid recipients who might be affected already work, but the new requirements could place an administrative burden on those people that could cause them to lose coverage, even if they are actually in compliance with the requirements.

“Documenting compliance will often not be trivial, and even small hassle costs can discourage people from signing up for insurance coverage,” Matt Fiedler, who covers health care policy for the Brookings Institution, told me. “Higher hassle costs will likely cause meaningful reductions in Medicaid coverage even among people who are working.”

Medicaid work requirements could soon be approved — and challenged

CMS said that 10 states had submitted waivers requiring work or community engagement as a condition for Medicaid recipients. Some states, like Wisconsin and Kentucky, have proposed more robust changes, including drug-testing enrollees and requiring them to pay more out of pocket for their health care.

The Washington Post reported, citing sources familiar with the process, that the first work requirement could be approved as soon as Friday, probably for Kentucky. Others could soon follow.

But any approved waivers are expected to be swiftly met with legal challenges. The issue hinges on whether requiring work for Medicaid can be construed as furthering the goals of the Medicaid program, which contains no explicit reference to encouraging work. As the Post explained:

“This is going to go to court the minute the first approval comes out,” predicted Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, whose members reflect a spectrum of views about requiring work. The association Once CMS gives one state permission, “we would be looking very, very closely to the legal options,” said Leonardo Cuello, health policy director at the National Health Law Program. “It’s not a good idea, and it’s illegal.” Cuello said the argument that work promotes health is “totally contorted. . . . It’s a little like saying that rain causes clouds. It’s more that people [with Medicaid] get care, which helps them be healthy and makes them able to work.”

In the call with reporters on Thursday, Verma defended work requirements as in compliance with the goals of the Medicaid program, asserting that CMS considered the proposals to be well within the administration’s discretion to approve.

“As we know, there’s countless studies out there that show the link between having a job and positive health outcomes,” she said.

Any legal challenge will focus on the particulars of a state’s proposal and the administration’s explanation for approving the waiver, Nicholas Bagley, a health law professor at the University of Michigan, told me.

“The real devil will be in the details; it will be in the details of the plans that are submitted and in particular in the details of what CMS says in approving the waivers,” he said. “It’s a pretty flexible standard, and the courts are in general disinclined to second-guess an agency’s determination that a particular waiver will advance the program’s objectives or it’s a genuine test.”

So the matter is not yet resolved. But the Trump administration has opened a major new front in the battle over Medicaid.",2

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"President Donald Trump’s failure to respond to the coronavirus pandemic didn’t begin with the administration’s inability to send out the millions of test kits and the protective medical gear for health care workers that experts say are needed to tackle the crisis. It didn’t start with Trump’s bungled messaging downplaying the crisis even as it’s worsened, nor with his mid-March insistence that social distancing measures could be lifted by Easter (he later backpedaled).

It began in April 2018 — more than a year and a half before the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, sickened enough people in China that authorities realized they were dealing with a new disease.

The Trump administration, with John Bolton newly at the helm of the White House National Security Council, began dismantling the team in charge of pandemic response, firing its leadership and disbanding the team in spring 2018.

The cuts, coupled with the administration’s repeated calls to cut the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies, made it clear that the Trump administration wasn’t prioritizing the federal government’s ability to respond to disease outbreaks.

That lack of attention to preparedness, experts say, helps explain why the Trump administration has consistently botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The administration has in recent weeks taken steps to combat criticisms about its slow and muddled response to the coronavirus. Trump has been appearing on TV a lot more, starting with an Oval Office address and recently with daily press briefings. He declared a national emergency, advised Americans to social distance, vowed more testing for patients and medical equipment for health care workers, and promised more economic relief to those affected by the crisis.

But experts say a lot of the damage has been done: The federal government is still only playing catch-up, as thousands of new cases of coronavirus are confirmed and the death toll steadily increases every day.

The first sign of a massive failure came with testing. South Korea, which has been widely praised for its response to coronavirus, tested more than 66,000 people within a week of the first community transmission within its borders. By comparison, the US took roughly three weeks to complete that many tests — in a country that is much more populous and, now, is on track to have a much worse outbreak than South Korea and other nations.

Testing is crucial to slowing epidemics. First, it lets public health officials identify sick people and subsequently isolate them. Second, they can trace that sick person’s recent contacts to make sure those people aren’t sick and to get them into quarantine as well. It’s one of the best tools we have for an outbreak like this.

It’s also something that the federal government has done well before — recently, with H1N1 and Zika. “It’s been surprising to me that the administration’s had a hard time executing on some of these things,” Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, previously told me.

But it’s the kind of thing that the Trump administration has screwed up, while instead trying to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Trump himself has tweeted comparisons of Covid-19 to the common flu — which Jha describes as “really unhelpful,” because the novel coronavirus appears to be much worse. Trump also called concerns about the virus a “hoax.” He said on national television that, based on nothing more than a self-admitted “hunch,” the death rate of the disease is much lower than public health officials projected.

And Trump has rejected any accountability for the botched testing process: “I don’t take responsibility at all,” he said this month.

Jha described the Trump administration’s messaging so far as “deeply disturbing,” adding that it’s “left the country far less prepared than it needs to be for what is a very substantial challenge ahead.”

Even as the Trump administration has tried to escalate its efforts to combat the pandemic, Trump has continued to downplay concerns. Recently, he’s suggested that social distancing measures — asking people to stay home and keep their physical distance from one another — could be lifted within weeks, instead of the months experts say is likely necessary. “What a great timeline that would be,” Trump said.

This kind of downplaying has previously worked for Trump, who successfully, at least politically, fended off concerns about his handling of Hurricane Maria, the opioid epidemic, and a host of self-inflicted crises, from his travel ban to the crisis at the US-Mexico border.

But in the current pandemic, the approach has left the Trump administration unprepared for the challenge ahead, whether it’s in the failure in testing or the administration’s inability to calm the public and markets as the novel coronavirus spreads. And all of this can be traced back to the Trump administration’s decision in the spring of 2018 to deprioritize the federal government’s ability to respond to pandemics.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s failures began years ago

When Bolton became Trump’s national security adviser in 2018, he quickly moved to disband the White House National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which President Barack Obama set up after the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak to lead federal coordination and preparation for disease outbreaks.

In April 2018, Bolton fired Tom Bossert, then the homeland security adviser, who, the Washington Post reported, “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks.” Then, that May, Bolton let go the head of pandemic response, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, and his global health security team. The team, the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, was never replaced.

At the time, the Trump administration and Bolton argued the cuts were needed to streamline the National Security Council.

But, according to experts, the work of a global health security team, or something like it, is crucial to responding to any disease outbreak. Since the federal government is sprawling and large, it helps to have centralized leadership in case of a crisis. That leadership could ensure all federal agencies are doing the most they can and working toward a single set of goals.

But it’s important to have this kind of agency set up before an outbreak. Setting up an agency takes time; it requires hiring staff, handing out tasks and expected workloads, creating internal policies, and so on. A preexisting agency is also going to have plans worked out before an outbreak, with likely contingencies in place for what to do. That’s why it was so important to have this agency in place even during years, like 2018, when disease pandemics didn’t seem like a nearby threat to everyone.

“The basic systems need to be in place for global, state, and local responses,” Jen Kates, a senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “When you don’t shore those up, you’re not starting from scratch, but you’re catching up every single time.”

The Trump administration has since put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of handling the coronavirus pandemic, building out a team that includes well-respected experts like Deborah Birx. But this is in reaction to the epidemic, instead of something that a preexisting agency within the administration was working on for years.

Even some officials within the Trump administration have voiced concern about the team’s dismantling. “It would be nice if the office was still there,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said during a congressional hearing. “We worked very well with that office.”

The cuts are part of Trump’s broader policy agenda, focused largely on trimming the size of the federal government. He has repeatedly proposed cuts to agencies, like the CDC and NIH, on the front lines of the federal response to disease outbreaks. Trump’s most recent budget proposals asked for similar cuts — and the administration has stood by them. (But Congress has generally denied such proposals.)

In the months before the coronavirus outbreak, the administration cut a public health position that was meant to help detect disease outbreaks in China, where the pandemic began, Marisa Taylor reported for Reuters.

Even without such cuts, experts and advocates argue the US generally underfunds disease outbreak preparedness and public health programs more broadly. Further cuts just deepen the risks of pandemics.

By repeatedly undercutting outbreak preparedness, Jha said, the Trump administration signaled “to the government and all the agencies this is not a priority. And that means that even other agencies end up not putting as much attention and energy on it. So I think this has been a longstanding problem of the White House.”

Trump, for his part, has defended his record, arguing, “I’m a businessperson. I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”

But experts argue that’s not how pandemic preparedness should work. “You build a fire department ahead of time,” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Washington Post. “You don’t wait for a fire.”

The administration has been slow to react

Even after it became clear that the coronavirus outbreak was becoming a global threat in January, the Trump administration has been slow to prepare and react. The common refrain among experts is that other countries’ actions, such as China’s draconian measures, gave the US a bit of time to do something, but the federal government has failed to get even the basics right in that time.

That begins, first and foremost, with testing. But as report after report has confirmed, the US has done a bad job in this area — falling behind its developed peers in Europe and Asia. While the US has dramatically scaled up testing in recent weeks, health care workers and patients still complain that they still sometimes can’t obtain tests even when symptoms are present.

Not all of this is necessarily the Trump administration’s fault. When the CDC rolled out its tests, a component in them turned out to be faulty. That was unfortunate, but it put a big spotlight on the CDC’s decision to use its own test kit instead of test kits other countries have used, reportedly in an effort to create a more accurate test. Since then, as Olga Khazan explained at the Atlantic, the Trump administration consistently failed to make things better, with reports of infighting making it harder for the administration to get its act together.

But this is exactly the kind of situation that proper preparedness, well, prepares federal agencies for. If the Trump administration had prioritized outbreak prevention before the coronavirus pandemic, it might have used the time prior to Covid-19’s appearance — or even January and February, when the global threat was increasingly clear — to establish contingencies in case something went wrong.

“These kinds of things are what you prepare for, why you do preparedness planning, so this kind of thing doesn’t happen,” Kates said. “Right now everyone’s playing catch-up to try to address these gaps, and every day matters. A good preparedness plan would be addressing that from the outset.”

This is, after all, something the federal government has done before for outbreaks, from H1N1 to Zika. A big difference from then to now is that Trump is in charge.

Recognizing the criticisms, the Trump administration has promised to try to boost testing output, including a partnership with the private sector. But while things are improving, the full rollout of tests will likely take weeks — eating up crucial time that could have gone to actually using the tests to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

One of the problems is Trump has consistently downplayed the coronavirus, comparing it to the common flu and claiming that his administration is doing a “GREAT job” and keeping things under control. Even when announcing his administration’s goal to get 5 million test kits out, Trump said, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.”

Some of that may be political. Politico reporter Dan Diamond told NPR host Terry Gross that, based on his own reporting, Trump “did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that’s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear — the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.”

Some of it could also be a result of too much optimism. Trump in February said of the coronavirus, “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” (As of March 25, the US has more than 55,000 confirmed cases, up from fewer than 100 at the beginning of March, according to Johns Hopkins University.)

In mid-March, as Trump more openly acknowledged the threat of coronavirus, he suggested that the country could pull back on social distancing efforts by Easter — in just a couple weeks. When pressed on why he chose that date, he did not cite any evidence or data. Instead, he said that Easter “is a beautiful time. It would be a beautiful timeline.” That timeline did not last long.

Trump has taken some steps as the pandemic has worsened

Trump initially focused his response to coronavirus on travel restrictions, first against China and most recently against Europe. While this likely bought the US a little time with China, the Trump administration didn’t use that time properly.

And in the case of Europe, the restrictions will likely do little to nothing. There’s one simple reason for that, Kates told me: “The virus is already here.” Since the coronavirus is already spreading within communities, the concern is no longer the virus coming in from outside the US.

Even conservatives have been critical of Trump’s response. The National Review editorial board wrote earlier this month:

[Trump] resisted making the response to the epidemic a priority for as long as he could — refusing briefings, downplaying the problem, and wasting precious time. He has failed to properly empower his subordinates and refused to trust the information they provided him — often offering up unsubstantiated claims and figures from cable television instead. He has spoken about the crisis in crude political and personal terms. He has stood in the way of public understanding of the plausible course of the epidemic, trafficking instead in dismissive clichés. He has denied his administration’s missteps, making it more difficult to address them.

In the face of all these criticisms, Trump has, at least in public, seemingly taken the crisis more seriously. He held an Oval Office address. He’s led daily press briefings. A White House task force released guidelines advising people to avoid public spaces and larger gatherings. His administration has, in light of declaring a national emergency, promised to take all sorts of actions to shore up coronavirus testing, health care capacity, and a tanking economy.

At the same time, Trump has continued to do things that conflict with what experts are saying. He’s hyped up an anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, that experts say we simply don’t have enough evidence for as an anti-coronavirus treatment. He’s downplayed experts’ warnings that social distancing may be necessary for months, instead suggesting that it may just be weeks. And instead of using press briefings to convey clear, actionable messages and let his own experts speak, Trump often uses his time at the podium to brag about unrelated issues and criticize the media as “fake news.”

Meanwhile, the actual policy response continues lagging behind. Beyond the lack of testing, experts often cite a shortage of medical equipment, such as ventilators, masks, gloves, and goggles. While the administration has said it’s using federal authorities and tapping into its stockpiles to get more of this gear to the places that need it, health care workers on the ground complain that they still don’t have enough — forcing them to reuse possibly contaminated equipment and choose between working in unsafe conditions or not show up to work at all. All of this at a time when the country needs to, according to experts, boost health care capacity.

“Even with the infusion of supplies from the strategic stockpile and other federal resources, there will not be enough medical supplies, including ventilators, to respond to the projected COVID-19 outbreak,” a March 21 letter from the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and American Nurses Association stated. “We have heard of health care providers reusing masks or resorting to makeshift alternatives for masks.”

Again, this reflects on the lack of preparedness: A shortage of medical equipment is one of the many problems government simulations and exercises warned about before the current outbreak. But Trump simply didn’t prioritize pandemic preparedness beforehand.

“The US … was not prepared,” Kates said. “A good preparedness plan would have helped address this and had things in place to allow for that increased need to be met.”

But the Trump administration didn’t quickly prioritize such efforts, even after it got warnings in January and February based on how coronavirus cases took off in China.

Other Trump policies could impact the pandemic

In the background of all of this, the Trump administration has continued to push for several policies that, while not obviously related to the coronavirus, experts caution could have a negative impact on the pandemic.

For one, Trump has continued pushing for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to reel back Medicaid with work requirements. With the outbreak growing, the US’s lack of universal health care has become an even more obvious problem: If people can’t get testing, they’re less likely to find out they have Covid-19 and take precautions to avoid spreading the virus. If they can’t get treatment in case of complications, they’re more likely to suffer, potentially spread the disease, and die.

The Trump administration seems aware of this problem, working with insurers to eliminate copayments for testing, stop surprise medical billing, and help expand coverage related to the coronavirus. But in many ways, the administration is working against problems that it’s also helping create by pushing to worsen access to health care.

The pandemic is “bringing to the fore the underlying challenges that we have in our health and social support system in the United States,” Kates said.

Another example: The administration has pushed forward on measures that will kick people off food stamps. This will not only lead people to suffer if they lose their jobs as a result of a coronavirus-caused recession, but it could lead to sick people going to work and spreading the disease, because they won’t have a safety net if they don’t bring in a paycheck.

“If you ask people who are very marginal and barely had enough money to put food on the table, if you ask them to not work and therefore not get paid, and choose between that and having to go to work and put themselves or others at risk, that’s a terrible choice,” Jha said. “And a lot of people are going to make ‘the wrong choice,’ and you’d understand why. This is not about just helping people economically; this is about fighting the virus.”

The Trump administration, for its part, appears to understand part of the problem here. He has signed a bill that’s providing economic relief to affected workers and Covid-19 patients — including paid leave, more food aid, and free testing — with more to come.

But his administration has also stuck to its other efforts to kick people off food stamps.

Experts also pointed to the “public charge” rule, which effectively discourages immigrants from seeking public services, including health care, by threatening their immigration status if they are “likely to be a public charge” by relying on those services.

“With an outbreak, that’s a recipe for potential disaster,” Kates argued. “You don’t want individuals to feel frightened about seeking the care that they need because they’re fearful of not being able to stay in the country or with their families. That would threaten the public’s health.”

Even if the administration doesn’t want to permanently back off these policy proposals, it could, Kates said, consider a moratorium. But so far, that’s not happening.

That reflects the lack of priority the Trump administration has given to the coronavirus pandemic, even as it rapidly worsens. If stopping the pandemic was the top priority, Trump could halt, even just temporarily, policies that could potentially worsen the crisis. But he’s not.

https://www.vox.com/,"Zoom, the videoconferencing app that’s dominating our coronavirus-created work, school, and social lives, is more popular than ever. With this popularity has come a wave of scrutiny, and Zoom’s new users have been joined by a lawsuit, a letter from a state attorney general, and accusations of shady privacy practices.

On Monday, Zoom found itself the recipient of not just a letter from New York Attorney General Letitia James but also a class action lawsuit, both over privacy issues that have been brewing since even before the coronavirus existed but which gained momentum once seemingly everyone began using it.

How lax security brought us “Zoombombing”

Zoom was released in 2013 and steadily climbed the videoconferencing app ranks, becoming one of the most popular business apps out there for the last several years. When the pandemic hit, forcing millions of workers and students to work remotely and friends and family members to interact virtually, many of them turned to Zoom. It is currently the most popular Apple and Android app in the world, and its stock price has more than doubled since late January — an especially impressive rise considering the stock market crash that also occurred during this time.

Leading up to the pandemic, Zoom suffered from several security issues, including a well-publicized vulnerability that could force Mac users that have (or ever had) Zoom installed on their device to join Zoom meetings with their cameras automatically activated. In January, cybersecurity firm Check Point found a way that a hacker could easily generate active meeting ID numbers, which they could then use to join meetings if the meetings weren’t password protected. Zoom instituted a number of changes to help fix the issue, but Check Point’s recommendation that meetings must be password protected was not.

So now we have “Zoombombing,” where public Zoom meetings are joined by a troll who broadcasts things like porn and Nazi imagery to the rest of the room. Public Zoom events that have been targeted must shut down to stop the broadcast. There are ways to mitigate this, such as password protecting meetings or limiting the screensharing setting to the meeting host. But the fact that it is so easy for anyone to join and then disrupt a public Zoom meeting at all indicates that Zoom’s developers didn’t anticipate the ways those meetings could be disrupted in the first place — something that anyone who has used the internet before really should have foreseen.

James, the New York Attorney General, sent Zoom a letter on Monday saying her office was “concerned” that Zoom’s security practices weren’t enough to handle its sudden boom in users, and it wanted to know what, if any, measures the company was taking to improve them. The New York Attorney General’s office also wanted to know what data the app collects about its users and why, and how it was following legal requirements to get consent from minor users.

Why Zoom’s privacy problems probably won’t ruin your day

Some of Zoom’s other recent sources of controversy, namely those related to privacy concerns, may have been blown out of proportion.

When its “attention tracking” feature was highlighted, many thought it allowed Zoom meeting hosts to secretly monitor their participants’ activities. The truth is less sensational: attention tracking can be turned on by the meeting host without participants’ knowledge. This can certainly feel like a privacy invasion. But Zoom told Recode that the feature is only enabled when the host is in screensharing mode, and it only tells the host which participants haven’t had its app in focus for 30 seconds or more. In other words, a meeting host can’t monitor everything the participants are doing on their computers — just when they stop looking at Zoom for a while. Even so, Zoom recently disabled the attention tracking feature.

Another recent dustup followed a Vice report last week that Zoom’s iOS app sends data back to Facebook through a software development kit, or SDK. (SDKs are packages of tools that developers use to build apps, and it’s very common for apps to have third-party SDKs that transmit information back to those third parties.) Facebook’s SDKs are some of the most popular in the world, mobile app intelligence service Apptopia told Recode, with at least a million apps using its most popular social SDK and at least half a million apps using its login SDK. The login SDK enables users to log in to Zoom through their Facebook accounts, and in Zoom’s case, it also sent basic device information back to Facebook, including the device’s model, app version, and cellphone service carrier.

It’s hard to know what Facebook was doing with this data. Cybersecurity company Bitdefender did find it unusual that the SDK sent this data back to Facebook even if the user didn’t log in through Facebook (or have a Facebook account at all). It did not tell Facebook which meetings the user joined or what was said in them. Zoom claimed it didn’t realize this information was being sent to Facebook and removed the SDK after Vice’s report. A class action lawsuit was filed several days later accusing Zoom of collecting and disclosing information about its users without properly notifying them.

The trouble doesn’t end there. On Tuesday, the Intercept reported that Zoom inaccurately claims that meetings can be “end-to-end encrypted.” In true end-to-end encrypted services like WhatsApp and Signal, the message content is encrypted even from the service provider. Zoom’s video chats can be seen by Zoom, although according to the Intercept, text chats in those meetings are truly end-to-end encrypted. The report triggered a letter to the company from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asking Zoom to explain, among other things, whether the service truly provides end-to-end encryption for video conferences.

Then, on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Zoom enabled a LinkedIn feature that, through names and email addresses, automatically associated Zoom users with their LinkedIn profiles, without their knowledge. Subscribers to LinkedIn’s Sales Navigator service could then immediately identify and access those users’ profiles during meetings. While Zoom once heralded this feature as “add[ing] tremendous value to Zoom,” it was removed shortly before the Times’ report was published.

What’s Zoom’s problem?

With its vaguely worded privacy policies and misleading marketing materials, Zoom’s real overarching issue seems to be a lack of transparency. This, combined with an apparent lack of forethought about how video meetings with insufficient privacy protections — both on the back and the front end — could be exploited by hackers or trolls. This entire scenario becomes especially problematic considering the growing number of students that Zoom eagerly recruits for the platform. Features that might have been appropriate or even welcome in the business settings Zoom thrived in are now seen as invasive, creepy, and unwelcome. It all seems like a bad publicity time bomb that went off as soon as Zoom became an essential piece of pandemic software and people started really looking more closely at how the service worked.

It remains to be seen just how damaging these reports will be. Some schools are already backing off using Zoom. Public schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, for example, announced on Monday night that they “can no longer use Zoom” for video calls. Then again, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, currently quarantined after contracting coronavirus, hosted a cabinet meeting over a (password protected) Zoom call on Tuesday. Perhaps Zoom is just too popular and necessary to fail now. Or maybe its problems are just beginning.

Update, April 2, 11:30 am: Updated to add more reports about Zoom’s privacy issues, the letter from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, and Zoom’s disabling of its attention tracking and LinkedIn Sales Navigator service.

https://www.vox.com/,"Editor’s note, April 2: There have been significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic since this story was last updated. Here is our latest information on the coronavirus and its fatality rate, as of this writing. For our most up-to-date coverage, visit our coronavirus hub.

In early March, before the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak had climbed to more than 4,500 people a few days later, the World Health Organization — for the first time — released a Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR).

It was not a modest estimate.

“Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19 cases have died,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press briefing. The rate describes the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases. It was greater than the previous coronavirus CFR estimate (2 percent in China), far higher than the seasonal flu (which kills 0.1 percent of those infected on average), and even worse than the Spanish flu pandemic (which killed an estimated 2 to 3 percent of those infected).

It’s no surprise that, very quickly, media around the world interpreted the news as evidence that the disease is deadlier than feared, and Twitter was buzzing with speculation about Covid-19’s real death rate. The number spread so far so fast, even President Trump took to Fox News on March 5 to try and tamp down the worry: “I think the 3.4 percent number is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, but based on a lot of conversations ... personally, I’d say the number is way under 1 percent.”

In the end, the 3.4 percent figure appears to have sowed more confusion than clarity. While a WHO spokesperson called the number “the current global ‘snapshot,’” it misled some: It was delivered without context, omitting key factors that determine a disease’s severity. In reality, we still don’t know Covid-19’s precise death rate — but we do have some guesses based on models that are more sophisticated than just dividing the deaths by cases.

Epidemiologists and disease modelers studying Covid-19 told Vox a more reliable global case fatality rate is about 1 percent — but there’s still a lot we have to learn about the disease. And even when we better understand how deadly this virus is, it’s likely to look pretty different country to country.

What we know about how deadly the coronavirus is

One key piece of information we still need is how many people in a population have the virus. That’s the denominator in the CFR equation.

When Tedros made his remarks, the WHO had recorded 3,112 deaths and 90,869 cases. Dividing the deaths by the cases, you get 3.4 percent. But that denominator is actually pretty fuzzy. So far, many countries — even those with sophisticated health systems, like the US — have struggled to get adequate testing up and running. And, to date, much of the focus has been on checking people who traveled to affected countries, not the broader population.

That means, in many places, health authorities are only picking up a subset of the sick — and perhaps the most severe cases, given that roughly 80 percent of people with Covid-19 have a mild case. (Remember: The sickest are usually the ones who show up at doctor’s offices and hospitals, while there may be hundreds or thousands of others with the virus who never show symptoms or don’t bother going to see a doctor. That’s why the CFR can often look much worse in the early days of an outbreak.)

Some of the countries that have done more widespread testing appear to have relatively fewer deaths in the case mix. In South Korea, for example, where thousands of people are tested every day, they’ve picked up more than 7,500 people with the virus. Among those, 54 have died. If we use the WHO’s method of calculating the CFR — and don’t take into account the potential problem of underestimating the number of mild cases out there — a crude case fatality estimate hovers under 1 percent.

Contrast that with the US: In early March, about 26 people had died and there were more than 750 known cases. That’s a crude CFR of about 3.4 percent. This doesn’t mean the virus is deadlier in the US; it’s more likely, once again, an artifact of undertesting or some other factor simply dividing deaths by cases doesn’t account for.

“When we see systems that are able to account for not only the really sick, but also those who have infection and are outpatients, the CFR is more accurate and drops considerably,” said Isaac Bogoch, a professor at the University of Toronto.

There are other problems with the 3.4 percent CFR: Global estimates hide regional variation that’ll likely emerge because of variations in health system capacity. Consider the death rate of the 2014-’16 Ebola epidemic. The disease was far deadlier in West Africa, where it hit some of the poorest countries, than it was in America, where nearly every person who fell ill had access to state-of-the-art treatment.

As of February 20, the WHO also reported lots of regional disparities in the disease’s deadliness even within China: 3.8 percent on average but 5.8 percent in Wuhan, Hubei province (where the virus first emerged), and 0.7 percent in other areas in China. (A WHO spokesperson acknowledged these regional differences and said we’re likely to see something similar “in different countries and outbreaks.”)

One final consideration: CFRs do change over time. That’s exactly what happened in China, as you can see in this figure from the WHO. Even the first and hardest-hit province, Hubei, saw its death rate tumble as public health measures were strengthened and clinicians got better at identifying and treating people with the disease:

As this pandemic threat wears on, we may also see more deaths — which could cause the CFR to increase if those mild cases don’t appear. “It takes a long time to die” from Covid-19, said University of Toronto epidemiologist David Fisman. “We estimate the length of stay in cases who died in ICU in China to be 28 days on average — three days in hospital and 25 days in ICU.”

But most experts anticipate the more we test for Covid-19, the more mild cases we’ll find. “To get a [true] rate, you need the deaths — which you can more reliably pick up — and you need cases, which you can less reliably pick up,” Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, summed up. “It’s not irresponsible to come out with that [3.4 percent] number, but it should have been more clearly interpreted as not being reliable, or at least mention it’ll vary in regions.”

A better way to calculate the Covid-19 death rate

The ideal way to arrive at an accurate CFR involves a survey of the populations affected to find out who has antibodies for the virus, including folks who didn’t even know they had it, said Maia Majumder of Boston Children’s Hospital. That’ll give experts the denominator, or the real case toll, in the CFR equation. “Until we’ve done [that] — and I’m sure it’ll happen sometime in the future — there are going to be some people that have mild infections or are asymptomatic infections that we’re not picking up.”

Case fatality rate (CFR) is time- & population-varying. Given that mild cases of #COVID19 are generally identified at a slower pace than severe cases AND that care standards (& demographics) vary across affected countries, responsible discussions about CFR *must* include context. https://t.co/ddqFt2P6Nv — Dr. Maia Majumder (@maiamajumder) March 4, 2020

As it stands, no such serology test has been completed, though China has approved at least two, and Singapore says it’s already using an experimental test to check for antibodies in patients there.

In the meantime, we have disease modelers that can give us a provisional portrait of Covid-19’s deadliness, accounting for things like the delay in the reporting of deaths and potential uncounted cases.

In a new but not-yet-peer-reviewed preprint out of Switzerland’s University of Bern, researchers did just that, using data on the outbreak from China’s CDC. They came up with an overall CFR of 1.6 percent — suggesting Covid-19 is less deadly than SARS, which had a CFR of around 10 percent. It’s also less than the WHO’s estimate.

Importantly, the researchers also found a wide variation across the age spectrum: Less than 1 percent of people in their 20s die from the virus, they estimated, while the rate shoots up to 18 percent for 80-year-olds.

“This 1.6 percent [figure] is based on a lot of assumptions we feel comfortable with, but it’s not hard data,” Julien Riou, a Bern research fellow and author on the paper, emphasized. “It’s more [an attempt] to correct the biases we know about.” It’s also based solely on China’s data — and, again, the outbreaks in other countries will likely play out differently.

So these figures are not only likely to change within China and outside over time — once we have better data, they’re going to look different depending on how strong a country’s health system is. But it’ll be a while before we know the true number of cases and have a better understanding of the deaths. Until then, when you see case fatality rates floating around, ask what they’re based on.",2

Given that mild cases of #COVID19 are generally identified at a slower pace than severe cases AND that care standards (& demographics) vary across affected countries, responsible discussions about CFR *must* include context. https://t.co/ddqFt2P6Nv — Dr. Maia Majumder (@maiamajumder) March 4, 2020

As it stands, no such serology test has been completed, though China has approved at least two, and Singapore says it’s already using an experimental test to check for antibodies in patients there.

In the meantime, we have disease modelers that can give us a provisional portrait of Covid-19’s deadliness, accounting for things like the delay in the reporting of deaths and potential uncounted cases.

In a new but not-yet-peer-reviewed preprint out of Switzerland’s University of Bern, researchers did just that, using data on the outbreak from China’s CDC. They came up with an overall CFR of 1.6 percent — suggesting Covid-19 is less deadly than SARS, which had a CFR of around 10 percent. It’s also less than the WHO’s estimate.

Importantly, the researchers also found a wide variation across the age spectrum: Less than 1 percent of people in their 20s die from the virus, they estimated, while the rate shoots up to 18 percent for 80-year-olds.

“This 1.6 percent [figure] is based on a lot of assumptions we feel comfortable with, but it’s not hard data,” Julien Riou, a Bern research fellow and author on the paper, emphasized. “It’s more [an attempt] to correct the biases we know about.” It’s also based solely on China’s data — and, again, the outbreaks in other countries will likely play out differently.

So these figures are not only likely to change within China and outside over time — once we have better data, they’re going to look different depending on how strong a country’s health system is. But it’ll be a while before we know the true number of cases and have a better understanding of the deaths. Until then, when you see case fatality rates floating around, ask what they’re based on.",2

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"In a climate of international conflict and turmoil, a disease begins to spread across the globe. It hits the United States on the way to becoming a worldwide pandemic. While most infected survive, the fatality rate is well above that of an ordinary flu. Eventually, one in three humans on earth is infected. At least 17 million people, and maybe as many as 100 million, perish.

This is not a prediction — it’s a description of how the influenza pandemic of 1918-’19 (which came to be erroneously known as the “Spanish flu”; more on that below) became one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, disease outbreak in modern history.

Comparisons to the 1918 outbreak have been rife since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in January. We recently marked the centennial of the 1918 pandemic, and fear of a repeat pervades discussions of the current outbreak.

But even granting that we are early in the history of the coronavirus outbreak, there are important differences between our current predicament and the Spanish flu. The underlying diseases are different, and from what we know at this point, the case fatality rate of the coronavirus is lower, by some estimates, than that of the Spanish flu. We also enjoy a much more robust public health infrastructure in 2019; in 1918, as Laura Spinney documents in her pandemic history Pale Rider, medical experts still hadn’t agreed that the flu is caused by a virus.

Other differences, like the advent of widespread passenger air travel and much deeper global supply chains, put us at greater pandemic risk now than in 1918.

But many experts caution that we should avoid comparisons to the Spanish flu. As flu expert Jeremy Brown writes in the Atlantic, “What’s most striking about these comparisons … is not the similarities between the two episodes, but the distance that medicine has traveled in the intervening century.”

Spinney concurs. “The Spanish flu is one of the worst, if not the worst, pandemic humanity ever went through, and it’s really anomalous in the history of flu pandemics,” she explains. “We’ve had 15 flu pandemics in the last 500 years, and the last five since the 1890s have been properly measured in a scientific way. None [but the Spanish flu] has killed more than 3 million people maximum.”

The “Asian flu” of 1957 and the “Hong Kong flu” of 1968, for instance, were both met with more modern tools of disease surveillance and had death tolls in the range of 500,000 to 2 million: big numbers, for sure, but hardly 1918 levels.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

A very, very brief history of the 1918 flu

As Spinney notes in Pale Rider, it can be difficult to pin down the exact origins of the 1918 influenza outbreak.

One theory has it starting on American soil, in Kansas, where it migrated from birds to humans. Albert Gitchell, an Army private and mess cook based in Fort Riley, Kansas, is sometimes identified as the first victim, reporting his symptoms on March 4, 1918. Unfortunately for the world, US soldiers at Fort Riley were at that point preparing for deployment to the Western Front of World War I.

A month later, Spinney writes, “the flu was epidemic in the American Midwest, on the cities of the eastern seaboard from which the soldiers embarked, and in the French ports where they disembarked.”

There are other theories, however. Spinney told me in a phone call that one theory tries to explain the unusual virulence of the 1918 flu by positing that it developed first in Europe’s trenches. Normally viruses decline in their deadliness over time because they need living hosts to keep spreading. That didn’t happen with the 1918 flu — perhaps, Spinney says, “because the virus might have got started in the trenches filled with young men who weren’t very mobile. They were stuck in the trenches like sardines for days, weeks, months. There was no evolutionary pressure for it to moderate its virulence.”

Whether it began in the trenches or ended up there after the arrival of American troops, the virus spread quickly to German soldiers and to neutral Spain. News of the flu was censored in most countries with war censorship regimes, leading authorities in Spain to erroneously think that it was alone in enduring such a brutal outbreak — hence the name “Spanish flu.” Russian POWs returning from Germany spread the disease to the newly created Soviet Union, and by May and June, various countries in Africa, as well as India, China, and Japan, all had outbreaks.

This is sometimes called the “first wave” of the flu, because while it had significant effects (particularly on World War I, where it weakened troops on both sides), it was not the debilitating crisis that we now remember as the Spanish flu.

The second wave, Spinney writes, began in August 1918 almost simultaneously in ports in Freetown, Sierra Leone; Brest, France; and Boston, Massachusetts. British imperial ships spread it around the country’s African holdings, and from South Africa it spread to the rest of the continent. In a matter of months, the flu was slowing down combat in Europe, spreading back to India, China, and Japan, and circulating through mass public celebrations of the war’s armistice on November 11.

Basically the only place not affected was Australia, but a “third wave” of the flu in late 1918 eventually hit there, too.

The second wave of the flu, in particular, had more brutal effects than typical influenza, not least because it was likelier than the ordinary flu to be joined by bacterial pneumonia. This, subsequent research has suggested, caused most of the deaths in the 1918 flu outbreak.

When all was said and done, the flu had killed between 17 million and 100 million. That’s a wide range. While today countries keep detailed records of testing and diagnosis for new outbreaks (as they’ve been doing during the coronavirus crisis), there was no such record-keeping capacity in the late 1910s. As such, research has to rely on estimates comparing actual mortality to a “baseline” level of mortality that would have occurred without the flu. Accurate actual death rates are hard enough to cobble together, given the unreliability of death records from the period, but estimating counterfactual deaths without the flu is harder still.

It’s hard to say when, exactly, the pandemic outbreak receded. The third wave, beginning in the winter of 1918-’19, subsided by that summer, and the virus likely lurked around for years, not causing pandemics because most survivors had been exposed and developed antibodies. The long-term health and economic costs were substantial. Economist Douglas Almond has estimated that people exposed in utero to the flu in 1918-’19 received less education, earned lower incomes, and were likelier to have disabilities than people who missed the pandemic in the womb.

Similarities and differences between the 1918 outbreak and now

The Spanish flu is frightening because it demonstrates that in a reasonably modern society, a pandemic killing tens of millions of people is very plausible. But that “reasonably modern” society was still much more primitive when it came to medicine and public health than the world of today.

Here are a few facts about public health in the year 1918:

We did not know that influenza is caused by a virus, and in fact the scientist Richard Pfeiffer had convinced most of the medical community that it was caused by bacteria; it wasn’t until 1933 that researchers proved conclusively that the flu is a viral infection.

Antibiotics capable of treating flu-related pneumonia infections (which are typically caused by bacteria) were 10 years from being discovered.

Antiviral drugs were many decades from being developed; the first came out in 1963.

There was no World Health Organization, and efforts to surveil and track the outbreak of new diseases were incredibly rudimentary.

Most countries in Europe were under war censorship regimes that limited the spread of accurate, lifesaving information about the flu outbreak.

For all the advances we’ve made since, what’s striking is how some of the measures authorities instituted at the time look very much like the ones we’re seeing with the coronavirus outbreak. Spinney told me, “They had the kind of social distancing measures that we’re still using today: isolation, quarantine, masks, hand-washing, staggering rush hour so you don’t have massive crowds in the metro and the streets. Those are techniques that are very ancient. People have always understood you have to keep the healthy and the sick separate.”

We must also weigh the massive strides in public health made since 1918 against the advent of global supply chains and passenger air travel. “We have a global population that is four times the size, and at least in the industrialized world, the populations are much older with respect to 1918, and old age weakens immune systems,” Spinney continues. All of that makes us more vulnerable, not less, to a pandemic like this. While antivirals are useful against coronavirus, we do not have a vaccine and will not for at least 18 months, somewhat limiting the public health value of our scientific advances over the last 100 years.

One way we can compare the two outbreaks is by looking at case fatality rates: the share of infections that lead to death. This is always difficult to estimate because there are likely more infections than have been identified by medical authorities. According to Johns Hopkins researchers, as of this writing there have been 111,363 cases of Covid-19 and 3,892 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 3.5 percent.

But you should take that number with a grain of salt. Countries’ testing protocols vary widely and many, including the US, have only tested a few thousand people while others, like South Korea, have tested hundreds of thousands. That means the denominator for the case fatality rate — the total number of infections — is uncertain, and might be undercounted due to lack of testing. In South Korea, the case fatality rate is currently 0.7 percent, suggesting that better testing might yield more accurate, lower rates. At the same time, as Julia Belluz explains, accurately measured fatality rates are also going to vary significantly from country to country due to differences in health system capacity, low- and middle-income people’s access to health care, etc.

The case fatality rate of the Spanish flu is often cited as 2.5 percent, but this is likely a dramatic underestimate, as science writer Ferris Jabr has written.

The most frequently cited death statistics for the Spanish flu come from Niall Johnson and Juergen Mueller’s 2002 study, which estimated the death toll at 50 million and warned that this might be as much as a 100 percent underestimate, implying a total toll of 100 million. A more recent 2018 paper by Pete Spreeuwenberg, Madelon Kroneman, and John Paget gets a much lower estimate of 17.4 million. If the frequently cited estimate of 500 million infections globally is correct, then the latter death toll implies a case fatality rate of 3.5 percent, but using a higher death toll of 50 million, the fatality rate rises to 10 percent.

This is a huge range of uncertainty. Given how imprecise our counts of total global infections for both the Spanish flu and coronavirus are and how imprecise our estimates for the former’s death toll are, it is hard to say anything definitive about how they stack up against each other in terms of case fatality.

The diseases also differed in whom they infected. The Spanish flu, unusually for an influenza, was less lethal for older people, perhaps because a similar 1830s flu outbreak granted older people still alive in 1918 some limited immunity. The coronavirus, by contrast, has had its most devastating impact in China on older people.

Both Covid-19 and the Spanish flu have already had massive effects outside of their immediate health consequences. The Spanish flu, many World War I historians agree, sped up the end of the war by weakening the ability of each side to field armies; it may even have affected the outcome, though the evidence there is weaker.

Covid-19’s economic effects might outstrip the Spanish flu’s, even if the health effects turn out to be milder, due to the economy’s move toward in-person services, hospitality, and globalized supply chains, all of which are vulnerable to an outbreak like this. Indeed, one effect in 1918 that is not likely to be repeated is an increase in wages in some countries due to a shortage of workers.

It’s natural to want to compare the two outbreaks, and it can be responsible to do so if the comparison is done with care and nuance. But it’s important to keep in mind just how severe the Spanish flu outbreak was, and that while Covid-19 could get much worse, it would have to infect several thousand times as many people as it has to date to match the Spanish flu’s reach. The Covid-19 situation may only get that bad if we fail to adequately adopt measures like social distancing, aggressive testing, and quarantining, and let it get that bad.

https://www.vox.com/,"Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Paul Gosar, and Rep. Doug Collins announced Monday plans to self-quarantine after interacting with an individual infected with the novel coronavirus at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in late February.

None of the three Republican lawmakers has exhibited any symptoms associated with Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but in Monday statements, each said that they have decided to isolate themselves out of “an abundance of caution.”

That Cruz, Gosar, and Collins had concerning contact at CPAC is striking considering many of the conference’s speakers worked to, as President Donald Trump has done, minimize the seriousness of the virus.

For example, US diplomat Mick Mulvaney — who at the time was the acting White House chief of staff — told attendees, “The reason you’re seeing so much attention to [the coronavirus] today is that [Democrats] think this is going to be what brings down the president. That’s what this is all about.”

And a number of attendees felt the same, like the woman who told Fox News’s Lawrence Jones coronavirus concerns were Democrats’ “next game.”

“You know, we go from one thing to the next,” she said. “This is after impeachment failed. Russia failed. So now this is what we’re doing.”

Now, however, there has been a shift in rhetoric. Saturday, the American Conservative Union (the group that puts on the conference) announced it had become aware of the Covid-19 case. It wrote in a statement, “During this time, we need to remain calm, listen to our health care professionals, and support each other.”

While Cruz, Gosar, and Collins say they have not seen signs of any symptoms, it is not clear whether the infected individual transmitted the virus to other attendees.

The infected attendee has not been named, but it appears the man had access to many of the conference’s highest-profile guests. Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union, has said he shook hands with him.

Schlapp, as the event’s face, shook hands with hundreds of other people, including Trump. And Cruz, Gosar, and Collins were all in contact with the infected individual as well — Gosar said in his statement he shook hands with the man “several times,” while Collins said he was in a photo with him.

All this has many CPAC attendees “apoplectic,” Raheem Kassam, editor-in-chief of the conservative outlet the National Pulse, wrote on Twitter Sunday. Kassam claims to be feeling ill after interacting with attendees who had contact with the infected man, including Gosar. And concerningly, Kassam said a number of the president’s closest advisers, allies, and one cabinet member were also in contact with the infected individual.

Amid all of this, Trump has continued to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus, and unlike the three GOP lawmakers who all — before they became aware of their exposure — advocated for hand-washing and other protective measures, has been dismissive of the idea he might need to alter his habits.

For instance, when asked Friday at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) if he was doing anything to protect himself from the coronavirus, Trump responded, “Not at all.”

And at a time when public health officials are asking people to cut down on shaking hands, Trump told reporters at the CDC he has no plans to stop doing so.

“If you’re a politician, like I walk in, and the doctors have their hands out, ‘Hello sir, how are you.’ If you don’t shake hands, they’re not going to like you too much,” he said, adding, “The fact is, I feel very secure.”

Trump is not secure, and the crisis at CPAC is a perfect encapsulation of why his rhetoric is dangerous

The disease is still rare in the US, but Trump is not secure from it. He, as he admitted at the CDC, shakes dozens of hands per day. He has been in contact with those exposed to the virus at CPAC, like Schlapp and Collins, but also those exposed elsewhere. For instance, both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended March’s AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) conference, at which two attendees have been confirmed to have Covid-19. And there are concerns Pence may have been exposed to the virus during a visit to Florida.

And Trump — as well as many members of his inner circle — is part of the demographic public health officials have said need to exercise the most caution about the virus.

“If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Meet the Press Sunday.

We don’t know much about the president’s health other than what he and his administration tell us (namely that he is healthy, and in his words, that he has a “gorgeous chest” containing a healthy heart), but we do know his age: He is 73 years old.

Fauci said Sunday the older population and those with existing health conditions should “say no [to] large crowds, no [to] long trips. And above all, don’t get on a cruise ship.”

Trump, however, is saying yes to large crowds.

“I’m not concerned at all,” Trump said Saturday in response to reports of the CPAC Covid-19 case and added, despite coronavirus concerns, “We’ll hold tremendous rallies.”

But White House staff is becoming increasingly concerned, the Washington Post’s Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey, and Juliet Eilperin reported Monday. They note staffers are considering reducing Trump’s travel to comply with the CDC recommendation that senior citizens limit their time on airplanes, and while Trump has held rallies ahead of Democratic primaries in recent weeks, he does not have a rally scheduled for Monday evening — or any rallies on his calendar in the immediate future.

And even officials who vouched for Trump’s vigor have begun to temper their comments.

For instance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Sunday, Trump “sleeps less than I do and he’s healthier than what I am.”

Here's Surgeon General Jerome Adams telling Jake Tapper that President Trump ""sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am."" pic.twitter.com/bDpQWWAgUU — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 8, 2020

The president was apparently so pleased with the statement he retweeted the above clip tweeted by my colleague Aaron Rupar.

But Monday, Adams — who is decades younger than the president — said the statement was “wrong,” tweeting “I made a poor attempt at self deprecating humor based on my own well documented chronic medical issues - I in fact take five times as many meds as the president currently reportedly does. I should not have made this comparison.”

But the president’s retweet and his other statements about the virus are good reminders that — whether he is personally in danger of infection or not — his flippant attitude toward the virus is putting others in danger.

His claims that criticism of his coronavirus response are part of a Democratic “hoax” against him inspires many — like the CPAC attendee Jones interviewed — to believe the same. And in believing that, she placed herself in a crowded public place at a time when experts are advising people to do the opposite. Having done so, she inadvertently exposed herself to the coronavirus, and — had she become infected with it — would have exposed all she came into contact with.

But beyond issues of the president’s words affecting person-to-person spread, his tendency to pat himself on the back has made it appear that all that needs to be done to limit the virus has been done.

He has often promoted the fact that he limited travel; he wrote on Twitter Sunday, for instance, “We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend.”

But experts say the president’s travel ban was misplaced and that by focusing on that, preparations to ensure the availability of testing and to slow the spread of community transmission seem to have fallen through the cracks.

“Travel bans and overseas quarantines and travel screening and so on are not going to offer us much protection anymore,” former director of the USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance Jeremy Konyndyk told Vox’s Alex Ward. “The main driver of transmission now is going to be community transmission, which is likely already ongoing in numerous places around the country. That needs to be the central focus of the policy now.”

For some administration officials — like Fauci — that does indeed seem to be the focus. Fauci told Meet the Press’s Chuck Todd public health officials will make understanding and limiting community spread as well as developing mitigation strategies their priorities in the next three months.

But for Trump, the focus has been very different. Monday morning, the president again minimized Covid-19 by pointing out the flu has killed more people.",2
https://www.vox.com/,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

“America will again, and soon, be open for business,” President Donald Trump said on Monday. “Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”

The cure, in this case, is social distancing, and the mass economic stoppage it forces. The problem is Covid-19, and the millions of deaths it could cause. On Tuesday, Trump accelerated his timeline. He said he’d like to see normalcy return by Easter Sunday, which is April 12. “Wouldn’t it be great to have all the churches full?” he asked. “You’ll have packed churches all over our country.”

Public health experts reacted with horror. But the question Trump is posing needs to be taken seriously. The costs of social distancing are tremendous. The economic forecasts now predict a GDP drop and an unemployment rate of Great Depression-level proportions. The human suffering that will be unleashed is real, and it is vicious.

It feels cold and inhuman to ask the question: “How many lives is economic growth worth?” But we ask — and answer — it constantly, even if we rarely admit it. Millions die from pollution and car accidents, byproducts of our industrial economy and transportation networks. We could close the factories, block the roads, and save those lives. But we don’t. As Trump often points out, tens of thousands die each year of the flu, but California doesn’t shutter its restaurants.

Moreover, mass economic suffering poses its own dangers, both physical and political. “Right now, people are stunned by what is happening,” Frances Lee, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, wrote to me in an email. “But they will wake up soon and realize that they have been ruined economically.” When that happens, she worries, it will be “a profound threat to social peace.” Epidemiological models forecast the path of disease, not the stability of societies. Add that into the model and perhaps the cost-benefit analysis changes.

Lurking at the center of this debate is an imagined world where we let Covid-19 rip through the population, killing millions and hospitalizing far more, but younger, healthier Americans keep the economy humming along as normal. “Let’s get back to work, let’s get back to living,” said Texas’s Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. “Let’s be smart about it. Those of us who’re 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves. But don’t sacrifice the country.”

But many — myself included — question whether that’s realistic. As Bill Gates put it, “it’s very tough to say to people, ‘Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner. We want you to keep spending because there’s maybe a politician who thinks GDP growth is all that counts.’”

The thinking being framed here as a grim acceptance of the economy’s primacy is questioned by top economists as both morally and empirically misguided.

“Look, I’m an economist and I am gruesomely comfortable with putting a value on a life,” says Jason Furman, who teaches economic policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Obama. “If it costs one hundred million dollars to save a life, and we have a limited budget, it may not be not worth it. But I think the right model right now isn’t that you’re trading lives off against better economic performance. It’s that if you don’t save those lives, you might have even worse economic performance.”

Related How Trump plans to relax social distancing guidelines

The true choice, Furman argues, is this: You can suppress the virus now and deal with a terrible economy six months from now, or you can wait two more months to suppress the virus, find yourself forced into yet more extreme quarantine measures because the virus is pervasive and the death toll overwhelming, and find yourself in an even more horrendous economy on the other side.

Before we pit economic growth against human life, in other words, we need to be sure whether that’s truly the choice we’re facing. “We’re not necessarily having a moral disagreement,” says Ruth Faden, the founder of Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. “If you’ve got very different empirical views of how this is going to play out, what looks like a moral disagreement ends up being a disagreement about probabilities and contingencies.”

This is a debate worth having, but it needs to be had with a lot more clarity, and a lot more rigor. So let’s have it.

Imagining the unimaginable

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization warned that America was becoming the new epicenter of the pandemic. If you plot new cases in the US against the path the disease has followed in other countries, we’re on track for the worst Covid-19 outbreak in the world.

Responsible epidemiologists will tell you not to extrapolate crudely: When caseloads rise rapidly, societies respond, imposing harsh social distancing measures to slow the spread of the disease. That’s how the curves bent in other nations, they say, and it’s how it’ll bend in America, too.

But America, unusually, is led by a president advocating the opposite: Caseloads are rocketing upward, and he wants to pull back on suppression measures within two weeks.

Imagine if we did. On April 12, the Trump administration, as well as every state and locality, lifts the social distancing guidelines. Restaurants reopen. Church pews are packed. Bars throw “F the coronavirus” parties. The virus accelerates. Hospitals are quickly overwhelmed — which means the virus becomes more lethal, as people who need ventilators can’t get them. But it’s not just the virus that becomes more lethal. All medical emergencies become more lethal, because the ICUs are packed and there are critical shortages of doctors and nurses.

In a scenario like that, it’s entirely possible that the coronavirus would infect 60 percent of the country, with a case fatality rate of 1.5 percent, in a matter of months. That would mean almost 3 million deaths directly from coronavirus — roughly three times as many Americans as have died in every war we’ve ever fought combined. And that doesn’t count the deaths indirectly caused by coronavirus. With hospitals in lockdown, people would cease seeking care for chest pain, they’d put off needed surgeries, they’d try to treat at home what they would once have asked a doctor to diagnose. Many of them would die.

I have focused here on deaths, but suffering matters, too. As Scott Gottlieb, Donald Trump’s former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, notes, Covid-19 is a brutal illness that forces hospitalization and even ICU admission in a large proportion of cases, even among the young.

While vast majority of deaths from #COVID19 are age 60+ many young adults and middle aged Americans are becoming seriously ill and surviving only after prolonged hospitalizations and ICU admissions that have long term consequences. This is a dangerous virus for most age groups. pic.twitter.com/jVYWFatTDM — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) March 23, 2020

It’s absurd to think that Americans under age 65 would go about their lives as normal, risking a disease that could force them into the ICU when the ICUs are full. And what about those of us who have immunosuppressed partners, or who want to visit our parents?

This is why so many economists are skeptical of arguments that pit the economy against the virus. They worry that if you let the virus rage unchecked, you’ll get both a worse epidemic and a worse economy.

On Thursday, a group of economic luminaries, including the past two Federal Reserve chairs, and chief economists and Treasury secretaries from both Democratic and Republican administrations, released a letter arguing that the path back to a functional economy runs through sound public health measures. “Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now; we will hasten the return to robust economic activity by taking steps to stem the spread of the virus and save lives,” they wrote.

New research offers historical support for that argument. Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner looked at the areas of the United States that were hit hardest by the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The cities that deployed social distancing measures earliest and most aggressively fared better, on both health and economic measures, than the cities with slower, weaker responses. Social distancing interventions, the authors conclude, “can reduce mortality while at the same time being economically beneficial.”

There is an aesthetic of toughness to making the argument, right now, that we could keep calm and carry on in the face of an unchecked plague. But if you force yourself to imagine that world deeply, the counterfactual breaks down. There’s no normal economy, or normal polity, amid that kind of mass death. “It’s an unreal realism,” says Adam Tooze, an economic historian at Columbia University who studies financial crises. “In practice, what that will do is create such a catastrophic collapse in employment and business activity that it will be completely untenable as an economic policy or politically.”

Trump is making this argument now, when the economic and political pain of social distancing is present but the horror of 20 million coronavirus infections isn’t. As Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put it, “Try running an economy with major hospitals overflowing, doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can’t help all, and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms, on TV, on social media, and shown all around the world. There is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.”

What’s the social distancing endgame?

If the leading voices in the “carry-on” crowd have offered a false choice, part of the reason it’s taken hold is that the social distancing crowd has, too often, offered no choice at all.

I live in the Bay Area, in northern California. We were the first locality to impose shelter-in-place rules. Those rules — their severity and their urgency — were clearly communicated. But despite closely following the news, I have no idea what is supposed to happen on April 7, when the order ends. Will it be renewed? Did we use this time to radically increase the number of hospital beds and ventilators? Do we have the capacity for mass testing, such that we can move toward something like the models we see in Taiwan or South Korea?

Social distancing itself is not a cure. This becomes sharply clear in the influential Imperial College report modeling different paths for the outbreak (with added commentary here). Yes, social distancing works to slow transmission. But the disease roars back when the restrictions ease. “This type of intensive intervention package — or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission — will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) — given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed,” the authors write.

So let’s put this clearly: Comparing the cure and the disease is a false choice in both directions. If you let the disease rage, you don’t save the economy. But if you lock down the economy, you don’t cure the disease. It is understandable, in the initial panic to slow the disease, that public health messaging has emphasized the importance of social distancing, but in order to keep people bought into that strategy, it’s necessary to be clear about what comes after.

Extreme social distancing measures buy time. That’s time that needs to be used for four things: Bringing the disease’s reproduction rate down so the caseloads begin to fall. Surging health supply to handle the infections we already have and currently expect. Massively expanding testing capacity so we can track the disease going forward. And passing enough support and stimulus measures so people can survive this period economically, not just epidemiologically.

Together, these policies could, as the Center on Global Development’s Jeremy Konyndyk told Vox, move us from “sledgehammer” to “scalpel.” Or, as entrepreneur Tomas Pueyo has put it in a viral series of Medium posts, “the hammer and the dance”:

If that’s done well, we could move toward a phase more like what we see in Taiwan: constant vigilance and large-scale testing, the reimposition of social distancing if cases get out of hand, but normalcy most of the time, for most of the population.

That is not a sunny vision of our immediate future, but these are not sunny times. “This is one of the most significant crises that the world has ever faced in terms of the numbers of lives that could be lost and the destruction to the economies globally and nationally that will result,” says Faden. We will not escape it unscathed, and no one should pretend otherwise. But the choices we make in the coming days will decide whether it is difficult or disastrous.

The grim truth, for those of us living under tight lockdowns right now, is it’s not clear that the time we’ve bought is being used well. Social distancing is likely slowing disease transmission, but there’s little evidence that the country has been sufficiently swift in surging health and testing capacity. Indeed, governors of key states are saying, daily, that they’re not getting the support they need.

Since the beginning I’ve promised you transparency and honesty on all aspects of our response.



To that end, I want to take a moment now to run you through our PPE requests with the federal government, and what we’ve received from them. pic.twitter.com/SsOw1l4UKF — Governor JB Pritzker (@GovPritzker) March 23, 2020

Konyndyk says we need a “Manhattan Project effort to get this stuff in place in really a two-or three-month period.” So far, we aren’t seeing one.

This is where presidential leadership really matters. If Trump had put the full weight of his presidency, and of the federal government, behind a well-sequenced coronavirus response plan, the country could understand what their sacrifice was being used for and feel confident that there was an endgame.

Instead, the opposite is happening. Trump spent a couple of days acting like the president, but he quickly reverted to his more traditional behavior of hammering his enemies and blaming the media for his problems.

The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2020

That most every affected country in the world either reacted more swiftly than America, or has imposed more aggressive social distancing, makes clear how dangerous it is for Trump to treat public health recommendations like a conspiracy against his reelection campaign. Israelis, for instance, are being told to stay within 100 yards of their homes or face fines or even imprisonment. Does Trump believe that’s because Benjamin Netanyahu is watching too much MSNBC?

Rather than make the country’s sacrifices count, Trump is telling Americans we’ve already sacrificed too much, for too long. This is a moment that demands social solidarity, but all Trump knows is fracture. This is a moment that requires long-term thinking and sacrifice, but Trump acts on the timeline of the cable news segment in front of him. It is perhaps the most stunning and dangerous abdication of presidential leadership in the modern era.

“When the president stands on top of a table and says, ‘This is super important, super urgent, everyone must do this,’ the government works moderately effectively,” says Ron Klain, who managed the Obama administration’s Ebola response. “That’s the best case. When the president is standing up and saying, ‘I don’t want to hear about it. I don’t want to know about it, this doesn’t really exist,’ well, then you’re definitely not going to get effective work from the government.”

An irony of the coronavirus crisis is that if we managed it well, it would likely feel to the public that the sacrifice wasn’t worth it. Politicians don’t get credit for the lives they saved, for the catastrophes they averted, but they do get punished for the pain they cause. An ideal response would make the cost of disease suppression visible even as it lured people into a false sense that the virus’s threat was overstated. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, put it, “if it looks like you’re overreacting, you’re probably doing the right thing.”

But what we are barreling toward right now is much worse: an inept, fumbling response in which we fully experience the virus’s toll — in which millions die and the economy freezes and we find ourselves dearly wishing we had understood the choices better, and made the hard decisions earlier.

Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

https://www.vox.com/,"France and Germany, Europe’s two most powerful countries, have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with each approaching 150,000 confirmed cases. But as of April 17, France is near 18,000 dead from the infection, while Germany’s death toll has passed 4,000.

Which raises the question: How did two similarly sized countries, located right next to each other and with comparable levels of wealth and resources, end up with such starkly different outcomes?

The answer has a lot to do with how their respective governments responded to the crisis.

France had the continent’s first confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but the French government failed for weeks to take decisive action to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing. Germany, on the other hand, immediately began aggressively testing and tracking people with symptoms.

Now, France is under lockdown and has just extended it until May 11 at least. Meanwhile, Germany plans to reopen part of its economy next week.

The experiences of these two countries show that just having substantial national wealth and high-quality health care systems isn’t enough to keep citizens safe from the deadly coronavirus. Saving lives is also about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.

“Countries that were slow to respond have, so far, paid the price,” Thomas Bollyky, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told me last month.

If there’s a lesson for world governments, then, it’s to be more like Germany — not France.

How Germany kept its coronavirus death rate so low

It’s not surprising that Germany has the world’s fifth-largest coronavirus outbreak. It’s in the middle of Europe and nearly borders Italy, which early on in the crisis became the continent’s epicenter. If the disease was going to spread, Germany was always going to be a likely victim.

What wasn’t predetermined, though, was its low death rate. That result came from a combination of luck and the government’s quick action.

Let’s start with the luck part.

Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told me that the country’s earliest coronavirus carriers were skiers returning home from Austria and Italy. Health authorities say that older adults, especially those over 60 years old, are at risk of severe complications. Most skiers, however, don’t fit that age demographic. While some still got sick, then, the chance they would die from the disease was low.

That trend continues: The average age of an infected person in Germany is 49 years old, compared to about 62.5 years old in France.

It also helped that the vast majority of early cases were clustered in the western region of Heinsberg. That just happens to be near top German hospitals in Bonn, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and other cities, which means those patients were able to access the best care.

But young carriers in the area, even if they were asymptomatic, could spread the disease around the country to more vulnerable people. Why didn’t that happen on a wide scale?

Two words: testing and tracking.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” Christian Drosten, the chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, told the New York Times this month.

Germany has Europe’s best pharmaceutical industry, allowing it to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. In the case of Covid-19, German laboratories started accumulating testing kits as signs of a global spread became more real in early 2020. These labs were well stocked ahead of Germany’s first confirmed coronavirus case in February.

The Robert Koch Institute’s Degen told me that early testing helped the country’s public health officials get a better understanding of where the outbreaks were and how far the disease had spread before things got out of control. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, and many cases, and also mild ones,” she said.

This also helps explain why the number of confirmed cases is so high but the number of deaths so small: hundreds of thousands are getting tested each week, and the vast majority of them won’t have a life-threatening case. Every subsequent test, then, makes the infection-to-death ratio smaller and smaller.

But that’s not all: Germany has also gone the extra mile to track those with the disease.

In the city of Heidelberg, for example, the New York Times reports that vehicles known locally as “corona taxis” transport physicians to the homes of those who have been sick for five to six days.

“They take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins,” the New York Times’s Katrin Bennhold wrote.

This not only helps authorities keep tabs on a known patient, but also enables them to intervene at a critical point in the disease’s progression, thereby reducing the chances of death.

“Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,” Hendrik Streeck, who leads the University of Bonn’s virology institute, told the New York Times.

It appears Germany plans to keep up intense tracking for the foreseeable future. “Once...we are down to, let’s say, a couple of hundred cases per day or even better, less than a hundred cases, we will try to follow up on every case and get in touch with everyone who has been in touch with those new cases, quarantine and test them,” Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist at the University of Cologne, told CNBC on April 3.

Of course, many experts I spoke to warned that the situation could still worsen in Germany.

Degen told me that “the [death] rate has been steadily rising” — it’s roughly at 3 percent now — “and we expect it to further do so.” She added that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

That means Germany isn’t out of the woods yet. But it’s in a better position than most because it had good fortune and the good sense to start testing early and often.

France, on the other hand, had none of that.

How France bungled its coronavirus response

France, like Germany, is a wealthy country with a great healthcare system. It doesn’t have the pharmaceutical prowess of its neighbor, experts tell me, but still has good hospitals with thousands of ICU beds and well-trained physicians.

If you were to list the countries best prepared, at least in theory, to weather the coronavirus outbreak, France would surely be near the top.

And yet that’s not what happened.

That’s in large part because French President Emmanuel Macron and his team completely missed their chance to quash the disease early on.

Macron even admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

To understand just how badly Macron’s government bungled the country’s coronavirus response, it helps to go back to the beginning.

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And even as Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping, few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

In fact, in early March, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests. As Politico reported last week, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

Macron, in effect, seemed to be sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s border with Germany. One of the congregants carried the disease.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Put it all together, and it becomes clear that in addition to its early luck with younger carriers, Germany’s ability to test early, track often, and treat patients thoroughly has kept its death toll down despite a large number of confirmed infections. France, meanwhile, dawdled on implementing significant measures, especially testing, for weeks.

The contrast shows how vital swift, aggressive measures are for combating the disease. The hope is that other nations learn that lesson as the virus continues to sweep across the globe.

https://www.vox.com/,"For much of the past month, some commentators have defended the effort to promote social distancing, including the near-shutdown of huge swaths of America’s economy, as the lesser of two evils: Yes, asking or forcing people to remain in their homes for as much of the day as possible will slow economic activity, the argument goes. But it’s worth it for the public health benefits of slowing the coronavirus’s spread.

This argument has, naturally, led to a backlash, explained here by my colleague Ezra Klein. Critics — including the president — have argued that the cure is worse than the disease, and mass death from coronavirus is a price we need to be willing to pay to keep the American economy from cratering.

Both these viewpoints obscure an important possibility: The social distancing regime may well be optimal not just from a public health point of view, but from an economic perspective as well.

Economists Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner released a working paper (not yet peer-reviewed) last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively. The three analyzed the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in the United States, as the closest (though still not identical) analogue to the current crisis. They compare cities in 1918-’19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later.

Their conclusion? “We find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over.”

The researchers refer to such social distancing policies as NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions,” essentially public health interventions not achieved through medication, like quarantines and school and business closures. The key to the paper is their observation that, in theory, NPIs can both decrease economic activity directly, by keeping people in certain jobs from going to work, and increase it indirectly, because it prevents large-scale deaths that would also have a negative impact on the economy.

“While NPIs lower economic activity, they can solve coordination problems associated with fighting disease transmission and mitigate the pandemic-related economic disruption,” they write. In other words, social distancing measures that save lives can also, in the end, soften the economic disruption of a pandemic.

The data here comes from a 2007 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, where a group of researchers chronicled what specific policies were put in place between September 8, 1918, and February 22, 1919, by 43 different cities. The most common NPI the JAMA researchers identified was a combination of school closures and bans on public gatherings; 34 of the 43 cities adopted this rule, for an average of four weeks.

Other cities eschewed these policies in favor of mandatory isolation and quarantine procedures: “Typically, individuals diagnosed with influenza were isolated in hospitals or makeshift facilities, while those suspected to have contact with an ill person (but who were not yet ill themselves) were quarantined in their homes with an official placard declaring that location to be under quarantine,” the JAMA authors write, detailing New York City’s approach.

Another 15 cities did both isolation/quarantines and school closures/public gathering bans.

The 2007 paper found a strong association between the number and duration of NPIs and pandemic deaths, with more and longer-lasting NPIs associated with a smaller death toll. Correia, Luck, and Verner, in their new paper, replicate this finding.

But they take it a step further. They study the impact of changes in mortality due to the 1918 pandemic on economic outcomes.

“The increase in mortality from the 1918 pandemic relative to 1917 mortality levels (416 per 100,000) implies a 23 percent fall in manufacturing employment, 1.5 percentage point reduction in manufacturing employment to population, and an 18 percent fall in output,” they conclude. In other words, a big outbreak spelled economic disaster for affected cities.

Then they combined this analysis with an analysis of the effects of NPI policies. They find that the introduction of social distancing policies is associated with more positive outcomes in terms of manufacturing employment and output. Cities with faster introductions of these policies (one standard deviation faster, to be technical) had 4 percent higher employment after the pandemic had passed; ones with longer durations had 6 percent higher employment after the disaster.

The takeaway is clear: These policies not only led to better health outcomes, they in turn led to better economic outcomes. Pandemics are very bad for the economy, and stopping them is good for the economy.

A few notes of caution

It’s important to always approach this kind of study with a degree of skepticism. The 1918 pandemic was not a planned experiment, so researchers’ ability to determine the degree to which the pandemic, or the policies adopted in response to it, affected economic outcomes is always going to be somewhat limited.

The researchers acknowledge that their biggest limitation is the non-randomness of policy adoption by cities. Presumably cities with strict responses to the pandemic were different from cities with laxer responses in ways that went beyond this one incident. Maybe the stricter cities had better public health infrastructure to begin with, for instance, which could exaggerate the estimated effect of social distancing interventions.

The authors argue that because the second and most fatal wave of the 1918 pandemic spread mostly from east to west, geographically, these kinds of dynamics weren’t at play. “Given the timing of the influenza wave, cities that were affected later appeared to have implemented NPIs sooner as they were able to learn from cities that were affected in the early stages of the pandemic,” they note.

The best explanation of differences in policies, then, is how far a city is from the East Coast of the US. They control for a big factor that might affect Western states more (the boom and bust of the agricultural industry as World War I drew to a close) and find few other observable differences between Western cities with strong policies and Eastern policies with weak ones. But the notion that these cities are comparable is a key part of the paper’s research design, and one worth digging into as the paper goes through peer review and revisions.

The economy isn’t everything

The message that there isn’t a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy is reassuring. If there were such a trade-off, the debate over coronavirus response would be in the realm of pure values: How much money should we be willing to forsake to save a human life? That’s a thorny choice, and finding that we don’t actually have to make it — as this paper suggests — is comforting.

It’s worth emphasizing, though, that if we did have to make that choice, it would still be an easy decision. The lives saved would be worth more.

In another recent white paper, UChicago’s Michael Greenstone and Vishan Nigam estimate the social value of social distancing policies, relative to a baseline where we endure an untrammeled pandemic. To simulate the two scenarios, they rely on the influential Imperial College London model of the coronavirus pandemic — a paper that found that an uncontrolled spread of coronavirus would kill 2.2 million Americans.

Then they throw in an oft-used tool of cost-benefit economic analysis: the value of a statistical life (VSL). Popularized by Vanderbilt economist Kip Viscusi, VSL involves putting a dollar value on a human life by estimating the implicit value that people in a given society place on continuing to live based on their willingness to pay for services that reduce their risk of dying.

Usually, this involves a “revealed preferences” approach. A 2018 paper by Viscusi, for example, used, among other data sources, Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries to measure how much more, in practice, US workers demand to be paid to take jobs that carry a higher risk of death.

Greenstone and Nigam allow VSL to vary with age — understandably, older people are less willing to pay to reduce their odds of death than younger people — but set the average VSL for an American age 18 and over to $11.5 million.

Based on the Imperial College projection that social distancing would save about 1.76 million lives over the next six months, Greenstone and Nigam estimate that the economic value of the policy is $7.9 trillion, larger than the entire US federal budget and greater than a third of GDP. The value is about $60,000 per US household. Even if the Imperial College model is off by 60 percent and the no-social-distancing scenario is less deadly than anticipated, the aggregate benefits are still $3.6 trillion. And this is likely an underestimate that ignores other costs of a large-scale outbreak to society; it focuses solely on mortality benefits.

VSL is sometimes attacked from the left as craven, a reductio ad absurdum of economistic reasoning trampling over everything, including the value of human life itself. But coronavirus helps illustrate how VSL can work in the opposite direction. Human life is so valuable in these terms that social distancing would have to force a 33 percent drop in US GDP before you could start to plausibly argue that the cure is worse than the disease.

That social distancing likely won’t cause a reduction in GDP relative to a scenario where there’s a multimillion-person death toll, as indicated by the 1918 flu paper, makes the case for distancing policies that much stronger.

https://www.vox.com/,"The coronavirus has now killed more Americans than the 9/11 terror attacks — and the death toll is poised to rise in the weeks ahead.

Nearly 3,000 people died after terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and a third plane that had been hijacked crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on 9/11. According to tallies by both CNN and the New York Times, over 3,000 people in the US infected with Covid-19 have died.

It is, of course, not a neat comparison. Those who perished on 9/11 died instantly or soon thereafter, though many first responders suffered major complications in the subsequent years. Meanwhile, the death toll from the coronavirus has risen since January and has grown substantially in the past few weeks.

Top health officials in the US government, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, predicted on Sunday between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the country before the crisis subsides. Dr. Deborah Birx, another medical professional leading the American response, said the following day that Fauci’s figures could pan out even “if we do things almost perfectly.”

President Donald Trump, a longtime New Yorker who only last year changed his official residence to Florida, seems to agree. If the death toll stays around 100,000, then “we all together have done a very good job,” he said during a Sunday press conference.

But one parallel between the coronavirus crisis and 9/11 is that, so far, New York City has borne the brunt of two of the worst crises in recent American history. Steven Kassapidis, an intensive care unit doctor in the city, told the Guardian last week that “9/11 was nothing compared to this.” Current conditions are “Hell. Biblical,” he continued.

With regard to 9/11, he said, “We were waiting for patients to come who never came, okay? Now, they just keep coming.”

That tracks with what Vox’s Jen Kirby and Emily Stewart reported last week:

Officials are frantically trying to find spaces to care for the New Yorkers they expect to become sick. The US Army Corps of Engineers is planning to build field hospitals at now-empty colleges on Long Island, and to remake the Jacob Javits Center, the convention center on the far west side of Manhattan, into a FEMA hospital. De Blasio said Thursday the city is trying to triple its capacity to 60,000 beds by May. That still may not be enough.

The USNS Comfort, the US Navy’s hospital ship, has now docked outside Manhattan for the first time since the 9/11 attacks.

The last time this ship docked in Manhattan was in the aftermath of 9/11. It's getting harder to avoid drawing parallels between the two crises. https://t.co/MkL67H2pkY — Richard Hall (@_RichardHall) March 30, 2020

Of course, the greatest devastation of the coronavirus is likely yet to come, whereas the destruction from 9/11 was immediate.

Another similarity is that President George W. Bush had ample intelligence informing him that al-Qaeda was planning an attack like 9/11, and Trump had multiple government agencies warning the US wasn’t prepared for a pandemic. Yet neither took sufficient steps to try to prevent the respective threats from unfolding. In Trump’s case, his administration was slow to deal with the outbreak, failing to administer tests early and deliver medical equipment to health care workers treating patients.

The sluggish response has already led at least one member of the 9/11 Commission — the government-mandated group that investigated the origins of the attack and the US government’s failures — to call for a similar effort once the crisis is over.

“As with prior catastrophic failures of the government to protect the American public,” John Farmer Jr. wrote on Saturday for ABC News, “the public will demand — and good government will require — an accounting of the actions and inactions that contributed to the world’s — and our nation’s — failure to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Some national security experts have even begun to argue that the US government needs to dramatically rethink what the greatest threats to America really are — moving terrorism down the list and putting global health near the top.

“I can say definitively that the specter of 9/11 has impacted every major political decision tied to US involvement in Afghanistan, with the risk of enabling another such an attack weighing heavily on senior leaders,” Jason Campbell, who from 2016 to 2018 was a top Afghanistan policy official in the Pentagon, told me. “I believe we will see a similar effect when it comes to countering another pandemic.”

Should the US focus more on global health than terrorism?

In a piece for Politico over the weekend, foreign affairs journalist Nahal Toosi compared the US foreign policy community to a high school cafeteria. The popular kids were those who focused on terrorism, among other things, while “the global health specialists would be eating tater tots in the corner with the band geeks.”

The coronavirus may soon flip that hierarchy on its head.

“I think this is a breakpoint, a transformative moment that is going to change institutions,” Stephen Morrison, who leads a global health program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, told Toosi. “You’re going to have a hard time to find people [who] argue again that this really is not all that important.”

Campbell, who’s now at the RAND Corporation, echoed that sentiment. “In the coronavirus context, much like with Afghanistan or even counterterrorism more broadly, there is going to be added political risk associated with underpreparing and underfunding,” he told me.

Here again, the case of the 9/11 attacks is instructive.

After 9/11, the US changed a lot about how it would defend against the next major attack. The Bush administration combined 22 government agencies into a single overarching agency: the Department of Homeland Security. It also created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to better coordinate and understand the intelligence being gathered across the countries’ numerous intelligence agencies.

The 9/11 attacks also led to the rise of the surveillance state, allowing the government to track the movements of people around the world and online, even if they clearly weren’t terrorists.

The Bush administration prioritized tackling terrorism above almost any other threat in its National Security Strategy, and launched a “Global War on Terror” to confront terrorist threats around the world, which some estimates say cost more than $6 trillion.

Today, there are those who say the US government should reform once again.

“Covid-19 marks the final nail in the coffin of the ‘post-9/11 era,’ in which the United States harnessed all elements of national power to confront the scourge of violent Islamic extremism,” the first director of national intelligence, John Negroponte, and Yale’s Edward Wittenstein wrote for USA Today on Monday. “America needs a proactive intelligence agenda that draws on lessons learned from this ongoing pandemic.”

Negroponte and Wittenstein lay out four key elements of such an agenda:

Closer collaboration between intelligence agencies and the global health and scientific communities Increased focus on cybersecurity so connectivity is safeguarded for those in hospitals and working from home during an outbreak Closer monitoring of misinformation that could get people killed Increased use of artificial intelligence to help spot outbreaks before they get too big and to help physicians with diagnoses

However, it’s not like the US government doesn’t have global health security strategies on hand. It actually does, including one from the White House just last year (although it doesn’t feature the word “intelligence” once).

Other experts, like Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, say the most important change would be more money.

“There needs to be funding across the board for basic research, surveillance, modeling, and experimental work to predict pathogen emergence,” she told me. “This should include a pandemic preparedness plan and a standing committee to oversee this work.” That work would also include ensuring emergency stockpiles of medical equipment are full and ready for use, and also ensure that government agencies know their exact roles in times of crisis.

But some say that, other than a lack of preparation to have the medical capacity needed for an outbreak, the US national security community doesn’t actually need much reform.

Michael Leiter, who led the National Counterterrorism Center from 2007 to 2011, told me that the intelligence community did well predicting this kind of crisis. The fault in this case “falls entirely on the National Security Council, and hence the White House.” It’s not so much that the US needs to restructure its national security apparatus, then. The intelligence system worked, Leiter says. It’s the leaders who failed.

Others agree. “The real problem is not the intelligence community, but rather the policy side who have been warned about a pandemic multiple times,” said Mathew Burrows, a former top intelligence official who wrote the National Intelligence Council’s Global Trends reports. “The various administrations all complain that there are too many threats to track, but that’s life.”

“There is no reason — except bureaucratic inertia — that they could not redesign how they operate in light of a new threat environment,” added Burrows, who’s now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. “This is a huge US failure which goes beyond the stupidity of this administration.”",2
https://www.vox.com/,"The economy is in free fall.

About 22 million people — or more than 13 percent of the US labor force — have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks. Economists are projecting unemployment as high as 20 percent within a matter of months. Entire industries, like hotels and airlines, have all but shut down, and the rest of the economy is slowing as people stay indoors and the panic from the coronavirus shock turns into an ongoing recession.

When the economy is collapsing like this, there’s an actor who is supposed to step in: the Federal Reserve.

While Congress occasionally steps in to offer stimulus through tax and spending programs (and it has, though it can do much more), the primary duty of preventing and mitigating recessions in the US rests with the Federal Reserve, which is obligated under federal law to minimize unemployment.

The Fed hasn’t always lived up to that mandate. Despite taking extreme, at times heroic measures to rescue the economy in 2008-’09, the Fed still oversaw a prolonged, painfully slow recovery that took a decade or more to reach full employment again. It continually undershot its inflation target, even as people were suffering from mass joblessness.

To its considerable credit, today’s Fed has been taking aggressive steps to fulfill its mandate, even bigger steps than the financial crisis-era Fed did. Fed Chair Jay Powell has committed trillions of dollars of Fed purchases to combating the coronavirus downturn and making sure businesses have easy access to credit. He has brought interest rates down to zero and taken the unprecedented step of subsidizing state and local governments by buying their bonds.

But while it’s become common to argue that the Fed is “out of bullets” since it’s done so much, nothing could be further from the truth. There’s still more the Fed can and should do to end this recession. Here’s what it has done so far, and what work it can still do to ease the suffering of millions of Americans.

The Fed’s actions to date, summarized

Cut rates to zero

On March 15, the Fed announced that it would cut its target interest rate to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent, returning rates to the record lows they reached during the 2008-’09 recession and its aftermath.

The Fed funds rate (often colloquially called the “Fed rate” or even just the “interest rate,” given its economy-wide effects) is the primary mechanism through which the Fed influences the American economy. When the Fed uses its powers to lower the rate, that means borrowing is cheaper: Mortgage rates fall, APRs for credit cards fall, auto loans get cheaper, etc. This is meant to stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.

The Fed enforces this target both through expectations (it’s powerful enough that just saying “we’re lowering rates” causes banks and other actors to follow suit) and through “open market operations,” in which it buys up Treasury bonds with money it creates in a bid to make those bonds’ interest rates fall to its target range. (For more, see Matt Yglesias’s explainer.)

The March 15 action was actually the second move the Fed made on interest rates in response to coronavirus. On March 3, the board slashed rates from a 1.5 to 1.75 percent range to 1 to 1.25 percent, a half-point cut. Now that rates are down to 0 to 0.25 percent, there’s nowhere left to go except negative. The Fed hasn’t done that before, but it could; see more below.

Unlimited quantitative easing

The Fed hit the zero lower bound pretty quickly in the financial crisis of 2008-’09. Once it did, it moved from trying to manipulate short-run interest rates (like the federal funds rate) to long-run interest rates, like the interest paid on 10-year US Treasury bonds. Normally it does this through “quantitative easing” — just buying up massive quantities of bonds, in particular US government bonds and mortgage bonds from Fannie and Freddie. Historically the Fed has committed to buying a specific amount of bonds, either one time or every month or quarter. Its coronavirus response started that way, with $500 billion in government bond buys and $200 billion of mortgage bond buys.

Then on March 23, it announced that quantitative easing would be unlimited. The Fed declared that it would “purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.” It also expanded what bonds it bought to include commercial real estate, not just home mortgages.

This was a major escalation from previous QE efforts because it assured markets that the Fed would keep acting indefinitely to keep long-term rates low. Uncertainty about whether QE will abruptly end, or fall short of what’s necessary, could harm the recovery, so the Fed tried to eliminate that uncertainty entirely.

Skeptics of QE argue that it hurts savers (like pension firms) at the expense of people with debts. That’s part of the point, to help people get out from under debt incurred during the recession and to encourage people and businesses to take out more debt. But it provoked some political backlash.

Buying up corporate bonds

The same day that the Fed announced unlimited QE, it also announced the creation of a variety of programs to buy up bonds not covered by the QE program. Those include new and old corporate bonds and bonds backed by consumer debt other than mortgages (student loans, auto loans, credit card loans). It also announced it would set up a “Main Street Business Lending Program” to facilitate lending to small businesses.

These programs ensure that interest rates on these kinds of loans to individuals and businesses don’t get too high and that there’s a market to buy them. That way, banks have an incentive to keep issuing loans, knowing the Fed at least could buy them.

“Traditional logic would say that actions in the corporate bond market (which is tapped by bigger businesses) should trickle down to small businesses and consumer credit,” Yglesias explained when these moves were announced. “But today’s Fed isn’t taking chances. … All kinds of loans — federal government debt, consumer debt, corporate debt, mortgage debt, commercial real estate debt, and small business debt — are going to get help.”

Later, on April 9, the Fed announced various moves to strengthen these efforts to buy up different types of debt. It offered new loans to small businesses participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, committed to buying as much as $600 billion in loans from small businesses, and expanded the size or scope of the corporate and consumer bond purchase facilities. It also …

Buying state and local bonds

… set up a $500 billion fund to buy bonds from state governments and a few large local ones, which are seeing tax revenues collapse and are much more constrained than the federal government when it comes to spending. Buying up the bonds cheap helps stabilize the municipal bond market and makes it more affordable for states and cities to take out loans now to cover pandemic expenses.

In total, the April 9 actions added $2.3 trillion to the Fed’s purchasing efforts.

Options still on the table

Negative interest rates

The Fed has set interest rates at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent. This means it’s hit the “zero lower bound” — it can’t cut interest rates any further without going negative.

That said, it can go negative. The European Central Bank has been experimenting with modestly negative interest rates since June 2014, and the Bank of Japan has since January 2016. The Fed has never done the same, but these are not normal times.

Under a negative rate system, investors have to actually pay borrowers to take their money — that is, it would actually cost you to put money in the bank. The idea is that this would push you to spend your money instead of parking it in your account.

The ECB rate is only -0.5 percent, a very small cost to most depositors. But if rates get too negative, there’s a risk that businesses and individuals will start pulling their money from banks entirely and holding cash; if your checking account is losing, say, 5 percent of its value a year, there’s a good case for taking your money out and stuffing it under a mattress.

There are ways to get around that, though. Harvard economist Greg Mankiw has suggested that the Fed could declare all paper money with a serial number ending in “0” invalid, effective a year from now. That sets up an effective rate of negative 10 percent, so if the Fed sets a rate of, say, negative 6 percent on money still in the bank, that’s still an incredibly appealing proposition compared to getting a tenth of your cash wiped out.

Miles Kimball at the University of Colorado has proposed a similar system wherein the Fed would set up an “exchange rate” between paper and electronic money, so that when you deposit $100 in cash, less than $100 is added to your bank balance. That would similarly enable negative rates and limit the incentive to hoard cash, since it can’t be deposited and used to pay checks, credit card bills, etc., and most people have bills they can’t pay in cash.

Explicitly set government bond rates

One idea publicly floated by now-Deputy Fed Chair Richard Clarida would be to take quantitative easing a step further and commit to buying up US government bonds until rates on long-term (10- and 30-year) bonds hit an explicit target — say, 0 percent.

This would have several benefits. One, it would provide some focus for the Fed’s commitment to unlimited quantitative easing by making it clear what the goal of that measure is. The Fed is clear that it wants to lower long-term interest rates, but not what it wants to lower them to, and clarifying that in terms of government bonds could give quantitative easing more power and make it more effective in lowering those rates and making it cheaper for individuals and businesses to take out long-term loans.

Second, it would help Congress in developing their own response. Mandating that government bond rates are 0 or negative in inflation-adjusted terms would give Congress a guarantee that it can cut taxes and boost spending as much as necessary to fight the downturn, without risking runaway debt; it would be free or cheaper than free to borrow.

Target levels, not rates

Currently the Fed targets a given rate of inflation — 2 percent per year, for instance. What it tries to communicate to markets is that if inflation goes above that rate, it will take action to contain it, and conversely that if inflation falls below that rate, it will take action to increase it.

The problem has been that the Fed’s obedience to this target has been asymmetrical. Inflation has undershot the Fed’s target for well over a decade now:

The Fed not only hasn’t been able to get it much higher but also hasn’t tried to get prices of goods and services to where they would have been if the US had had steady 2 percent inflation every year from, say, 2008 to present.

Many economists have called for the Fed, in response to this failure, to adopt “level targeting” — not simply trying to hit a given rate of inflation, but trying to get consumer prices to where they ought to have been if inflation had hit the Fed’s target every single year. That means committing to aggressive action, and several years of above-trend inflation (say, 4 or 5 percent annually), to get back on track.

This suggestion is often paired with a proposal to move from targeting inflation to targeting nominal GDP — the size of the economy, not adjusting for inflation. The hope is that NGDP reflects both the rate of inflation and the underlying state of the economy, and targeting it could force the Fed to be more aggressive when economic growth is lagging and unemployment is rising. The Fed has a statutory duty to minimize both unemployment and inflation, and NGDP offers one way to do that.

Let low-income countries print dollars

One of the Fed’s less recognized policy tools is “swap lines”: defined arrangements that let other countries trade their currencies for dollars. The idea is that the dollar is a stable global reserve currency, whereas other countries’ currencies tend to be less stable, creating risk around exchange rates that can deter investment, especially in developing countries. Expanding access to credit in dollars can thus help safeguard other countries’ economies.

The Fed has long had these in operation with rich countries like the UK, Canada, and those represented by the European Central Bank, but recently expanded them to include a few emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil. Expanding to even more developing countries could help them recover.

Helicopter money, or printing money and giving it to people

Perhaps the most straightforward way for the Fed to help the economy would be to put money directly in people’s hands by printing it and mailing out checks.

It’s doubtful the Fed can do this under current statutory authority, but some in Congress have argued for giving it that authority. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) has proposed $2,000-per-month checks to adults and $1,000-per-month checks to children funded by printing money. A simpler idea would be to simply let the Fed send out checks the same way that Congress did through its recent $1,200 check initiative.

Helicopter drops have a long and distinguished history as a monetary policy idea; Ben Bernanke, for instance, has argued they have a place in the policy toolkit. The Fed has traditionally shied away because it views giving money to people as the domain of fiscal policy and thus of Congress. Congress could remove that hesitation by explicitly authorizing the Fed to drop helicopter money. The Bank of England is already doing something like this by directly funding government operations via printing money, so the Fed would be in good company.

Buy corporate stocks

The Fed has supported corporations by backstopping the corporate bond market and ensuring that short- and long-term interest rates remain low. But there are other actions it could take as well, though they would potentially require authorization from Congress.

The most straightforward option would be to buy corporate stocks, the way the Bank of Japan has done in recent years. That not only helps stabilize the stock market directly, it enables the Fed to set up a sovereign wealth fund invested in the US economy whose profits it can refund to the Treasury. That effectively provides a way to finance federal spending besides taxes and debt, which can be helpful if we need more fiscal stimulus in the future.

https://www.vox.com/,"It’s been replicating like crazy over the past few weeks, spreading from person to person, city to city, country to country.

The coronavirus, yes — but also the mutual aid meant to combat it.

By this point, many of you may have seen the Google Docs, Google Forms, and other spreadsheets circulating online with the words “mutual aid” in the title. That’s a fancy way of saying we should all help each other get through this pandemic, giving what we can to neighbors and strangers alike. In these shared documents, thousands of people are jotting down their contact information and offering to do just that.

Because the coronavirus puts older and immunocompromised people at especially high risk, it’s a good idea for them to limit their exposure by staying home as much as possible. So healthy volunteers are signing up to go buy groceries and medications and deliver straight to their doorsteps.

In just a few weeks, such a vast profusion of spreadsheets has sprung up that some organizers have created meta-spreadsheets meant to compile them in one place. One such monster list contains links to more than 140 mutual aid groups spanning many US states, plus additional links for groups in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

“It’s a beautiful flowering of mutual aid,” said Cindy Milstein, a Michigan-based organizer and author who compiled the mega-list. “It’s a way to organize, but it’s also a way for people to remember the ability of humans to be kind and empathetic and dignified. People are desperate to help each other right now.”

Mutual aid centers around the idea that we should all share with each other reciprocally and that we can help meet one another’s needs in a self-directed, grassroots way, rather than relying exclusively on top-down government solutions that may come too slowly, or fail to offer adequate support to the most vulnerable people.

For communities that already felt neglected prior to the coronavirus — especially people of color and disabled, LGBTQ, and low-income people — there may be an extra layer of fear around relying solely on the government to deliver what’s needed during this pandemic. So it makes sense that we’re seeing a wellspring of mutual aid groups devoted to meeting the needs of these particular groups, such as immunocompromised people.

The flurry of activity we’re seeing now has robust intellectual roots. Mutual aid efforts have long been a staple of left-wing organizing, often operating under the slogan “solidarity, not charity.” But the thousands of volunteers who are signing up now aren’t united by a singular ideological commitment.

Some are religious leaders who feel their faith tradition compels them to fill in the gaps until a more robust state response can make sure everyone’s needs are met. Others are anarchists who don’t believe we should be relying on hierarchical government fixes in the first place. Most are simply people who are looking around, seeing a tragedy unfolding before them, and yearning to help their fellow human beings in any way they can.

The coronavirus mutual aid groups, explained

The number of mutual aid groups has grown rapidly; some states and even some cities have several of them.

Washington, DC, for example, now has more than a dozen groups divided by neighborhood, each containing the names of dozens of people and how they can help (“Whatever it takes!” some say).

One group started up when Alli McGill, the director of care at The Table Church, tweeted on March 12, “If you are in DC and are in the at-risk￼ demographic and need errands run so you can limit exposure — will you email me?” A few days and a thousand retweets later, her message yielded a far greater response than she’d anticipated.

“Instead of getting people who need things, I got people who want to help. I got 2,500 people,” she said. “It’s actually quite beautiful. There’s some real community-driven altruism springing up in response to this crisis.”

So far, her group has delivered groceries and medications to several dozen individuals in the DC area. Volunteers often pay for the supplies at the store and then get reimbursed by the individuals, if they can afford it. If they can’t, then a church fund pays for it.

The group also offers other kinds of help, from dog-walking to spiritual support. They make wellness phone calls to check on people’s physical and mental health, or “buddy up” for regular video chats to alleviate loneliness. Volunteers are busy papering the outdoors with flyers and distributing disinfected cards to neighbors to make sure everyone knows these free services are available.

The challenges of offering mutual aid during a pandemic

Thinking about how we can help our broader community, rather than just focusing on individual risk, is definitely the right spirit to adopt. That said, we can’t let altruism overtake evidence-based precautions. Volunteers eager to help vulnerable people might be carrying the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms, so they need to remember to listen to public health experts’ guidelines.

“I think it’s a good and even an essential service, as vulnerable individuals need basic supplies and they should be protected from exposure as much as possible,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “However, there is still a risk of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission that is hard to quantify.”

Rasmussen said that both those delivering and those receiving supplies should be vigilant about washing their hands and maintaining physical distance. Volunteers should disinfect supplies before delivering them, and leave them on the doorstep rather than interacting directly with the recipients or going inside.

Mutual aid group organizers generally seem to be aware of the recommended precautions. The Table Church’s group sends out the following reminder to all volunteers who sign up to make deliveries:

It is crucial to remember that when we’re fulfilling these volunteer requests we MUST USE RIGOROUS HYGIENE PROTOCOLS. Please bring and generously use hand sanitizer, or gloves if you have them. Wash your hands regularly. Do not volunteer if you’re feeling ill. If you are picking up/delivering groceries or supplies please wipe down the bag with some sort of disinfectant like Lysol or Clorox.

“You cannot eliminate risk, but you can reduce it,” McGill said in a phone interview as she drove to a senior citizen’s house to deliver food. She added that she believes grassroots organizing is a necessity right now.

“I don’t think the local government can handle running groceries to all the people at risk,” she said. “I’m compelled by my faith to serve — to try to be the hands and feet of Jesus.”

In addition to the challenge of ensuring everyone’s safety, there’s the challenge of figuring out how to do mutual aid without reinventing the wheel. When is it more effective to look to the organizers and organizations who’ve been doing similar work in a local community long before the coronavirus came knocking?

McGill, who sends out an email with volunteer opportunities each night, has been increasingly directing volunteers to partner with established groups like the Capital Food Bank and the Department of Aging and Community Living. At this point, she said, 75 percent of her group’s volunteer efforts are working with preexisting organizations in a complementary way.

But mutual aid groups can also offer other services that such organizations may not offer. “It isn’t just sharing material things,” Milstein said. “People are sharing wisdom about how to make your own mask or how to use 3D printers to make respirators.” Some are offering to connect those who need spiritual support with those who can offer it. “It’s existential and emotional, too.”

While a traditional charity and a mutual aid group might in some cases be doing the same physical activity — say, getting food to people who need it — what distinguishes them is the framing philosophy. A traditional charity pays staff members to give support to recipients; there’s a giver and a receiver. But mutual aid is an entirely voluntary exchange among equals, and it’s careful to avoid setting up a paternalistic or hierarchical relationship between them. There isn’t a giver and a receiver, because the assumption is that every single person has something to give others.

“It’s not about ‘I’m the savior and you’re the poor person who needs help.’ It’s about how we can reciprocally help each other without profit,” Milstein said.

The ways people help each other might not be equal in kind — it’s not like each person is giving the other the same resource in the same amount — but the idea is that that’s okay because we all contribute in different ways.

In this model, the older or immunocompromised person who stays home is contributing to our community-wide effort to stop the virus. Epidemiologically, that’s totally accurate, because they’re reducing the risk that they’ll end up needing hospitalization and possibly intensive care. That frees up beds for people who do get very sick to receive the treatment they’ll need in a hospital.

During the pandemic, anything we can do to ensure the health care system doesn’t become overloaded is an act of altruism — and that includes staying home and asking others for help.

Mutual aid has a long and fascinating history

In a very basic sense, mutual aid is something we’ve been doing for millennia. The desire to help one another directly and reciprocally is a basic human impulse.

But one approach to mutual aid comes out of a specific intellectual tradition, which predates the age of Google Docs and shareable spreadsheets.

In 1902, the Russian anarcho-communist philosopher Peter Kropotkin published an essay collection titled Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. He and his book are explicitly mentioned in some of the coronavirus mutual aid spreadsheets.

In contrast to Charles Darwin, whose then-ascendant evolutionary theory emphasized competition — think “natural selection” and “survival of the fittest” — Kropotkin argued that survival is based on solidarity, or as he put it, “the close dependency of everyone’s happiness upon the happiness of all.”

When he looked at nature, he noticed profound cooperation between and among species, and argued that these conditions are what enable us to thrive. His book offers examples both from natural ecosystems and from human social life.

“In his time period, they were building the railroad, and he talked about how it makes no sense for everybody to go off and compete to build their own little track — they wouldn’t connect up!” Milstein explained. “But when we cooperate, we can all move around.”

Kropotkin’s vision led him to issue a clear prescription: “Practicing mutual aid is the surest means for giving each other and to all the greatest safety, the best guarantee of existence.”

This prescription has long shaped activism among anarchists, said Milstein, the author of Anarchism and Its Aspirations. It’s also been a mainstay in communities that have often felt abandoned or marginalized by state institutions.

For example, the Black Panthers had a mutual aid program, including a free breakfast program meant to bolster the health of undernourished black youth. The LGBTQ community and the disability community, likewise, know what it’s like to have to rely on themselves for resources — and thus are well-practiced at organizing mutual aid.

“These are the groups we should be looking to now,” Milstein said, “because they actually have decades or hundreds of years of experience of having to rely on mutual aid to take care of each other.”

Of course, this isn’t to say that all, or even many, of the groups that have formed to combat coronavirus are driven by Kropotkin’s philosophy or its intellectual lineage. (Most people signing up have probably never heard of Kropotkin.) Some people have gotten involved through their faith or church; others because of their political or ideological commitments.

At bottom, it may not even matter much. Many people just want to help, and these groups have been a great vehicle for the pandemic-induced upsurge of altruism.
