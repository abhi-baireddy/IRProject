The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, on life support ever since the Trump administration abandoned it in May 2018, may now be in its final death throes.
The agreement, known as the JCPOA, constrained Iran's nuclear programme for a set period in a largely verifiable way.
Before it was signed, there was mounting concern about Tehran's nuclear activities and every chance that Israel (or possibly Israel and the US in tandem) might attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
"Iran will continue its nuclear enrichment with no limitations and based on its technical needs," a statement said.
The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief.
