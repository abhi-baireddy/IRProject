AdvertisementTrump surprised Wilkie, then serving as acting VA secretary, during a May 18 summit on prison reform at the White House by announcing he would formally nominate him for the role.
Trump praised Wilkie for an "incredible job" steering the VA in recent months, a stretch plagued by controversy and reshuffling of its leadership.
Prior to Wilkie’s nomination, longtime White House physician Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration to lead the VA last month amid scandal over his workplace behavior.
Jacquelyn Hayes-Byrd, formerly the deputy chief of staff at the agency, will serve as VA acting chief of staff while O’Rourke serves as acting secretary and as Wilkie undergoes the confirmation process in the Senate.
