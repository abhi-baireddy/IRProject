This magazine was founded in 2002 in large part to oppose that war and the destructive, hubristic foreign policy ideas that fueled it.
Our foreign policy debates have changed somewhat since 2003, and there is much more support for foreign policy restraint now, but overall Americans have still learned remarkably little from this debacle.
If there was one lesson to learn from the invasion of Iraq, it is that preventive war is both wrong and unwise.
Preventive wars are nothing more than criminal aggression, but in the years since the invasion of Iraq preventive war has been normalized into just one more “option” to be considered.
I opposed the war from the start, but considering how preposterous the case for war was I can’t take much credit for that.
