The Treasury Department responded to Republican senators’ request for highly sensitive financial records related to Hunter Biden, according to a report, placing “’evidence’ of questionable origin” to the lawmakers.

The records requests came from Sens. Charles Grassley, Ron Johnson, and Lindsey Graham and were sent to a number of federal agencies, including the State Department, Justice Department, and the Treasury Department, among others.

“Grassley and Johnson have sought to obtain some of the most sensitive and closely held documents in all of federal law enforcement — highly confidential suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by financial institutions with FinCEN, an agency of the Treasury that helps to police money laundering,” Yahoo News reports.

And now it seems the senators are getting some answers, according to Ron Wyden's office, the ranking Democratic senator on the Finance Committee.

“Applying a blatant double standard, Trump administration agencies like the Treasury Department are rapidly complying with Senate Republican requests — no subpoenas necessary — and producing ‘evidence’ of questionable origin,” Wyden spokesperson Ashley Schapitl told Yahoo News in a statement. “The administration told House Democrats to go pound sand when their oversight authority was mandatory while voluntarily cooperating with the Senate Republicans’ sideshow at lightning speed.”

But details about that information remain to be seen, as Wyden was not more specific and Grassley refused to identify what Treasury handed over.

"It's unfortunate that Democrats whom we’ve kept in the loop on our investigations would recklessly seek to interfere with legitimate government oversight,” a Grassley spokesman told The New York Times.

On Wednesday, Grassley and Johnson said in a letter they are also looking at Hunter Biden’s “government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business.”
