A bipartisan majority in the Senate approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on Thursday, clearing the way for President Donald Trump’s signature.
The Senate voted 89 to 10 for USMCA, an updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
A day before the Senate vote, the president signed a “phase one” trade deal with China.
“This new trade deal is a modest improvement,” the senator said Tuesday.
Trumka endorsed the revised version — the first trade deal the AFL-CIO has backed since a US-Jordan deal in 2001.
