Activists calling for Virginia’s adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment gather outside the Virginia State Capitol building in Richmond, January 8, 2020.
AdvertisementThe purpose of the Equal Rights Amendment is to put seemingly innocuous language into the Constitution — declaring men and women equal before the law — that could then be used to force policy changes that the democratic process will not yield.
When Congress originally submitted the ERA to the states for ratification in 1972, it gave it a March 1979 deadline.
(It takes a two-thirds supermajority, the kind the ERA got in 1972, to submit an amendment for ratification.)
Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg has conceded that any effort to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment would have to involve starting over: getting a new supermajority of Congress and new state ratifications.
