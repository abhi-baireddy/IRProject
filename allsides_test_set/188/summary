The IRS has started to issue coronavirus rebates to tens of millions of people but faces challenges in getting the payments to everyone.

The IRS’s in-house watchdog, National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins, wrote on her organization’s website Wednesday that in 2019, only 59 percent of taxpayers received refunds via direct deposit.
The Get My Payment tool launched on Wednesday, and lawmakers reported hearing from constituents who were having problems using it.
For example, the Get My Payment tool does not allow people to change bank account information that is already on file with the IRS.
