Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow male athletes who identify as female to compete against female athletes.
Do female athletes deserve the right to compete on a level playing field?
The Connecticut Association of Schools and the state Interscholastic Athletic Conference say the transgender policy follows a state anti-discrimination law.
The lawsuit follows a Title IX complaint filed by the female athletes and their families with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.
As CBN News reported last August, the federal government announced it would investigate the allegations of discrimination filed by the three girls against Connecticut's policy regarding transgender athletes.
