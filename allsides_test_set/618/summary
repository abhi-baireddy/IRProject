In the 19th century, socialism was viewed by many as a potential alternative to the Old World’s stagnant dynastic monarchies.
This is also the case with the “democratic socialism” Sanders preaches, which turns out to be something of a misnomer.
To the socialist, “democracy” does not signify a popular right to vote or the right to choose a system of government or economy.
By the late 20th century, Sanders was still a true socialist believer.
But he is within the social-democratic tradition of their party, a tradition of regulated free markets and generous welfare states that is not at all like democratic socialism.
