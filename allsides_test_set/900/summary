Iran announced it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium in what could be the final blow to the country's 2015 nuclear deal.
According to Iranian state TV, the Iranian government said Sunday that the country would end its commitment to the unraveling 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which was negotiated by the Obama administration.
It additionally noted that it is prepared to return to compliance with the deal if the U.S. removes sanctions on the country.
While Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2018 with the goal of forcing Iran into a stricter deal, European leaders have attempted to keep constraints on Iran's nuclear program intact.
Some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern that war with Iran may be inevitable amid the escalation and Soleimani's death.
