The ceremony commemorated the 1995 slaying of Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiite Muslims.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Taliban said they were not involved in the attack, which came less than a week after the U.S. and the group signed an ambitious peace deal that lays out a path for the withdrawal of American forces from the country. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said 32 people were killed and 81 wounded in the attack in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul. The Health Ministry gave the same death toll but said 58 were wounded. All of the casualties were civilians, Rahimi said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah, who is the country’s chief executive and was a top contender in last year’s presidential election, was among several prominent political officials who attended the ceremony but left before the attack and were unhurt.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More Stories:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-91"><a class="link-0-2-92" href="/ba413629d2fa1e2d77d73fd7096ba6b4">– <!-- -->US seeks UN backing for Taliban peace deal to end Afghan war</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-91"><a class="link-0-2-92" href="/b1149fb9a2f6d2e8c811746759d9a34b">– <!-- -->International court approves Afghanistan investigation</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-91"><a class="link-0-2-92" href="/c901409b8bfe1f08e24902fb2913f0cc">– <!-- -->Pompeo: Afghan violence must ease for peace deal to advance </a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Several TV journalists were covering the ceremony inside a walled compound when the gunmen began shooting, and a reporter and a cameraman for a local broadcaster were among the wounded.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Karim Khalili, the chief of Afghanistan’s high peace council, was delivering a speech when the gunfire interrupted him. He was not hurt and later went on TV to denounce the violence.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Several witnesses said that, amid the panic, members of the security forces at the event had fired on civilians in the crowd.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“Individuals with military uniforms who were there targeted people, there were casualties, dead and wounded,” said witness Ghulam Mohammad, according to Associated Press video.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Another survivor, Noor Mohammad, said: “Everyone was running. Three casualties were on the ground in front of me. I ran out of there to save my life.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">After opening fire, the two gunmen holed up in a half-finished apartment building, leading to a five-hour standoff with security forces. They were eventually killed and security forces cleared the building, Rahimi said. The area was cordoned off by dozens of security forces.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the violence and reiterated “that attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable,” according to U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The United Nations stands with all Afghans in solidarity and remains committed to an Afghan-led peace process that will end the conflict,” Dujarric said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Kabul last year, when a suicide bomber killed 63 people and wounded 182 at a wedding. All were from the Shiite Hazara community.</p><div id="afs:Content:8608641046" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-84">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-85 overrideArticle" href="/tag/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Any U.S. troop pullout from Afghanistan would be tied in part to promises by the Taliban to fight terrorism and IS. During the withdrawal, the U.S. would retain the right to continue its counter-terrorism operations in the country.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Taliban have been fighting Islamic State militants in its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan. U.S. military officials have said IS has been degraded because of U.S. and Afghan operations but also by Taliban assaults. A U.S. Defense Department official told the AP that they worried IS was expanding its footprint into Kunar province, where the Taliban knows the terrain and could be an asset in tracking down IS.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Associated Press writer Edith M.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who witnessed the signing of that agreement in Qatar, said Thursday that the violence was not acceptable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We know that the road ahead will be difficult,\" Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. “We expected it. We were right. The upsurge in violence in parts of Afghanistan over the last couple days is unacceptable. In no uncertain terms violence must be reduced immediately for the peace process to move forward.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. officials said Wednesday's airstrike was intended as a message to the Taliban to continue to enforce a reduction in violence commitment they had agreed before their peace talks with the Afghan government that are supposed to begin next week. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials noted that the deal did not include a full cease-fire but left negotiations on a nationwide truce to the follow-up talks. It did not say that the truce or completion of a peace accord were required conditions for the withdrawal of American troops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Defense Secretary Mark Esper told senators on Wednesday that the Taliban were honoring the agreement by not attacking U.S. and coalition forces, “but not in terms of sustaining the reduction in violence.” He added: \"Keeping that group of people on board is a challenge. They've got their range of hard-liners and soft-liners and so they’re wrestling with that too, I think.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Esper said the document allowed the U.S. to act in defense of the Afghan forces. The peace deal says the U.S. must begin withdrawing more than 4,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan in the next week or so. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, a surge in Taliban attacks since the peace deal was signed, coupled with the refusal thus far of the Afghan government to release thousands of Taliban prisoners, may have imperiled the planned Tuesday start of the Afghanistan negotiations. Pompeo called on all sides to get the process moving.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We continue to press all sides to stop posturing, start a practical discussion about prisoner releases, knuckle down and prepare for the upcoming inter-Afghan negotiations,” he said. “The future of this peace process isn't just about what we do, or what the Taliban does, it's about getting the Afghan people together to solve this problem that has plagued Afghanistan for now 40 years.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that the U.S.-Taliban agreement gave away too much for too little and may threaten America's national security. They also complained about two annexes to the agreement that have not been made public that lay out the process for the withdrawal of American and allied troops\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Even Trump allies such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., have aired doubts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett said in a tweet that Wednesday's “defensive” strike was aimed at countering a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in southern Helmand province. He said Taliban forces had conducted 43 attacks on Afghan troops on Tuesday in Helmand, where the local governor's official said two police officers were killed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Afghan Interior Ministry said four civilians and 11 troops were killed Wednesday in a wave of Taliban attacks across the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In his account of the call with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban and head of their political office in Qatar, Trump told reporters that his relationship with Baradar is “very good” and that the Taliban “want to cease the violence.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House readout of the call was more restrained. It said Trump had “emphasized the need to continue the reduction in violence” and urged the Taliban to participate in the intra-Afghan talks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a tweet Wednesday, the U.S. special representative, Zalmay Khalilzad, said he had met with Baradar and other Taliban members before the call with Trump. “We all agreed the purpose of the US-Taliban agreement is to pave the path to a comprehensive peace in Afghanistan,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has looked to the agreement as a step toward making progress on his campaign pledge to extract U.S. troops from “endless wars.”\u003c/p>","pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--United States-Afghanistan","headline":"Pompeo: Afghan violence must ease for peace deal to advance ","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c901409b8bfe1f08e24902fb2913f0cc","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"c901409b8bfe1f08e24902fb2913f0cc_1a5aza0c0","notificationId":null,"hons":false,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["a53d67d78f3447258afff51c079ff407","da323444da1946ec990403dc88deb18d","1208179424904555a97b7a49690f9876","a8559df760084b87bf45bc94213a4ee2"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/a53d67d78f3447258afff51c079ff407/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a news conference at the State Department in Washington, Thursday, March, 5, 2020.
