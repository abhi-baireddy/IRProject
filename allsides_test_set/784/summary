As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, members of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force have overwhelmingly appeared on Fox News to discuss the virus, while largely shunning CNN and MSNBC.
According to Media Matters’ internal database, from the formation of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force on January 29 through March 27, task force members appeared 109 times on weekday cable news programs.
Of those 109 appearances, 82 have been on Fox News, 22 on CNN, and just five on MSNBC.
Task force officials' choice of cable outlets is unsurprising given the symbiotic relationship between the White House and Fox News.
But it’s noteworthy that they have flocked to a network which has largely failed in its coronavirus coverage by downplaying the threat, promoting unproven cures, and spreading medical misinformation about the response to the virus.
