But the common thread between the two approaches is that neither appears to have engendered the kind of fear and respect that is central to Trump’s foreign policy.
His initial approach to North Korea was similar to the current approach to Iran, with Trump promising “fire and fury” and to “totally destroy” the rogue nation if it got out of line.
Previously, North Korea seemed to be moving its nuclear program along more quietly; now it’s very much out in the open.
In Iran, Trump has responded militarily to some degree, including over the weekend by striking facilities the U.S. government says belong to an Iranian-backed militia in Syria and Iraq.
On North Korea, he didn’t have much to say.
