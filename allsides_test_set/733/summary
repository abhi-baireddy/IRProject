The theme of the conference is "Israeli Innovation for Humanity," and will feature Israeli companies in the medical, agricultural, transportation, and other fields whose products help humanity.
Calev Myers says the summit is an opportunity for Christians to confront the global anti-Israel Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
"The best way to fight BDS is by bringing more business to Israel," Myers told CBN News.
The result is millions of dollars worth of transactions that strengthen Christian businesses and the Jewish State's economy.
"I can't think of a better way to humiliate BDS than by opening up a fully-functioning global trade center in Jerusalem," said Myers.
