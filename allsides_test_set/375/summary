John Prine, who traded his job as a Chicago mail carrier to become one of the most revered singer-songwriters of the last half-century, died on Tuesday of COVID-19 complications, after surviving multiple bouts with cancer.
Poet Laureate Ted Kooser, Prine became the first singer-songwriter to read and perform at the Library of Congress.
John Prine was born Oct. 10, 1946, in Maywood, Ill., to William Prine and Verna Hamm, and picked up the guitar as a teenager, with some lessons from his brother, David.
“He said, ‘If you don’t go down to Houston, Texas, John Prine, I will come to Nashville, Tennessee, and kick your ass every mile of the way,’” Prine told Phillips biographer Peter Guralnick.
John Prine performs during a tribute to his musical contributions at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Feb. 9, 2019.
