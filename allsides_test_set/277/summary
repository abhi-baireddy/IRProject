President Trump announced on Monday a set of guidelines that he said Americans should follow to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- despite admitting that the pandemic could stretch into July or August.
Speaking during a briefing of the coronavirus task force, Trump outlined a plan to slow the spread of COVID-19 in 15 days.
“With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly,” Trump said.
"I think postponing is unnecessary.”The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 169,000 people and killed over 6,500.
But, Trump, who has been sharply criticized for underplaying the severity of the crisis, stuck to his optimistic tone about the nation's response.
