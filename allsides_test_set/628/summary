Last year, for the first time, wind overtook coal as a power source in Texas.
The renewable energy industry’s growth has been consistently outpacing forecasts.
In 2000, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicted the nation would generate 15 billion kilowatt hours of electricity from wind and solar in 2020.
The actual amount today is already 33 times that amount, with nonhydro renewables making up about 12% of total U.S. power generation.
Such circumstances would need to continue – particularly in the solar and wind industries – for renewables to beat their current projections for 2050.
