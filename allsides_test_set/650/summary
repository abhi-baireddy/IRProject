Police say Gillum, who was not arrested, was too intoxicated to answer questions.
An offense incident report says that officers found three clear plastic baggies of suspected crystal meth on the bed and floor.
Dyson told Miami New Times that he has been friends with Gillum “for a while,” but did not know anything about a wedding.
Although the contents of the bags in the hotel room have not yet been confirmed, crystal meth has made a resurgence in South Florida, particularly in Miami Beach, in recent years.
“It’s a very customer-rich environment, with all the different venues, events and parties for people to enjoy themselves,” a Miami Beach street-crimes captain told the Miami Herald in 2017.
