The Trump administration’s decision to allow the year-round sale of gasoline with a higher concentration of ethanol will give farmers more opportunities to sell corn and could lower fuel prices for consumers, according to Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler.
Ethanol is less expensive to produce than gasoline, which can potentially bring prices at the pump down for some motorists.
“Ethanol today on a wholesale basis – and this is really the good news for the consumer – is 80 cents a gallon cheaper than gasoline,” he said.
Lifting the federal ban on the summer sale of high-ethanol blends of gasoline could potentially boost corn usage in the U.S.
Pacific Ethanol shares soared 54 percent Monday in anticipation of higher ethanol sales.
