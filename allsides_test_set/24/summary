So, in 2018, Cincinnati announced its own 2035 mandate for carbon neutrality—the 100th US city to do so—by turning to solar energy.
Cincinnati planned to create the largest municipal-run solar farm in the country, and two years later, it looks like they’ve succeeded.
A former soybean farm, about 40 miles east of the city, will be the solar farm’s location.
According to Michael Forrester, the city energy manager, that should roughly equal $2.7 million in electricity costs a year for the city services.
Residential power usage demands 800 MW and that doesn’t include the need to direct another 90 MW to all of its other energy requirements.
