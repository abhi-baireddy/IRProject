The poverty line is used to determine eligibility for a wide array of government programs.
In other words, it’s essentially laying the groundwork to change how we measure poverty, with an eye toward shrinking the pool of who’s eligible for benefits.
The current poverty line is this number, calculated in 1963 and based on 1955 data, updated by the Consumer Price Index in each year since.
The Trump administration request asks for comments on the usage of all of these measures for adjusting the poverty line.
Defenders of the idea argue that what Trump’s proposing, beyond saving money, would simply make the poverty line more accurate.
