When she was the head of the Boston Public Health Commission, every single employee went through anti-racism training.
I don’t know [if] she’s naming racism yet or she’s being very clear about collecting and showing data by race/ethnicity.
The Wisconsin Public Health Association said that racism was a public health crisis and then Milwaukee County took that.
So public health people on the ground and public health leadership are so far away from the president’s frame that maybe they should get a little bit closer to actively defy that frame.
But I would have to say that public health people who stood up to the president and actively defied him might find that their public health departments or their states were punished.
