In April 2020, as the death toll in the United States from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic approached 18,000, a video supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump encouraging people to vote even if they were gravely ill started to circulate on social media:This is a genuine video of Trump saying “I don’t care if you’re sick.
[…] Get out and vote.” However, Trump made these remarks in November 2016, not during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It shows then-candidate Trump urging supporters to vote even if they just been given the “worst possible prognosis.”Trump said:You got to get out there November 8th.
I say kiddingly but I mean it: I don’t care how sick you are.
I don’t care if you just came back from the doctor, and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it’s over.
