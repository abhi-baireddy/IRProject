WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday reacted skeptically to the Trump administration’s request to continue a controversial but inactive domestic surveillance program that collects data on U.S. phone calls and text messages.
“That’ll be a tough sell if you don’t use it,” Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham said after the meeting.
“The NSA has indicated they think on balance that the phone program isn’t worth it, given their other priorities,” he told reporters.
Both the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-led House of Representatives are preparing legislation that would discontinue the NSA program, while leaving other surveillance programs intact.
Barr told Republicans on Tuesday he would change the FBI’s internal practices to minimize the possibility of abuse.
