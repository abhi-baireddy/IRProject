President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban from European countries Wednesday night to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to address the pandemic.
“The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” Trump said.
"These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval," Trump said in his televised address.
