The price of U.S. crude fell as much as 34% to $27.34 a barrel, a stunning drop for one day and the lowest price since early 2016.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The decline followed Russia’s refusal last week to join the OPEC oil cartel in proposed production cuts aimed at supporting prices. Thwarted in its search for cuts, Saudi Arabia, the leading OPEC member, sharply changed course over the weekend by cutting prices and signaling it will ramp up production.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Here is a look at the oil price war and what it could mean over the longer term in the industry as well as for consumers at the gas pump.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More Stories:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/fd1c9f9399e178c1810ba7a26f9ee467">– <!-- --> Wall Street circuit breakers trip; markets, crude plunge</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/d69d338f530492125c92424b8ae3290d">– <!-- -->Asian stocks steady after plunge on virus, oil crash</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/d66a95ec77d43fea5156aa6327fdf650">– <!-- -->Stocks, oil plunge over global fight for crude production</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___ </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Q: WHY ARE OIL PRICES FALLING? </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">A: First came the <a class="" href="/UnderstandingtheOutbreak">coronavirus outbreak</a><!-- -->, which reduced travel and transport, sharply reducing demand for fuel. The international Brent benchmark had fallen from $69 at the start of the year to around $50 last week.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Then came last week’s meeting between <a class="" href="/0e506272d853f17d0da6f126ab9f3e1c">OPEC and non-member countries</a><!-- -->. On the agenda: a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, or about 1.5% of global production. The idea was to keep prices from sagging even more as demand is expected to fall this year. Saudi Arabia, the world’s No. 2 oil producer, wanted No. 3 Russia and other nonmembers to take 500,000 barrels per day of the cuts. Since 2016, the Saudis and the Russians have worked together on production issues.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But this time the Russians balked. They refused to join new cuts, or even to extend previous production cuts that were due to expire at the end of March. And the Saudis hit back, telling customers that they were going to ramp up production and slash prices for Asian customers.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___ </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Q: WHAT IS SAUDI ARABIA’S GOAL? </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">A: First, protecting market share. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have seen U.S. producers take a chunk of their market, and falling prices help keep customers on board.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Second, Saudi Arabia may hope that the pain of low prices will force a Russian rethink. “Saudi Arabia has de facto launched a price war against Russia, promising to sell its oil at a discount in order to maximize its oil revenues,” say analysts at UniCredit bank. “It appears Saudi Arabia wants to cement its position as the world’s top oil exporter and to persuade Moscow to return to the negotiating table.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Q: WHAT’S BEHIND RUSSIA’S REFUSAL? </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">A: Russia may have seen no point in cutting production only to lose market share as U.S. shale producers in Texas and New Mexico take up the slack. Analysts say Saudi Arabia may be underestimating Russia’s ability to weather low prices. Both countries are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their state budgets. But Russia says it can balance its budget at around $42 a barrel for its own benchmark crude. Saudi Arabia, whose economy is less diverse, needs more than $80 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund, even though its costs are much lower than Russia’s. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">What Saudi Arabia has done is to send prices so low that both will feel a serious crunch. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">And Russia may have a longer-term target: the U.S. oil industry. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The Russians are doing this out of long-term strategic considerations,” said Tom Adshead, research director for the Macro-Advisory consulting firm in Moscow. “Their view is that by doing this they can damage the financial health of U.S. shale-oil producers and that by doing this they can take a lot of U.S. capacity offline and thereby remove U.S. producers as a source of competition. The other thing that is on their mind in all this is that if they cut then that will also primarily benefit U.S. producers.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“So they’ve decided they’re going to take some short-term pain in order to inflict damage on one of their major competitors,” Adshead said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp., says Russian President Vladimir Putin may also have decided to hit back at the U.S. industry after Washington placed sanctions on Russian state oil company Rosneft for marketing Venezuela’s oil. </p><div id="afs:Content:8606917046" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-91">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-92 overrideArticle" href="/tag/Financialmarkets">Financial markets</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Q: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US PRODUCERS?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">A: The current low prices could constrain activity in the American shale oil industry. A downturn in oil prices in 2014-2016 hurt companies in places like the Permian Basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, $50 per barrel is the price at which it becomes profitable to drill a new well in the U.S. Large producers such as Exxon have already scaled back with prices at $50 a barrel.

The price of U.S. crude fell as much as 34% to $27.34 a barrel, a stunning drop for one day and the lowest price since early 2016.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The decline followed Russia's refusal last week to join the OPEC oil cartel in proposed production cuts aimed at supporting prices. Thwarted in its search for cuts, Saudi Arabia, the leading OPEC member, sharply changed course over the weekend by cutting prices and signaling it will ramp up production.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Here is a look at the oil price war and what it could mean over the longer term in the industry as well as for consumers at the gas pump.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"4abe3480-43d0-11ea-c11f-514b11a5067e\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Q: WHY ARE OIL PRICES FALLING? \u003c/p>\u003cp>A: First came the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">coronavirus outbreak\u003c/a>, which reduced travel and transport, sharply reducing demand for fuel. The international Brent benchmark had fallen from $69 at the start of the year to around $50 last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then came last week's meeting between \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/0e506272d853f17d0da6f126ab9f3e1c\">OPEC and non-member countries\u003c/a>. On the agenda: a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, or about 1.5% of global production. The idea was to keep prices from sagging even more as demand is expected to fall this year. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil producer, wanted No. 3 Russia and other nonmembers to take 500,000 barrels per day of the cuts. Since 2016, the Saudis and the Russians have worked together on production issues.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But this time the Russians balked. They refused to join new cuts, or even to extend previous production cuts that were due to expire at the end of March. And the Saudis hit back, telling customers that they were going to ramp up production and slash prices for Asian customers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Q: WHAT IS SAUDI ARABIA'S GOAL? \u003c/p>\u003cp>A: First, protecting market share. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have seen U.S. producers take a chunk of their market, and falling prices help keep customers on board.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Second, Saudi Arabia may hope that the pain of low prices will force a Russian rethink. “Saudi Arabia has de facto launched a price war against Russia, promising to sell its oil at a discount in order to maximize its oil revenues,” say analysts at UniCredit bank. “It appears Saudi Arabia wants to cement its position as the world’s top oil exporter and to persuade Moscow to return to the negotiating table.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Q: WHAT'S BEHIND RUSSIA'S REFUSAL? \u003c/p>\u003cp>A: Russia may have seen no point in cutting production only to lose market share as U.S. shale producers in Texas and New Mexico take up the slack. Analysts say Saudi Arabia may be underestimating Russia's ability to weather low prices. Both countries are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their state budgets. But Russia says it can balance its budget at around $42 a barrel for its own benchmark crude. Saudi Arabia, whose economy is less diverse, needs more than $80 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund, even though its costs are much lower than Russia's. \u003c/p>\u003cp>What Saudi Arabia has done is to send prices so low that both will feel a serious crunch. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And Russia may have a longer-term target: the U.S. oil industry. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Russians are doing this out of long-term strategic considerations,\" said Tom Adshead, research director for the Macro-Advisory consulting firm in Moscow. “Their view is that by doing this they can damage the financial health of U.S. shale-oil producers and that by doing this they can take a lot of U.S. capacity offline and thereby remove U.S. producers as a source of competition. The other thing that is on their mind in all this is that if they cut then that will also primarily benefit U.S. producers.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"So they’ve decided they’re going to take some short-term pain in order to inflict damage on one of their major competitors,” Adshead said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp., says Russian President Vladimir Putin may also have decided to hit back at the U.S. industry after Washington placed sanctions on Russian state oil company Rosneft for marketing Venezuela's oil. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8606917046\">Full Coverage: Financial markets\u003c/div>\u003cp>Q: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US PRODUCERS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>A: The current low prices could constrain activity in the American shale oil industry. A downturn in oil prices in 2014-2016 hurt companies in places like the Permian Basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, $50 per barrel is the price at which it becomes profitable to drill a new well in the U.S. Large producers such as Exxon have already scaled back with prices at $50 a barrel. In Texas, the number of active rigs fell from 553 in October 2018 to 398 in January 2020. Around the same time, the oil industry in Texas shed about 14,000 jobs\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With the growth phase of the shale boom grinding to a halt due to the lack of investment in the industry, now U.S. shale oil could find itself running into a brick wall,” says Innes from AxiCorp.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, believes the U.S. shale industry will survive but the risks are high. He warned countries against being rash with big production decisions: “This is not a Russian roulette.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Q: WHAT'S IT MEAN FOR PRICES AT THE PUMP? \u003c/p>\u003cp>A: Most of the price of gasoline in the United States simply reflects the price of oil, so lower crude prices should mean lower pump prices with a lag of about six weeks.

The price of U.S. crude fell as much as 34% to $27.34 a barrel, the lowest price since early 2016, as an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia broke out. Typically, falling energy prices are good for markets and for businesses. However, in times of economic duress, energy prices come to be seen as a barometer of the global economy overall. That appeared to be what happened Monday with crude prices suffering the largest single-day decline since the 1991 Gulf War. Here are some of the developments that are affecting businesses and potentially, the economy as a whole. \u003c/p>\u003cp>MARKET MESS: Stock prices tumbled so sharply at the opening bell a circuit breaker meant to slow down panic trading was triggered, halting all activity for 15 minutes. That appeared to work as intended, but the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all ended the day with losses of more than 7%. Treasury bonds continue to grow more expensive with so many investors looking for a safe place to park their money. The 30-year Treasury yield fell to all-time lows below 1%. The 10-year Treasury, which fell below 1% last week, is plumbed new depths Monday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>ENERGY DRAIN: A clash between Saudi Arabia and Russia is sending shock waves through energy markets, with wide-ranging implications for consumers, industries, and of course, big oil companies. Energy companies had already been pulling back on spending with clear signs of slowing global economic growth. Investors dumped shares of some of the biggest producers in the world. On Monday, stock in Marathon Oil plunged 47%. Occidental Petroleum slumped 52%. The winners, at least at the pump, will be consumers, though no one knows when gasoline prices will fall. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Diamondback Energy on Monday said it would reduce the number of well activation crews by a third. It also expects to drop two drilling rigs next month and a third later in the second quarter. Parsley Energy is cutting back, too. Energy analysts at Stifel downgraded a dozen companies in the sector, citing the clash between Saudi Arabia and Russia. \u003c/p>\u003cp>NO OCEAN CRUISE: Since a ship was quarantined for two weeks off of Yokohama, Japan, few sectors have been harder hit by the virus than the cruise industry. It got worse over the weekend. The U.S. State Department has issued an advisory against travel on cruise ships, particularly for travelers with underlying health conditions. Separately, the CDC noted an “increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment.” On Monday, shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 25%, shares of Norwegian Cruise Line fell 25% to an all-time low. Carnival fell 20%. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Grand Princess, meanwhile, pulled into the Port of Oakland with more than 3,500 people aboard — 21 confirmed to be infected with the new virus. The Regal Princess cruise ship was finally allowed to pull into a Florida port and passengers began disembarking after two crew members tested negative for coronavirus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>DODGING LODGING: Another sector within the hospitality industry, hotels, have been heavily damaged by the spread of the virus. With companies canceling or postponing business travel and conventions, and airlines suspending flights, room cancellations, or rooms never booked, are soaring. Analysts with Raymond James said Monday that most investors have been “overly optimistic” about the impact on hotels. Shares in Hyatt Hotels fell almost 8% Monday. Hilton fell more than 4%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>MALLED: The spread of the virus is hitting closer to home with the majority of states now reporting cases of COVID-19. That will affect the behavior of millions of people in public, including trips to the mall. On Monday, shares of mall operators sild. Simon Property Group lost 13.4%, Macerich shed 15% and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers gave back almost 14%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BANKS SHOT: Banks took a body blow last week when the U.S. Fed made a surprise cut to benchmark interest rates to protect the economy. Banks rely on interest payments from loans to generate capital, and they've already been operating in an extraordinarily low rate environment. On Monday, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist, Ellen Zentner, said she now expects the Federal Reserve to follow its 50 basis point intermeeting rate cut with another 50 basis point interest rate cut in March, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.50-0.75%. Zentner also expects the March rate cut will be followed by a 25 basis point rate cut at the April meeting, bringing the fed funds rate into a 0.25-0.50% target range. JP Morgan Chase tumbled 13.6%, while Bank of America lost 14.7% and Citi fell around 16%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Regional banks were hit even harder, some because they have heavily funded the energy industry. Regions Financial, Citizens Financial and Comerica fell about 19%\u003c/p>\u003cp>STAY HOME: More companies are telling employees to work from home, if possible. On Monday, IBM said it sent a note to all of its employees who live or work in New York City and Westchester, encouraging them to work from home if their job permits, until further notice. \u003c/p>","pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus-Outbreak-Business-Fallout","headline":" Wall Street circuit breakers trip; markets, crude plunge","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fd1c9f9399e178c1810ba7a26f9ee467","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"fd1c9f9399e178c1810ba7a26f9ee467_4a48aza0c0","notificationId":null,"hons":false,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:fd1c9f9399e178c1810ba7a26f9ee467","revision":null,"mediumIds":["dfaba3b448004a1fab2be672e7cb26a2","09c09e9096b24165a8cdbec640161d25","7e8d3ab876094f0d8079956a7650a591","8184c262e95b4dde928b03020233167f","cfb8d371e1bd44e2bbbddf1e9a35f942","5363a722dd284b2dabec06d90c68c46e"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/dfaba3b448004a1fab2be672e7cb26a2/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Empty chairs and tables are lined up outside a restaurant in St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, Monday, March 9, 2020.
