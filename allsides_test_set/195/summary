In its latest pro-abortion litigation effort, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children.
The lawsuit also contends that the cities' ordinances have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," which keeps them from clearing up confusion and assisting people with aborting their unborn children.
"As a result of being designated criminal, Plaintiffs are prohibited from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities," the lawsuit contends.
"These ordinances are unconstitutional," said ACLU of Texas staff attorney Anjali Salvador in a statement.
Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, has been a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement in the Lone Star State for months now.
