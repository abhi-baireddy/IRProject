Never-before-seen video released by the National Institutes of Health over the weekend depicts the psychological primate experiments the federal health agency has been conducting with taxpayer funding for decades.
Sixty of them will be purchased new, while the remaining primates were obtained through the NIH Nonhuman Primate Recycling Program, which transfers the animals from other experiments rather than retire them.
"PETA is calling on NIH to shut down this horrific laboratory and retire the surviving monkeys to sanctuaries."
In addition to taking a long period of time to release records and videos sought via Freedom of Information Act requests, the NIH also has a history of violating spending transparency laws at all seven taxpayer-funded National Primate Research Centers across the country.
Federal spending legislation signed into law by President Trump last year aimed to curb animal research and directed the agency to provide Congress with a report on efforts to reduce intramural primate experiments.
