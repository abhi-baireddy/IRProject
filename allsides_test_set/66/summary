But Durham's focus on the actions taken by specific individuals makes his mission look like it could transform into a criminal investigation.
Brennan, a strident Trump critic, told NBC News that Durham wants to interview him and Clapper as Durham looks into the intelligence community's actions as it examined possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.
Durham also asked about Strzok both writing and signing the documentation which launched the FBI's Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 and launching the investigation over a weekend, an unusual series of actions.
Durham has not yet interviewed Strzok, McCabe, former FBI Director James Comey, or former FBI general counsel James Baker.
DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the department was exploring the extent to which “a number of countries” played a role in the Trump-Russia investigation, and Barr and Durham reached out to the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia.
