Now Congress is discussing a fourth bill â€” "CARES 2" as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali.)
This is good news: As gargantuan as the third phase was, it's already proving itself to be grossly inadequate.
The Democratic Party leadership apparently backed off the idea of an infrastructure push once the scale of the economic catastrophe became apparent.
It's great that we may be able to pass another big aid package with relatively little partisan rancor.
And the only leverage that House Democrats have here is their willingness to hold up the fourth aid package until the GOP caves on these more politically touchy questions.
