Harry's other wealth comes from his estimated Â£20million inheritance from his mother Princess Diana. He also banked around Â£7million from his great-grandmother the Queen Mother, who paid it into a trust fund in 1994.<span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">Â </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan's net worth of around Â£4million came from having earned around Â£37,000 per episode as an actress in the US drama Suits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Playing paralegal Rachel Zane, she starred in over 100 episodes, which put her annual pay at an estimated Â£333,000. She also appeared in several films, including romantic comedies and Horrible Bosses, where she had a 30-second cameo as a delivery girl.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her role in the 2010 film Remember Me reportedly earned her Â£140,000, while she was paid Â£130,0000 for The Candidate in the same year. By keeping their royal titles â and given their high profiles on both sides of the Atlantic â Harry and Meghan are likely to be offered many lucrative engagements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The world's top speakers can command up to half a million dollars (Â£380,000) for a single after-dinner speech. They may also be able to make money from merchandise. In the past few weeks, the couple have trademarked their Sussex royal brand on more than 100 items, from T-shirts, books and magazines to teaching materials and emotional support groups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They submitted trademark applications for textbooks, footwear, headgear, coats, jackets â and even pyjamas. The couple have already managed to amass fortunes, estimated at Â£30million for Harry, and Â£4million for Meghan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the road ahead is fraught with danger if past royal commercial ventures are anything to go by. Images of the Duchess of York infamously counting bundles of cash in a News of the World sting were hard to shake off. Prince Edward once tried to combine royal duties with running a television production company, before it flopped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And his wife Sophie Wessex was also caught by the News of the World uttering indiscretions when touting herself as a PR consultant. The costs of Harry and Meghan's lifestyle are high and likely to rise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They employ a private secretary, who can earn up to Â£146,000, and a nanny for their son Archie who would also command a six-figure salary.

The Sovereign Grant is also used to pay for Harry and Meghan's official royal travel, and their website said they 'proudly' carry out official overseas visits in support of the Queen, suggesting they will still continue to do so - and claim those costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last financial year they claimed Â£130,000 for travel costs, including Â£80,000 for their trip to Australia, New Zealand and Pacific islands such as Tonga and Fiji.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This public money, known as the Sovereign Grant, was valued at Â£82.2million this year, and is comprised of profits from the Queen's property portfolio - the Crown Estate - which are paid to the Government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Twenty-five per cent of these profits are paid to the monarchy to fund the upkeep of its property, travel, security and staff.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the Sovereign Grant isn't taxpayer money, it is considered to be public funds, belonging to the state.Â </p> </div> </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry and Meghan have only recently returned from their six-week break spent in the Canadian province of British Columbia with their eight-month-old son <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/archie-harrison-mountbatten-windsor/index.html">Archie</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their first royal engagement of the new decade was to visit Canada's High Commission in central <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/london/index.html">London</a> to thank Canadians in person for the warmth of the welcome they received.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is likely they will be spending their time in the Commonwealth country when not in UK and may travel to America, Meghan's homeland and where her mother lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any move to Canada, even for a period of the year, would throw up important questions about Meghan and Harry's long-term future within the royal family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan, a former actress, lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and the couple were famously pictured together when Meghan joined her then-boyfriend Harry at the 2017 Invictus Games in the city.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cost of security for the couple would also be an issue, and as Canada is a realm, a country where the Queen is head of state, it may have to pay for keeping the couple and their son Archie safe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple's aim to be 'financially independent' may point towards them seeking a job, or a paid role with an organisation whose aims compliment their own beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other members of the monarchy who have salaried jobs include the Queen's grandchildren Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and Peter Phillips, who all work for a living.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the lows included rows over privacy, rifts with relatives, the launch of legal action and an attack on the press which overshadowed an official royal tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the Queen in her <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/article-7823271/Ones-bumpy-year-Queen-uses-Christmas-message-address-year-personal-turmoil-Royals.html">Christmas Day address</a> spoke of the 'bumpy' path her family and the nation had experienced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry and Meghan's statement announcing their decision soon after their return from a six-week break in Canada refers to their 'many months of reflection and internal discussions'.Â </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-04f3f7d0-32ad-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7866007/Harry-Meghan-step-senior-royals-financially-independent.html"> <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Harry and Meghan's Royal romance: From a star-studded wedding and the birth of Archie to a 'rift' with Prince William and controversy over their bid to 'modernise' the monarchy</h3> <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-bold"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_harry/index.html" id="mol-07957db0-32ad-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d">Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle have announced they will be stepping back as senior royals -

epic multi-tweet slap-down said the couple had committed 'spiteful treachery' and 'breaking up the Royal Family after fleecing the public purse'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Piers, who has had a long-running feud with Meghan since he accused the former Suits actress of 'ghosting' him, also referenced a quote attributed to Harry after the Duke reportedly told Kensington Palace staff 'what Meghan wants, Meghan gets' as they prepared to move out in 2018.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The broadcaster has often blasted the couple for hypocrisy, especially after they banged the drum for environmentalism while taking gas-guzzling private planes. And he doubled down on these accusations after Meghan refused to be photographed at Wimbledon despite using millions of public money to renovate Frogmore Cottage.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Royals have also waged war on the British press, which Canadian journalist Meghan Murphy said had 'bullied' Meghan in a campaign which was 'painful to watch'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Piers hit back on Twitter: 'Oh pur-lease. What's been 'painful to watch' has been their absurd woke hypocrisy &amp; constant whining. All on our dime.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Piers has also expressed sympathies with Thomas Markle, with whom Meghan has severed ties following a row over him speaking to the press about his daughter. And the commentator said the Duchess had sowed division between Harry and Prince William, amid rumours of a rift between the brothers.Â <span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple's move follows weeks of speculation about their future after they took an extended break from royal duties over the festive period that followed an emotional appearance in a documentary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the ITV programme they spoke about the pressures they have been facing and family rifts, and in a separate move Harry issued a damning statement against the media accusing sections of the press of bullying his wife.Â  This evening's announcement came afterÂ <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_harry/index.html" id="mol-00e51792-32b3-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d" class="class">Harry</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/tvshowbiz/meghan-markle/index.html" id="mol-00e51793-32b3-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d" class="class">Meghan</a>'s rumoured relocation to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-00e51794-32b3-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d">Canada</a>Â this afternoon sparked speculation that they could be about to withdraw from public life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Â </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until now Harry and Meghan have been 'prohibited from earning any income in any form' â as they pointed out last night in a lengthy statement on their official website.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple issued a declaration that they were looking forward to 'becoming financially independent'.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They said they had 'made the choice' to 'no longer receive funding' from the Sovereign Grant, adding: 'Their Royal Highnesses prefer to release this financial tie.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one knows how much the grant is worth to Harry and Meghan but in forfeiting it they have effectively liberated themselves from most accountability to taxpayers over their spending.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defending their new status, they stressed: 'There is precedent for this structure and it applies to other current members of the Royal Family who support the monarch and also have full-time jobs external to their commitment to the monarchy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the statement on the couple's website makes great play of the fact they are giving up the money from the Sovereign Grant, it does not say whether they will be making do without the cash they get from Prince Charles via his private Â£1.2billion Duchy of Cornwall estate â which some argue should be regarded as a public asset.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Charles paid Â£4.9million to his sons from his duchy income last year, of which slightly less than half is believed to have gone to Harry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday the Sussexes said the money from Charles amounted to 95 per cent of their office expenditure. They added: 'The remaining 5 per cent of funding for the Office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, covering costs associated with employing members of their official office, is received through the Sovereign Grant.'Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple stressed that 'wherever possible and unless advised otherwise on security grounds', they travel using 'commercial carriers, local trains and fuel-efficient vehicles'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry's other wealth comes from his estimated Â£20million inheritance from his mother Princess Diana.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also banked around Â£7million from his great-grandmother the Queen Mother, who paid it into a trust fund in 1994.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan's net worth of around Â£4million came from having earned around Â£37,000 per episode as an actress in the US drama Suits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Playing paralegal Rachel Zane, she starred in over 100 episodes, which put her annual pay at an estimated Â£333,000.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also appeared in several films, including romantic comedies and Horrible Bosses, where she had a 30-second cameo as a delivery girl.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her role in the 2010 film Remember Me reportedly earned her Â£140,000, while she was paid Â£130,000 for The Candidate in the same year.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By keeping their royal titles â and given their high profiles on both sides of the Atlantic â Harry and Meghan are likely to be offered many lucrative engagements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The world's top speakers can command up to half a million dollars (Â£380,000) for a single after-dinner speech.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They may also be able to make money from merchandise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past few weeks, the couple have trademarked their Sussex royal brand on more than 100 items, from T-shirts, books and magazines to teaching materials and emotional support groups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They submitted trademark applications for textbooks, footwear, headgear, coats, jackets â and even pyjamas. The couple are already hugely wealthy.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before marrying Harry, Meghan earned Â£61,000 a year running her lifestyle blog The Tig, which focused on food, travel, fashion and health and made the most of her celebrity endorsement deals.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had to shut it down when she announced she was Harry's girlfriend.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it is now reactivated, it could make her far more money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the road ahead is fraught with danger if past royal commercial ventures are anything to go by.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Images of the Duchess of York infamously counting bundles of cash in a News of the World sting were hard to shake off.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prince Edward once tried to combine royal duties with running a television production company, before it flopped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And his wife Sophie Wessex was also caught by the News of the World uttering indiscretions when touting herself as a PR consultant.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The costs of Harry and Meghan's lifestyle are high and likely to rise.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They employ a private secretary, who can earn up to Â£146,000, and a nanny for their son Archie who would also command a six-figure salary.Â </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">London 'supernannies' who work for the capital's richest and most powerful families earn an average of Â£104,000, according to industry sources.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Frogmore Cottage in Windsor they have a housekeeper â but no chef because Meghan loves cooking â two personal assistants and two palace orderlies probably earning between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000 each.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple came under scrutiny in 2019 for their use of private jets when they travelled together. The trips were privately funded by the couple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also visited family friend Sir Elton John's holiday home, but the musician revealed he had paid for the cost of the flight himself and donated to a carbon- offsetting charity.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-84e5b8c0-32ad-11ea-9951-8b5115ce248d"

Harry and Meghan were not just a couple who wanted to embrace both modernity and tradition; they were bent on re-writing the rule book of what being a member of the Royal Family actually means.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should perhaps have realised; after all, the manner in which the duchess's father was ruthlessly excluded from the ceremony went beyond mere discourtesy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, the failure of Thomas Markle to give his daughter away was blamed squarely on his own foolishness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor was much made of the absence of many of Harry's oldest friends, the mates who had stuck by him through thick and thin. In their place came a new set of chums, megawatt celebrities who had not been around when he was at his lowest ebb, but who would add a glamorous touch of stardust to proceedings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tragedy of Harry and Meghan is that they could have been life-long royal heroes. The Prince himself was already much loved, second only to the Queen in popularity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From seeing action on the front line in Afghanistan not once but twice, and from which he had emerged unscathed, Harry had won over those sceptical about his party prince reputation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the Army, affection for him soared following his triumphant visit to the Caribbean, where he posed with another superstar, the Olympic athlete Usain Bolt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If elder brother William represented the dutiful if dull side of royalty, Harry was the fun side. He was open and amusing, taking everything in his stride. All he needed was to find the love of a good woman and his happiness â and ours â would be complete.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His romantic path had been strewn if not with broken hearts then certainly with trepidation. Before Meghan, he had wooed and lost two other beauties â Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas âwho valued a life out of the limelight, rather than marriage and the goldfish bowl of royal attention.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatXWHalfRHS" style="style"> <div class="mol-img"> <div class="image-wrap"> <img id="i-d0ef8c1bbaa23e95" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23170094-7866007-Pictured_Meghan_and_Harry_in_South_Africa_last_year-a-77_1581587583567.jpg" height="690" width="470" alt="Pictured: Meghan and Harry in South Africa last year" class="blkBorder img-share" style="max-width:100%" /> </div> <noscript> <img id="i-d0ef8c1bbaa23e95" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23170094-7866007-Pictured_Meghan_and_Harry_in_South_Africa_last_year-a-77_1581587583567.jpg" height="690" width="470" alt="Pictured: Meghan and Harry in South Africa last year" class="blkBorder img-share" /> </noscript> </div> <p class="imageCaption">Pictured: Meghan and Harry in South Africa last year</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Meghan he found a soulmate who had at least experienced life in the spotlight. This, they both hoped, would provide an understanding for their future together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if anything this understanding has served to drive them apart from the very institution they say they want to support. It has led to William and Harry, once the closest of brothers, being alienated from one another, and to a series of ill-judged interventions that have provoked bafflement and, yes, even resentment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their preaching to ordinary people about how they should lead their lives â particularly about climate change â and what has come to be seen as a drip, drip, drip of complaints about how they are treated, has led to a real disconnect. Who would have thought that in recent times the mere mention of Harry and Meghan's names at Buckingham Palace would lead some of the Queen's most loyal courtiers to wrinkle their noses and pull a face.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rot set in even before the glow of that May wedding day had passed. Shortly after returning from honeymoon, Meghan was asked by a younger member of the family how it had gone and, more to the point, where they had gone. 'We're not telling anyone,' the new Duchess of Sussex smiled. Was this merely a symptom of someone still adjusting to royal life, or someone who was not about to make any compromises about their privacy?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not long before the Markle debacle over Meghan's father was again rearing its head. A sweet but naÃ¯ve figure, Thomas Markle did not help himself with his sudden fascination for giving interviews about his famous daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But here was a man of limited resources suddenly thrust onto a global stage, unsure of protocol and stumbling from one misadventure to another.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news halfRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-07d76220-3280-11ea-93c2-e98aacf49af2" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7866007/Harry-Meghan-step-senior-royals-financially-independent.html"> <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Harry and Meghan's bitter parting blast at British mediaÂ </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">By Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent for the Daily MailÂ </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry and Meghan last night aimed another blast at the British media and what they call its 'misreporting'. They announced they would be withdrawing from the 'royal rota' system, which allows British newspaper, television and radio organisations to cover their work in recognition of the monarchy being a publicly-funded organisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK media are currently entitled to cover their engagements in an impartial manner without control from royal officials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple say they now intend to offer access to specially-invited media and dispense news via their own official communications and social media channels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On their new website, sussexroyal.com, the duke and duchess said they believe this policy will reflect 'both their forthcoming independence as members of the Royal Family' and their wish to 'reshape and broaden access to their work'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also attacked the British media's body of royal correspondents, claiming: 'Regrettably, stories that may have been filed accurately by royal correspondents are also often edited or rewritten by media editorial teams to present false impressions.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry and Meghan cited their work with publications such as Time Magazine, National Geographic and British Vogue as examples of how they still believe in a 'free, strong and open media industry'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They added: 'Their Royal Highnesses recognise that their roles as members of the Royal Family are subject to interest, and they welcome accurate and honest media reporting, as well as being held to account if appropriate. Equally, like every member of society, they also value privacy as individuals and as a family.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple also said they hoped their decision to release photographs and information on their own social media would prevent publications from 'profiting' from their family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not the first time that the duke and duchess have hit out at the British media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In October last year, while they were on a royal tour of southern Africa, Harry attacked newspaper stories about him and his wife. The prince said: 'Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences â a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Referring to Press coverage of his mother, Princess Diana, before her 1997 death in a Paris car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, the duke said his 'deepest fear is history repeating itself'. He wrote: 'I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.'Â </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sympathy, at first, was with his daughter, but questions were soon asked about her and Harry's duty of care towards him. In fact, the seeds of this family fall-out which, I believe, has shaped the way Harry and Meghan are now, were sown through their own casual ineptness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should never have allowed Markle to fall into the clutches of the paparazzi with his admittedly crass stunted pictures before the wedding. Why did no one from Harry's office â or indeed Prince Charles's â fly to Mexico, where the retired lighting director lived in genteel if reduced circumstances?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He should have been flown to Britain, housed in any number of royal residences, dressed and presented to the world on his daughter's wedding day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This lack of care inevitably led to another unseemly domestic outcome â the behaviour of Meghan's extended family. As unattractive as they undoubtedly were, there was no doubt they had a point when they railed about the duchess's treatment of her divorced father. Certainly it compared unfavourably with the kidgloves handling of Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, who played a prominent part in her daughter's wedding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even so, many were prepared to cut Meghan some slack, pointing out how hard many young women â particularly Harry's mother, Diana, had found royal life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But revelations about the duchess's apparently high-handed manner were causing unease. It emerged that there had been a row between Harry and one of the Queen's closest aides over the tiara the duchess wanted to wear at her wedding. Several tiaras had been considered, but the Queen did not want to lend the one Meghan preferred. Words were exchanged and Harry backed down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, it emerged that Meghan had complained about the mustiness of St George's chapel and wanted it sprayed with air freshener before the ceremony. This was a young woman who was clearly not going to accept her position quietly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was further trouble over the bridesmaids' dresses, which was an early sign of the great tensions to come. It was reported that Meghan had reduced Kate, her soon-to-be sister-in-law, to tears, because of her manner. Weddings, of course, often lead to domestic tensions but are usually forgotten afterwards. With Harry and Meghan, they just increased.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan's decision to hold an extravagant baby shower in New York didn't just shock people, it offended them, too. What possible justification could there be for the private jets â no matter who picked up the bill â as well as luxury hotels, lavish parties and expensive baby gifts?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the kind of look associated with the Kardashians, not the Windsors. Then came the biggest shock of all â the secrecy over the birth of baby Archie. Here, not just tradition but common sense was upended. They announced there would be no bulletins on when or where the baby would be born, no traditional photograph and they even declined to say who was in charge of delivery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This didn't just upset royal fans but the Royal Family, too. For generations, the births of those close to the throne have been proclaimed on a notice placed just inside the railings of Buckingham Palace. It always includes the names of the doctors in attendance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry and Meghan simply ignored protocol and did it their way. While touching it undoubtedly was as Harry spoke of his pride and joy, the moment was riven with controversy. As for the birth, they cackhandedly arranged for a statement saying Meghan had gone into labour to be issued after the baby had actually been born.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the real insult came when baby Archie's christening was shrouded in secrecy. The couple refused to say who the godparents were, and when photographs did appear the infant's face was largely obscured.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some may see this as unnecessary carping about a couple who want to ensure their son is not brought up in the royal way, but has the privacy that was denied Harry and William as they grew up. Others suggest that all they were really doing was weaponising their family in their battles for privacy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the 'fab four', as the royal brothers and their wives had been dubbed, was no more. Harry and Meghan moved to Windsor, separated his office from William's and split from their highly successful charity, the Royal Foundation .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was not just a change in direction but a unilateral declaration of independence. Nothing illustrated this more than their decision to give an interview to ITV while on a royal tour of southern Africa last autumn. It was a mistake of historic proportions. Standing against a backdrop of some of the most deprived regions on earth, they complained to the camera about their lot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time Harry's comments triggered another wave of disbelief. Questioned about his relationship with William he confirmed what until then had been mere tittle tattle: that the once whisper-close brothers had fallen out. How much this domestic heartache is at the centre of the Sussexes's bombshell is not yet clear. But the repercussion are going to echo for a long time to come.Â </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak">Â </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Immune to their privilege.

For months now, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had the look of two people who would rather suck lemons than continue to be an active part of the Royal Family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, it's a surprise they've lasted this long. That said, I'm very sad to see them go. And so soon. It feels like they've barely got stuck in, hardly had a chance to understand what the job really entails before handing in their resignation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's almost as though they never really had any intention of trying to stick it out at all, as though right from the start the notion was always there in the back of their minds that if life as Duke and Duchess didn't live up to expectation, they would simply leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being a part of the Royal Family is not easy. It may carry all the trappings of privilege, but there is a hefty price to pay. It takes determination and a deep-rooted sense of duty to withstand both the scrutiny and expectations of the British public and press. A strong backbone and a thick skin are just as vital as an elegant wave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Successive generations of royals have had to learn these lessons in their own way. None â not even the Queen â have been immune to the pressures that come with such a rarefied existence. The personal sacrifices that have to be made can be hard to bear, all the more so because they have to be borne in private.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet, for those who endure, the rewards are great. Not just the undying love and respect of the British people, but also a chance to pursue one's passions and really make a difference where it matters. Both Prince Charles and Prince William have battled their own demons, and risen finally to the challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which is why it's all the more unsettling to see Harry â once the rumbustious soldier, never afraid of getting stuck in among the lads â flying the white flag so early on in the struggle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I suppose there is a kind of courage in knowing when you've had enough, and in that respect Harry has been clear. But, in truth, it's not entirely obvious what has driven him to such a conclusion: was the Â£2.4million taxpayer-funded refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage not lavish enough? The outpouring of affection at their multi-million-pound wedding insufficiently fawning? The Queen's repeated invitations to stay â rebuffed more than once â not hospitable enough?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's almost as though nothing matters to this couple apart from their own immediate happiness and gratification, as though they are incapable of seeing beyond their own little bubble of privilege.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news halfRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-7884c360-3284-11ea-93c2-e98aacf49af2" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7866007/Harry-Meghan-step-senior-royals-financially-independent.html"> <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Canadians say they'll welcome Harry and Meghan with open arms as long as they don't have to pay for their securityÂ </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">By Emily Crane for DailyMail.com</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Canadians say they will welcome Prince Harry and wife Meghan with open arms should they choose to relocate to Canada after quitting the Royal Family - as long as they don't have to pay their security costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has remained unusually silent following Harry and Meghan's announcement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every day Canadians were overwhelmingly supportive about the country potentially becoming Harry and Meghan's new home - as long as they didn't have to fork out the costs for their tight security.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As long as we Canadians do not have to pay for Meghan and Harry's security costs, I don't really care about the rest,' one person tweeted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another tweeted: 'My hope is that Meghan and Harry decided to go the 'no drama' route of raising their child in a more peaceful, less-public environment.

Canada is waiting with open arms to welcome you back,' another tweet said, referring to President Trump.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Certainly we here in Canada will welcome them as we always have.'</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has often been speculated as to whether they might end up walking away from Britain, but the timing of this announcement could hardly be more insensitive, or more indicative of how little either seems to understand the true nature of their roles as Royals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prince Philip has only just come out of hospital. The Yorks are still weathering a storm of scandal. In the wider world, Britain's forces stand in peril in the Middle East. Yet this is the moment they choose to walk away â and without telling the Queen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet for all that, my reaction to this story is more sadness than anger. Especially when you think back to how happy we all were when Harry finally found his bride, how excited we were to share in his delight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That little lost boy deprived of his mother had had it rough, not helped by the pain that a bitter parental divorce can bring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All those years of drunken escapades, Nazi uniforms, strip billiards in Vegas, fleeting Sloaney girlfriends â they all melted away when it became clear that Harry had found a woman he felt could be his own rock to cling on to in a turbulent life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all those reasons, the nation invested such hope in their union â one which also provided an incredible opportunity to breathe fresh life into the institution of royalty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here was a beautiful, successful, independent young woman from a mixed-race background who had made her own way in life against considerable odds, and whose ambition and ability were an inspiration to so many.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is a big difference between being a famous soap actress and a member of the Royal Family, and grasping that distinction is something Meghan has clearly struggled with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a minor Hollywood celebrity, she has always seemed curiously ill-at-ease with the public nature of her role as royal consort, uncomfortable with the proprietorial nature of the deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, for whatever reason, Harry seems to have been distanced from his own family in the same way Meghan extracted herself from much of her own, and also walked away from her first husband.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, let's be clear: while the temptation is to blame Meghan for the couple's decision to walk away, in truth the ultimate responsibility lies with Harry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan at least has the excuse that she was not born to this role, that she had no previous experience, that she could not have ever truly known how it would turn out. He, by contrast, knew exactly what he was letting her in for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry's own struggles before he met Meghan may have played some part in his choice of bride. Had he married a more conventional woman, a member of the British upper classes, he would never have had the chance to escape the institution that, in his heart of hearts, he still blames for the loss of his mother. In some ways, Meghan is for Harry the ultimate excuse for an opt-out. She may be the catalyst, but she's not the cause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also, perhaps, explains why he has, time and again, ridden to her defence so passionately. Through her, he has seized the chance to hit back at all the injustices he perceives as having persecuted his late mother, to do for Meghan what as a young boy he could never do for Diana.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a more straightforward level, to see someone you love judged because of who and what you stand for is so very hard, especially when you have no say in the matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry was raised to this life, he did not choose it; he has, for all his faults, endured great personal suffering because of it. And to have to stand by and watch it make the woman he loves so clearly unhappy must be agonising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is this, I think, that explains his decision. And also, looking back over the past 18 months, his gradual detachment from his family â his brother William, to whom he has always been so close, his father Charles â and some of his oldest friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And at the very least he could have warned them of his sudden departure plans. Fired up with a determination to make a success of his marriage at all costs, to succeed where his father failed, he has turned his back on so much of what made him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also why, since he married Meghan, we have witnessed the birth of a new Harry, one shaped less in the image of his own family and more in the mould of Meghan and her fashionable and wealthy international circle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The woke, somewhat humourless and very entitled Harry we see before us now is almost unrecognisable as the fellow we knew and loved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, people grow up, they change. We can't forever expect him to be happy-go-lucky Harry. But still, it's quite a transformation. And so it's goodbye Windsor, hello Winnipeg, or whatever corner of North America where they feel most at home. What else is there to say, save to offer our best hopes for happiness with their son. And perhaps to add: be careful what you wish for.Â </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak">Â </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold">Their very starry new social circle: From the Clooneys to Oprah, ALISON BOSHOFF reveals the not-so regal A-list celebrity set who'll welcome them with open arms</span></p><div class="mol-img-group floatXWHalfRHS" style="style"> <div class="mol-img"> <div class="image-wrap"> <img id="i-b89b24fa3df70360" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23173090-7866007-Best_friends_Meghan_Markle_with_Jessica_Mulroney-a-78_1581587583632.jpg" height="823" width="470" alt="Best friends: Meghan Markle with Jessica Mulroney" class="blkBorder img-share" style="max-width:100%" /> </div> <noscript> <img id="i-b89b24fa3df70360" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23173090-7866007-Best_friends_Meghan_Markle_with_Jessica_Mulroney-a-78_1581587583632.jpg" height="823" width="470" alt="Best friends: Meghan Markle with Jessica Mulroney" class="blkBorder img-share" /> </noscript> </div> <p class="imageCaption">Best friends: Meghan Markle with Jessica Mulroney</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Starting at their wedding in May 2018 â which featured a startling number of celebrity pals of the bride â it was abundantly clear that the Sussexes were forging a starry new social circle, away from stuffier royal circles and Harry's old school and Army pals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The friends with whom they will be spending more time and, quite possibly, striking high-profile media deals, are the image of what Harry and Meghan want to become.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are super-successful career-minded sophisticates, based internationally, who have both giant incomes and impressive portfolios of charity work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oprah Winfrey â who it appears had barely met Meghan in 2018 (although she had done yoga on her lawn with Meghan's mum Doria) â has already snagged Harry to contribute to an Apple TV documentary about mental health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe she will be a conduit for further lucrative media work for the couple as they strive to gain that 'financial independence' of the statement. Certainly, she remains the 'Queen' in America, where she has a $340million fortune and her own TV network and is generally rated as the most influential woman in media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan is also very close to Oprah's best friend and confidante Gayle King, a TV news anchor with CBS. Gayle spent time with the couple at Frogmore as they awaited the birth of Archie. She was among the invited few who came to that baby shower in New York â an event which, curiously, Meghan's mother did not attend.

In return, the Prince lent support to her 'Full Effect' education programme for under-privileged teenagers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GEORGE AND AMAL Clooney attended the royal wedding in May 2018. It seems that it is barrister Amal, who grew up in Buckinghamshire, who fostered the friendship after being introduced to Meghan by mutual friends at the exclusive London private members club, Soho House. She has since opened her contacts book to Meghan, recommending everyone from hair stylists to interior designers and key staff members. In August 2018, the pair spent a long weekend with actor George and Amal at the Clooneys holiday home on Lake Como, Italy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps more surprising is the inclusion of David and Victoria Beckham, actor, comedian and chat show host James Corden and his wife Julia, and fashion designer Misha Nonoo and her billionaire oil heir husband Mike Hess. This new social landscape took shape in 2018 when Prince Harry and Meghan based themselves in a rented house in Oxfordshire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan's close friends, the tennis star Serena Williams, and the Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, were entertained at Soho Farmhouse by the couple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also saw Jessica Mulroney, Meghan's best friend for years and sometime stylist. She is based in Toronto and it is here that the Royal couple are expected to buy a temporary base.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pre-Harry, Meghan spent many weekends in Toronto enjoying family time with her and her husband Ben, a TV anchor, and son of the former Canadian PM. Their children John, Brian, and Ivy were among the page boys and flower girls at the Royal wedding and regard Meghan as an honorary aunt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan's best friend, Markus Anderson, who works for the Soho House group, remains a key member of the Duchess's 'support team' and regularly socialises with the Royal couple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was Anderson who invited her to join Soho House in Toronto four years ago when she was a little known TV actress based there and he facilitated all of Harry and Meghan's early dates at Soho Houses in London and in Oxfordshire. He also arranged her low-key hen weekend celebrations â at Soho Farmhouse of course âand persuaded the pair to attend the boozy launch of the new Soho House in Amsterdam.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Markus is also very good friends with New York-based fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who is said to have introduced the couple to each other. She and Harry went to Misha's wedding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The royal couple are also close to James Corden and his wife Julia. James made a speech at the eoyal wedding dressed as King Henry VIII, at the reception. Julia now has a new job running the interior design company Charles &amp; Co with Vicky Charles, who used to oversee all Soho House interior design. She is said to have lent her touch to the Sussexes' house at Frogmore.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Advice on bicontinental living and its complexities can be offered by the Beckhams, who spend time in LA where they used to live, and Miami where David has a football team, as well as having a barn conversion just around the corner from Soho Farmhouse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry is particularly close to the former footballer whom he has known for years through charitable causes, while fashion designer Victoria has become a huge fan of Meghan's. The entire Beckham clan went to Australia to support Harry at the Invictus Games â for which David is an ambassador â in Sydney.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other friends include Stella McCartney, another Soho Farmhouse regular, often with her young family in tow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan has passed through her professional life forging and, if necessary, dropping various friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The broadcaster Piers Morgan was once a contact and recipient of her charm when she was a relative nobody on Suits. After she met Harry, he was dropped. Socialite Lizzy Cundy was introduced to her at a charity event pre-Harry: Lizzy says that they were friends but that she too was sent into social Siberia once starrier prospects hove into view.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the story has been repeated. Others who have proved not quite Meghan's cup of chai soy latte are Harry's old crowd of drinking buddies like Guy Pelly, Tom and Lara Inskip and Astrid Harbord. Friends in this set were grumbling last summer that they 'never saw Harry any more. 'He's even thought to have given up shooting under the influence of Meghan, which put him firmly out of those circles in any case. They will surely see even less of him now.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak">Â </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">As another royal departs with an American divorcee...Â History is repeating â but AN WILSON believes it may be for the bestÂ Â </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can only be described as an abdication.

Yet there seems little doubt that their decision has shocked Buckingham Palace and the wider Royal Family as it has shocked the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been suggested that Meghan and Harry made their bombshell announcement without consulting the Queen. If true, that is, in my view, an atrocious lapse of judgment. The wording from the Palace last night, that 'these are complicated issues that will take time to work through', hints that the decision to abandon their royal duties is perhaps not as final as Meghan and Harry might wish it to be.

Here was a breath of fresh air: a feminist, mixed-race American who had established a career for herself as an actress, joining a slightly stuffy English family. Yet the love affair between Meghan and the British press was doomed to be short-lived.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that this charming, intelligent, beautiful woman hadn't a clue what the monarchy really is, or what role minor members of the Royal Family have to play in public life. For his part, Harry perhaps didn't fully understand his own role as a younger son. Both seemed oblivious to the fact that the British monarchy is a delicate constitutional miracle, not a vehicle for its members to press home their views on the subjects that interest them, however noble.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A minor royal such as Harry or Meghan (Harry is now sixth in line to the throne) essentially exists to be on standby for public engagements that senior royals are too busy to fulfil. They must also keep their views private. Yet Meghan, as befitting her role as a socially conscious and ambitious career woman, wanted her views on everything from climate change to women's rights to be centre stage. Sooner or later, this lovable pair â the playboy prince with heroic war service behind him and the glamorous Californian â were perhaps always going to come a cropper.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter" style="style"> <div class="mol-img"> <div class="image-wrap"> <img id="i-fd6c09fc93e24404" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23169886-7866007-The_wedding_car_that_drove_the_future_Duchess_of_Sussex_to_be_ma-a-83_1581587585057.jpg" height="866" width="962" alt="The wedding car that drove the future Duchess of Sussex to be married to Prince Harry in St George's Chapel, Windsor, was the very car (above) that drove Wallis Simpson to attend the funeral of her husband, the former Edward VIII" class="blkBorder img-share" style="max-width:100%" /> </div> <noscript> <img id="i-fd6c09fc93e24404" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/13/09/23169886-7866007-The_wedding_car_that_drove_the_future_Duchess_of_Sussex_to_be_ma-a-83_1581587585057.jpg" height="866" width="962" alt="The wedding car that drove the future Duchess of Sussex to be married to Prince Harry in St George's Chapel, Windsor, was the very car (above) that drove Wallis Simpson to attend the funeral of her husband, the former Edward VIII" class="blkBorder img-share" /> </noscript> </div> <p class="imageCaption">The wedding car that drove the future Duchess of Sussex to be married to Prince Harry in St George's Chapel, Windsor, was the very car (above) that drove Wallis Simpson to attend the funeral of her husband, the former Edward VIII</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This sort-of abdication, this sort-of exile, allows Harry and Meghan to continue supporting their favourite charities and promoting the causes in which they so passionately believe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their millions of fans around the world will go on adoring them wherever they appear.

They felt they had no option but to revert to the tried and tested template of the 'working royal' and they have been a great asset to the institution ever since.

For when it comes to semi-royalty, who pays for what? When the Home Secretary is pressed to find cuts in the police budget, it will be hard to fall back on the old standard reply that 'we never comment on royal security'. What about semi-royal security? And how are British â or 'North American' - embassies and high commissions supposed to respond when the Sussexes decide to travel overseas on semi-royal business? It has been a question which diplomats have sometimes raised with the Foreign Office in connection with the Duke of York's travel overseas but the global profile of Sussexes is of an entirely different order of magnitude.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Friends of the Sussexes have heard the Duke angrily pointing out in private that very little of his costs fall on the taxpayer anyway. However, though most of the costs of his growing household currently fall on the Duchy of Cornwall â and will fall on the King in a future reign â there are still demands on the public purse for security, royal residences, royal transport and staff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All these things could have been addressed and, in large part, resolved if negotiations within the Palace had been continued in private.
