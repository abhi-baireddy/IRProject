Dollar Tree is under fire for stocking “potentially unsafe drugs” and cosmetics.
The Food and Drug Administration said in a news release on Thursday it sent a warning letter to Greenbrier International Inc., which does business as Dollar Tree, outlining “multiple violations of current good manufacturing practices at contract manufacturers used to produce Dollar Tree’s Assured Brand OTC drugs” and other products sold at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores.
“Americans expect and deserve drugs that are safe, effective and that meet our standards for quality,” Donald D. Ashley, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in the release.

Dollar Tree also was asked to schedule a meeting within 15 working days of receiving the letter and to “determine if you have any remaining drugs in your possession, either in your distribution network or in retail stores under the Dollar Tree, Family Dollar or any other retail store brands in your network.”Follow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko
