Navy SEAL platoon members painted a dark picture of Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, their leader who was acquitted of war crimes and had a minor charge cleared by President Trump, in leaked investigatory interview videos and text messages obtained by the New York Times.
Why it matters: The interviews, given by members of the platoon members that served under Gallagher, break the SEALs' unwritten code of silence and describe their leader as violent, "evil" and "toxic" â€” in contrast with Trump's portrayal of him as a hero.
What they're saying:"The guy is freaking evil," Special Operator First Class Craig Miller told investigators.
"The guy was toxic," said Special Operator First Class Joshua Vriens, a sniper.
"You could tell he was perfectly okay with killing anybody that was moving," added Special Operator First Class Corey Scott, a medic in the platoon.
