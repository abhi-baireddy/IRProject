The U.S. military conducted a “defensive” airstrike against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, less than a week after signing a historic peace deal with the militant group.
Afghan forces killed at least 17 Taliban members during those clashes.
"I spoke to the leader of the Taliban today," Trump told reporters on the South Lawn.
He didn't provide any more details, but Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed Trump spoke with Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
Taliban leaders and U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad signed the historic peace deal in Doha, Qatar.
