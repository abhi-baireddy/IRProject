He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans “first.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Earlier Friday, the House gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate — their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he’d try to force a roll call vote — though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday.</p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="/></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-RS93LZInhVA-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/RS93LZInhVA/0.jpg" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"/></div></div></div><div class="social-embed Component-embed-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75" id="se2:00820660-6ae0-11ea-f87e-298f3f24abf3"><iframe class="Component-iframe-0-2-81 Component-iframe-0-0-2-82" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nRyaf/10/" id="datawrapper-chart-nRyaf" title="Data Wrapper Interactive" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“Today we’ve all acknowledged our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. She said Americans deserve a full-on government response “to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation’s all but overwhelmed health care system.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-84 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-85">Economic Impact of the Outbreak:</div><ul class="list-0-2-86"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-89"><a class="link-0-2-90" href="/c6836a31718b40a769b4a5b60b62da5e">– <!-- -->Staying afloat: $2.2 trillion bill offers economic lifeline</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-89"><a class="link-0-2-90" href="/2d9e4904307e5d1c18ecba79c2dabb1a">– <!-- -->Stocks drop, but hold on to weekly gains after a big rally</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-89"><a class="link-0-2-90" href="/194c694606064bc83a4850d04246bde8">– <!-- -->Jobless claims soar in Oregon from COVID-19 layoffs</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-89"><a class="link-0-2-90" href="/e11863d3b33dee4ee9790600f4903b80">– <!-- -->EU leaders order up recovery plan for after coronavirus</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing,” said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and we will overcome this one.”</p><div class="social-embed Component-embed-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75" id="se0:987a7640-6ae0-11ea-d900-155c37592989"><iframe class="Component-iframe-0-2-81 Component-iframe-1-0-2-87" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eb3ZP/7/" id="datawrapper-chart-eb3ZP" title="Data Wrapper Interactive" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Despite reservations, arch-conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to back the bill, which moved quickly through a Congress that’s been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Reps. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., announced Friday that they’d tested positive, bringing the number of infected lawmakers to five. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with their small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits, deferrals of student loans, and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis. </p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-84 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-85">Latest on the Pandemic:</div><ul class="list-0-2-86"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-89"><a class="link-0-2-90" href="/94d68c23955a4d7222f6b9cb47ea89cc">– <!-- -->Virus test results in minutes?

Top congressional Democrats were not invited to the White House signing ceremony, said Democratic aides speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the situation. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">And in a statement released after the signing, Trump objected to efforts to establish congressional oversight of spending in the bill and said his administration “will continue the practice of treating provisions like these as advisory and non-binding.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some, like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district, came close to tears.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Others couldn’t restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous, such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Still, in a chamber increasingly populated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks, Friday’s debate was a noteworthy break.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“We have no time to dither,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced plans to seek a roll call vote. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday’s session to block Massie’s move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts -- especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.</p><div id="afs:Content:8677760165" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-92">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-93 overrideArticle" href="/tag/Economy">Economy</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The legislation dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78

Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday's session to block Massie's move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts -- especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8677760165\">Full Coverage: Economy\u003c/div>\u003cp>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The legislation dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. \u003c/p>\u003cp>—\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Zeke Miller, Mary Clare Jalonick and Matthew Daly contributed.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Congress","headline":"Trump signs $2.2T stimulus after swift congressional votes","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"990c1173b94940d4b7565f255062078e","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2099a53bb8adf2def7ee7329ea322f9d","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"2099a53bb8adf2def7ee7329ea322f9d_24a17aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"thers remained safely in their home districts.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["d0f27afc1eb54ea2948d69db7645b541","54b4a832ca1247ecba3d63949f486a31","b187b1e8bc0641a4a184d7538a1f0639","98d0b16d10a94580843b62053cf03f17","12593d1afb0e417abd1e345aa7446dae","d1352a67045b4aaebc2b790a589a5cec","ce36f3ee87e440a5b7d065ffa5006d15","507976561f5f4095910267c337d8d02f","990c1173b94940d4b7565f255062078e","610f6c89ef5a4e049869deddaeeefab3","cce3c37c7c854493b99f4958df422cc3","a100b3783ed3435fbcc4181b684836f2","e31cf9c4b1f745cc819db99e4362aa79","e644c654c80b48be84fa63569ed3d022","b2cf920b87cf4dfbbe1ea448814dba96"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/d0f27afc1eb54ea2948d69db7645b541/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump speaks before he signs the coronavirus stimulus relief package in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, March 27, 2020, in Washington.

That follows two weeks of relentless selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 12.8% weekly gain was its biggest since 1938, thanks largely to Boeing, which climbed 70.5% this week. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stocks had soared over the previous three days as the relief bill moved closer to becoming law. It passed the House Friday afternoon and President Donald Trump signed it later in the day. The bill includes direct payments to households, aid to hard-hit industries like airlines and support for small businesses. Despite the help, analysts expect markets to remain turbulent until the outbreak begins to wane. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even after the rally this week the market is still down 25% from the peak it reached a month ago. The outbreak has forced widespread shutdowns that has ground much of the U.S. economy to a halt. This week more than 3 million people filed for unemployment benefits, shattering previous records. It's the first of what is sure to be many grim signs of the toll the virus is taking on the economy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The key at this point is getting a handle on the spread of the virus so that then we can start to think about what (economic) growth looks like for the remainder of the year,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The push to deliver financial relief is taking on more urgency as the outbreak continues to widen. The number of cases in the U.S. has now surpassed those in China and Italy, climbing to more than 86,000 known cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The worldwide total has topped 550,000, and the death toll has climbed to more than 25,000, while more than 127,000 have recovered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Investors have yet to get a clear picture of exactly how badly the crisis has hurt corporate profits, the ultimate driver of stock prices. Very few companies have dared to issue forecasts capturing the damage, though traders are girding for discouraging results in the next few weeks as earnings reporting season begins. Many companies have simply withdrawn their profit forecasts altogether. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the start of this year, analysts expected S&amp;P 500 companies' earnings would grow 4.4% in the January-March quarter. They now expect earnings will be down 4.1%, according to FactSet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earnings for airlines, which have been hit by lost bookings as businesses and individuals canceled travel plans to minimize their risk of contracting the virus, are expected to be catastrophically bad. Delta went from an expected 2.2% decline to a 108% plunge. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even the current forecasts may not yet reflect the size of the potential earnings declines this year, with only 15% of analysts having adjusted their estimates within the past couple of weeks, according to a report by Credit Suisse. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The latest bout of selling left the S&amp;P 500 down 88.60 points, or 3.4%, to 2,541.47. The Dow slid 915.39 points, or 4.1%, to 21,636.78. The Nasdaq lost 295.16 points, or 3.8%, to 7,502.38. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 48.33 points, or 4.1%, to 1,131.99.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cruise operators Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival led the decliners in the S&amp;P 500 Friday. The industry has been among the hardest hit by the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The companies are down more than 70% so far this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The price of crude oil slid 4.8% to close at $21.51 a barrel. Goldman Sachs has forecast that it will fall well below $20 a barrel in the next two months because storage will be filled to the brim and wells will have to be shut in. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That's sure to cause even more trouble for energy companies, which are lagging far behind the rest of the market. The price of oil has plunged recently, in part due to a price war that broke out early this month between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The energy sector of the S&amp;P 500 has lost half its value this year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.68% from 0.81% late Thursday. Lower yields reflect dimmer expectations for economic growth and greater demand for low-risk assets. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The overall downturn in the markets in recent weeks is creating good opportunities for investors to buy into sectors of the market that will be “prevalent” for the next decade, including e-commerce and technology companies that focus on things like gene therapies, said Solita Marcelli, deputy chief investment officer, Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The strong rallies this week have prompted some analysts to suggest the worst of the selling could be over. But most expect stocks to touch on recent lows again until there have been enough sustained gains in the market, and progress in fighting the pandemic, to ease investors' fear of further declines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The takeaway from this week is the initial down phase has probably run its course,” Delwiche said. “Investors can get out of the duck-and-cover mode and start to figure out what they need to do. It doesn't mean that we've gotten an all-clear signal.”\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"Financial Markets","headline":"Stocks drop, but hold on to weekly gains after a big rally","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d9e4904307e5d1c18ecba79c2dabb1a","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"2d9e4904307e5d1c18ecba79c2dabb1a_13a9aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["f45997f1e8194ce383fcfb658da51616","2ddefa3936c7430ba02c4718c8002ec4"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/f45997f1e8194ce383fcfb658da51616/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"In this image provided by Jay Woods,  Woods, a Designated Market Maker with IMC and NYSE Floor Governor, who normally works on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, works in his home office in Basking Ridge, N.J., Thursday, March 26, 2020.

(AP) — Jobless claims are soaring in Oregon as the state nears the end of its first week under Gov. Kate Brown's stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Oregon Department of Employment said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since March 15, the state has received 76,500 initial unemployment claims. That's a sharp increase from the 4,900 claims the week of March 8, before the economic devastation of the new coronavirus took hold, the department said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hospitality and leisure jobs made up about half the 22,800 claims processed in the last week, signifying the impact of the executive order that banned dine-in service at restaurants and bars and banned non-essential travel. Schools are also closed until April 28.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>And as health-care workers struggle to find sufficient masks to protect themselves, a medical facility in Salem, Oregon, announced online that it would hand out kits on Thursday for people to make masks and return them assembled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The response was enormous.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So many cars lined up to receive the kits at a parking lot of a closed Kmart store that it caused a traffic jam. Police warned motorists of the snarled traffic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How do I get in?” one woman asked a volunteer through her rolled-down window before she was told all the masks had been pledged to motorists who arrived earlier. One man came on foot, after having abandoned his car in the traffic jam, and was told the same thing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Salem Health Hospitals &amp; Clinics cancelled its handouts for Friday because supplies were exhausted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were overwhelmed by the response from the community in this time of need. Thank you so very much for your willingness to help health care workers, neighbors and friends,” the facility said on its website.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A volunteer said hundreds of kits were handed out, enough to make more than 8,000 masks. It takes a half-hour to make each one at first, then the process speeds up as the maker gets familiar with the process. Dropoffs of completed masks are scheduled to start on Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The impact of COVID-19 was also being felt by employers and their workers. Deschutes Brewery, an iconic craft brewery, also said Wednesday that it will lay off 300 employees and close its pubs and tasting rooms. Other uniquely Oregon businesses, such as McMenamin's and Powell's Books, have laid off hundreds of workers as well.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oregon’s jobless rate was at a historic low last month of just 3.3%, but recent warnings have suggested unemployment could rise as high as 20% during the outbreak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown said earlier this week that she is ‘gravely concerned’ about Oregon's ability to deliver basic services over the next six months to a year because of the economic fallout from statewide closures, massive lay-offs by affected businesses and stay-at-home orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The state also on Wednesday delayed the personal tax filing deadline until July 15, meaning Oregon will have less money coming in as it scrambles to address the economic crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Also Thursday, the city of Hood River closed its motels, hotels, short-term vacation rentals, hosted home shares, bed and breakfasts, RV parks and campgrounds until April 14. The city said it took the action because despite the governor's stay-at-home order issued Monday, people are still traveling to the Columbia River Gorge in large numbers and not following social distancing requirements of maintaining at least six feet of space between people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Selsky reported from Salem, Oregon.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"OR--Virus Outbreak-Oregon","headline":"Jobless claims soar in Oregon from COVID-19 layoffs","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:194c694606064bc83a4850d04246bde8","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"194c694606064bc83a4850d04246bde8_4a1aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["203696906b374798bafec80f9a3f680d","b03db1684829432b845b772c00023904","5bde7c1d4a714cd59652f558050bc3d7","d6398343aa4f48debdee6d941c026512"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/203696906b374798bafec80f9a3f680d/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"People from Salem Health Hospitals &amp; Clinics, hand out kits to make surgical masks causing a traffic jam in Salem, Ore., on Thursday, March 26, 2020.

Spain has just prolonged a state of emergency, while French President Emmanuel Macron launched “Operation Resilience,” a military-backed response to combat the illness.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This crisis is exceptional and unique and requires a very strong answer,\" EU Council President Charles Michel told reporters after the summit. Euro zone finance ministers will have to continue working and make proposals on tools “within two weeks,\" he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a joint statement, the leaders said those economic “proposals should take into account the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 shock affecting all our countries.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>As the virus has taken hold, the Commission — the guardian of the EU’s rule book — has permitted unprecedented border and economic measures so that embattled member countries like Italy and Spain, but also many others, can save supply chains and businesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But while the leaders all acknowledge the extent of the crisis and the need to support Italy in particular, they are divided over whether to use every economic tool at their disposal now or keep something in reserve should a second wave of infections start.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Finance ministers from the 19 countries using the euro currency agreed in principle this week to letting partners in distress borrow up to 2% of their gross domestic product from the European Stability Mechanism, a bailout fund set up during the debt crisis a decade ago with lending assets of 410 billion euros ($444 billion).\u003c/p>\u003cp>A group of nine nations wants the immediate rollout of “coronabonds,” shared debt backed by all euro zone countries. This would let even those hardest-hit borrow at sustainably low interest rates as their spending balloons on hospitals and measures to stop businesses going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That idea is anathema, though, to countries like Germany and the Netherlands, which have long objected to common borrowing because of the risk it leaves them holding the check for the finances of shakier countries and reduces incentives for other countries to control their deficits.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Looking forward, the leaders demanded an action plan to help their economies recover once the crisis is over.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Europe must “start to prepare the measures necessary to get back to a normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth,” the leaders' joint statement said. It underlined that the plan must include “a coordinated exit strategy, a comprehensive recovery plan and unprecedented investment.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coronavirus crisis comes just nine months before the EU’s long-term budget expires. Talks on the next seven-year spending plan are in a deadlock, with a small group of countries, led by the Netherlands, refusing to contribute more money to fill a gap left by the departure of Britain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said her office and agencies stand ready to support the EU's 27 member countries with every tool at her disposal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“But we must be very clear, we are in the final year of a seven-year budget. This crisis shows how important, indeed crucial, it is to have a budget that can deal with complex crises such as this one,” she told reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As governments wrestle over shared borrowing, the European Central Bank stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy. The central bank dropped a longstanding limit on its bond purchase stimulus of no more than a third of a country's government bonds.

It said the producer agreed to replace the returned tests and another 582,000 tests ordered with kits that would meet requirements. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chinese authorities said Thursday that the manufacturer did not have a license to sell the products. But Spain said the company did have permission to do so in Europe and the kits came with European Union certificates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Spanish government initially said 9,000 tests, not 8,000, had proved unreliable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week called the rapid tests a “game changer” and said his government had ordered 3.5 million of them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.K. hopes the tests will allow people who have had COVID-19 and recovered to go back to work, safe in the knowledge that they are immune, at least for now. That could ease the country's economic lockdown and bring back health care workers who are being quarantined out of fears they may have the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many scientists have been cautious, saying it's unclear if the rapid tests provide accurate results.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past few months, much of the testing has involved doctors sticking something akin to a long cotton swab deep into a patient’s nose or throat to retrieve cells that contain live virus. Lab scientists pull genetic material from the virus and make billions of copies to get enough for computers to detect the bug. Results sometimes take several days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rapid antigen tests have shorter swabs that patients can use themselves to gather specimens. They are akin to rapid flu tests, which can produce results in less than 15 minutes. They focus on antigens — parts of the surface of viruses that trigger an infected person's body to start producing antibodies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health authorities in China, the United States and other countries have offered few details on the rates of false positive and false negative results on any coronavirus tests.

Some versions have been described as finger-prick tests that can provide important information in minutes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Antibody tests are most valuable as a way of seeing who has been infected in the recent past, who became immune to the disease and — if done on a wide scale — how widely an infection has spread in a community.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The antibody tests also will allow scientists to get a better understanding of how deadly coronavirus is to all people, because they will provide a better understanding of how many people were ever infected, ranging from those who never showed symptoms to those who became fatally ill.
