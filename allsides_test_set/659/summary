President Donald Trump speaks before he signs the coronavirus stimulus relief package in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, March 27, 2020, in Washington.
It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nationâ€™s all but overwhelmed health care system.
Top congressional Democrats were not invited to the White House signing ceremony, said Democratic aides speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the situation.
Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers.
There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.
