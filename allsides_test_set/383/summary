Here is a statement I never thought I would make: I feel bad for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
For the moment, as Trump must focus all his efforts toward acquital in a likely January trial in the Senate, Trump can’t hand out any concessions to anyone, especially North Korea.
Let’s say Kim does something that is not a nuclear weapons test or ICBM launch.
My hope is that Trump, wanting to achieve something substantial he can put in front of U.S. voters before the 2020 election, will see North Korea as that opportunity.
America would also provide North Korea a security guarantee that it does not seek regime change, while also swapping liaison offices and signing a political declaration ending the Korean War.
