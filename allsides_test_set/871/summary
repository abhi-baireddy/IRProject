Forecasters had expected that 5.46 million jobs would be lost in the week ending Saturday.
"That means over the past month, at least 13.25% of employed workers lost their jobs," said Nick Bunker, a director of economic research at Indeed.com.
Over 11 million workers now receive unemployment benefits, which is a record high, according to the Labor Department.
The current unemployment rate is 16% based upon the recent number of jobs lost, according to Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist for the Treasury Department.
In the past, the largest number of workers claiming unemployment benefits over a four-week period was 2.7 million in 1982.
