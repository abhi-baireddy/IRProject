WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way, the top U.S. general said on Tuesday.
The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China.
A Washington Post opinion column published on Tuesday said the U.S. State Department in 2018 warned in diplomatic cables about safety and management weaknesses at a WIV laboratory.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to directly address the Washington Post column in interviews on Tuesday.
â€œWe know this is a global pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China.
