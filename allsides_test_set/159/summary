But experts fear the change will open gaps in the oversight of weapons exports because the Commerce Department does not yet have access to the watchlist that the State Department has spent years building.
Last year, the Government Accountability Office concluded that without the State Department list, which has more than 200,000 entries, the Commerce Department may lack critical information to effectively screen parties.
One of them, the Commerce Department’s Consolidated Screening List, or CSL, focuses on red flags specific to exports.
Kyle “Dusty” Foggo, once a top CIA official, is among the names missing from Commerce’s public screening list.
Wolf, whose practice focuses on export and arms traffic regulation, said the Commerce Department’s Consolidated Screening List is only part of the licensing process.
