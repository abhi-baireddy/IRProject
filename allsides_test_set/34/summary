Edward Snowden speaks via video link during a news conference in New York City, U.S. September 14, 2016.
(Brendan McDermid/Reuters)A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that the U.S. government may collect any profits made by former NSA worker Edward Snowden through sales of Snowden’s book and paid speeches.
“Snowden accepted employment and benefits conditioned upon prepublication review obligations.”Snowden’s legal team criticized the decision.
Advertisement“It’s farfetched to believe that the government would have reviewed Mr. Snowden’s book or anything else he submitted in good faith,” Snowden lawyer Brett Max Kaufman of the ACLU Center for Democracy told the Washington Post.
The NSA ended the program in 2015 after Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, banning the collection of metadata that reveals such information on phone calls.
