Bill Wehrum, the Environmental Protection Agency’s air pollution chief who oversaw key rollbacks of Obama-era climate regulations, is stepping down amid an ethics probe into his ties to former industry clients.
“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.
While at EPA, Wehrum met with Utility Air Regulatory Group, his former client and an umbrella organization funded by several companies that opposed stricter limits on pollution from coal-fired plants.
Mandy Gunasekara, a former top aide to Wehrum at EPA, downplayed the probe’s impact on her former boss’s decision to leave.
Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned last July amid a mountain of ethical violations.
