Senate Democrats say Congress needs to pass a new economic relief package that would also reopen Obamacare exchanges for people needing treatment for the coronavirus.
Democrats will push to include a provision to open a special enrollment period in a new economic relief package that has yet to be drafted.
Congress has already passed three federal aid measures, including a $2.2 trillion package signed into law last week.
“There are a lot of people who don’t have healthcare, many of whom are qualified” for the Obamacare exchanges, Schumer said, adding, “It’s something I would look at” including in a new round of economic relief legislation.
“We Democrats are going to hold the Trump administration's feet to the fire, to make sure they get it done and get it done right,” Schumer told reporters.
