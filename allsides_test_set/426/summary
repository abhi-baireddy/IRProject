Only 1,800 employees make up CBP's AMO component, about 10% of the size of Border Patrol's workforce.
For decades, AMO air crews (previously run by a different federal agency) have made some of the biggest drug hauls by a border agency component, only these take place thousands of miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
At any given time, two to three crews are deployed to Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and other nearby countries.
Crews may fly 1,000 miles west of Mexico to the Galápagos Islands because smugglers try to avoid detection by going that far out.
What we have is the finest group of aviators and sensor operators and flight engineers that I've ever seen,” Jordan said.
