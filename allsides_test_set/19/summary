In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate on Wednesday passed a $2-trillion economic stimulus package — the largest ever — designed to pump money directly into Americans’ pockets while also shoring up hospitals, businesses, and state and local governments struggling against the coronavirus pandemic.
Government is the only force large enough to staunch the bleeding and begin healing,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.
Friday’s vote will be held by a voice vote, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.)
Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib tweeted that she is angry the Senate bill doesn’t help people whose water was shut off for lack of payment during the outbreak.
“The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today,” McConnell said.
