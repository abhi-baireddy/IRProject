Female genital mutilation (FGM) will not be eradicated unless women are economically empowered to make their own decisions, an activist stressed today, as the United Nations released data warning that the ancient practice may take centuries to eliminate.
More:Estimated to affect at least 200 million girls and women globally, FGM causes multiple mental and physical health problems.
UNICEF also voiced concern about increased "medicalisation" of FGM hampering global efforts to end the practice.
"Doctor-sanctioned mutilation is still mutilation.
Trained healthcare professionals who perform FGM violate girls' fundamental rights, physical integrity and health," said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore.
