President Trump is calling on Congress to enact a payroll tax holiday, which would amount to a roughly $807 billion tax cut, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model — far bigger, in annual terms, than his 2017 tax cut.
"That’s why we see proposals to distribute cash, cut payroll taxes, etc."
"A payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who can't work."
"A payroll tax cut is not sufficient."
Another option to get money in the hands of the public quickly would be to accelerate tax refunds.
