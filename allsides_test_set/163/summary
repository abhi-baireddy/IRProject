President Trump’s administration is blacklisting several Russian military intelligence operatives involved in election interference around the world, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday.
Mnuchin unveiled sanctions on 15 operatives with Russia’s GRU, the military intelligence agency, while also blacklisting a former GRU officer.
“Treasury is sanctioning Russian intelligence operatives involved in cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 election and a wide range of other malign activities,” Mnuchin said.
But Treasury also put a spotlight on interference in Western elections through “a broad Russian effort” called Project Laktha.
“Treasury sanctioned these companies because of their ownership and control by sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, not for the conduct of the companies themselves,” Mnuchin explained.
