WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. diplomats who expressed alarm about President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine will serve as star witnesses when Democrats bring their impeachment case against Trump directly to the public with televised congressional hearings next week, lawmakers said on Wednesday.
The hearings would be a likely prelude to articles of impeachment - formal charges - against Trump being brought to a vote in the House.
Democrats said they had enough material to move forward with public impeachment hearings even though some Trump administration officials have refused to cooperate.

A quid pro quo is not necessary, however, to prove high crimes or misdemeanors, which is the standard the U.S. Constitution requires for the impeachment of a president.
