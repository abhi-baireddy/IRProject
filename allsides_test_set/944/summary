The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the case—without any noted dissent—means the public financing program is safe for the foreseeable future.
Each election cycle, all city residents are given $100 in democracy vouchers, which work as coupons that Seattleites may give to local political candidates.
As the lower courts recognized—and as the Supreme Court thankfully did not disturb—if that line of reasoning were accepted, it would undermine the very concept of public expenditures.
Fortunately, the Supreme Court let stand the decision rejecting this broadside attack and permitting the program to exist.
Public financing survives—and, in Seattle and elsewhere, it thrives.
