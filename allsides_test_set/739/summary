Anderson is also expected to say that in November 2018, when Russia seized three Ukrainian ships near Crimea, senior White House officials blocked the State Department from releasing a statement condemning Moscow's action.
"The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the President," Croft is expected to tell House lawmakers.
