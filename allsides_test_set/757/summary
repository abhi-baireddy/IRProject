As sophomoric as the term may be, I don't know what else besides "fake news" to call the national media's new narrative about tensions between President Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci.
A White House spokesman on Monday reacted to the new media-created line by confirming that Trump is not going to fire Fauci by stating, accurately, that the "ridiculous" notion literally came out of nowhere.
A former Republican congressional candidate reacted to the CNN interview with skepticism of Fauci, tweeting, "Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives.
Trump reposted that comment in his own tweet, adding, "Sorry Fake News, itâ€™s all on tape.
But the CNN interview and the Trump tweet proved, according to the Washington Post's Aaron Blake, that "any illusions about a lack of tension between Trump and Fauci were put to rest."
