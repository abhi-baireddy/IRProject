Congressman: “Sir, let me repeat my question: Did you ever speak to the president about this complaint?” Congress is investigating allegations that President Trump pushed a foreign government to dig up dirt on his Democratic rivals.
Not counting the president himself, these are the people that appear the most: First, Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani.
“So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden.” “Of course I did!” A person Giuliani worked with, Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general.
When a new president took office in May, Volodymyr Zelensky, Zelensky said that he’d replace Lutsenko.
House Democrats have now subpoenaed several people mentioned in the complaint, as an impeachment inquiry into the president’s conduct continues.
