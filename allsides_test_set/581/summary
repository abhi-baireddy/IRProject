Image copyright ReutersPrime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care in hospital after his coronavirus symptoms "worsened", Downing Street has said.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care.
After very, very little information was shared today, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST.
And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness.
Asked whether that was appropriate, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson would "take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor".
