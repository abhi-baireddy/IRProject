The cybersecurity firm responsible for a report Monday suggesting Russia hacked into Burisma Holdings is representing half of the 2020 presidential candidates.
Area 1’s co-founder previously worked with CrowdStrike, a group responsible for not preventing hackers from gaining access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails in 2016.
He gave the same amount in September of that year to New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat who ended his presidential campaign Monday.
The New York Times first reported on Area 1’s published data Monday but did not mention Area 1’s work with Warren’s campaign.
Darche, Area 1’s co-founder, said, “We are 100% certain” that the GRU was behind the hacking.
