The Russian energy giant Rosneft's trading arm has handled over half the oil coming out of Venezuela and has actively helped the country evade sanctions through a variety of means, such as ship-to-ship transfers, which conceal the oil's origin.
The decision was cleared by President Trump and was discussed Saturday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Trump has spoken in the past with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the importance of a democratic transition in Venezuela and stressed the administration's concerns about companies doing business with the Maduro government.
"We are at 50% or 60%," the senior administration said about the efforts to pressure the Venezuela leader.
The administration seeks the "first fully democratic Western Hemisphere," this official said, as part of the Trump Doctrine foreign policy agenda.
