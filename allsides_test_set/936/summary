One of Trump administration's top advisers on the coronavirus response said Saturday that by May, the U.S. should be in the "ballpark" of the diagnostic capacity needed for the economy to begin to reopen.
“By May we’ll have a lot more testing than we do now,” Admiral Brett Giroir told Bloomberg.
Whether we are exactly there depends on some factors, including how much is circulating and where regionally this falls out.
Giroir explained that the government is working to make four types of diagnostic tests needed to reopen the economy safely: widespread surveillance, testing of specific symptoms, contact-tracing and anti-body testing.
According to the COVID-19 Tracking Project, the volume of testing in the U.S. has skyrocketed since Giroir assumed his responsibilities.
