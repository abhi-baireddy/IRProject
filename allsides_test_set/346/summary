(CNN) The struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic has opened a new front in the long-running conflict between blue cities and red states.

While some Republican governors elsewhere imposed strict uniform measures, the clash divided these states along familiar lines.
Across many states with Republican governors, these diverging perspectives have contributed to sharp splits between the states' policies and those adopted by the largest population centers.
In those red states, Republican legislators have typically argued for invalidating local ordinances on the grounds that "there needs to be uniform statewide rules," Briffault says.
