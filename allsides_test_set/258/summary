(CNN) The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults — ages 60 and up — who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.
Some tips are applicable to every generation, but there are specific precautions older adults should take to protect their health.
What's your risk levelThe CDC says "older adults" and people with severe chronic illness are more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19.
