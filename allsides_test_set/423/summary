Jubilation erupted at Likud party headquarters Monday evening as exit polls streamed in revealing that Netanyahu had defeated Gantz.
But Netanyahuâ€™s surge in seats gives him a decisive advantage over Gantz, who is projected to win 32 seats.
On Tuesday, Liberman maintained his role as the kingmaker who could give Netanyahu the seats needs to form a government, but Liberman says he won't compromise.
Netanyahu hopes a potential parliamentary majority will give him the power and protection he wants to fight the corruption charges against him.
His trial will begin on March 17 but he hopes to clinch together a government majority before then.
