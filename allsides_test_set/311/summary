House Democratic leaders vowed Friday morning that the lower chamber will pass a massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill later in the day, despite last-minute hurdles erected by a conservative member that have sent lawmakers scrambling to return to Washington.
If that’s the case, the House can approve the measure on Friday, despite Massie’s gambit.
The House opened the floor at 9 a.m. to begin that debate, which was initially expected to run for two hours.
Asked if it will move by voice vote or recorded vote, Pelosi left it up in the air.
"So we get this done one way or the other today or tomorrow," said Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee.
