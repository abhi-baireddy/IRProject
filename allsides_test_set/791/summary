ETThe Justice Department announced Friday that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will not be charged following an allegation by the department's inspector general that he lied to investigators about a leak to the media.
McCabe has long been the target of Republican leaders who allege political bias within the FBI.
"We are pleased that Andrew McCabe and his family can go on with their lives without this cloud hanging over them."
McCabe has sued the Justice Department, alleging that his March 2018 firing by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a politically motivated act of retribution by Trump and "unlawful."
