“We do believe it is likely that that plane was shot down by an Iranian missile,” he said.
Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said recovering data from the black box flight recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year.
He also said Iran may request help from international experts if it is not able to extract the flight recordings.
The U.S. officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15.
Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations.
