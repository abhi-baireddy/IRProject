Thousands of people marched in cities around the country to demand that President Trump release his tax returns on Tax Day, in a demonstration that echoed the 2009 tax rallies that launched the Tea Party movement.
The March took place exactly eight years after the first major Tea Party rally to protest Obama policies on April 15, 2009, which was widely credited as the beginning of the far-right Tea Party movement.
Older people generally tend to care more about tax issues, and the Tea Party was made up mostly of older Americans: three-quarters of self-identified Tea Party members are over 45, according to a 2012 CBS News poll, and almost a third are over 65.
“It’s not just the Tea Party jackoffs who get to be patriotic.” Her husband Roderic Schmidt, who helped her carry the flag, agreed.
The largest Tea Party rally was in Atlanta, where 15,000 people reportedly showed up.
