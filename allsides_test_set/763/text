Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White released a statement on Friday announcing the indefinite suspension of Ulchi-Freedom Guardian along with two other Korean Marine Exchange Program training exercises, all set to take place in the next three months. She further hinted that additional moves will be made if productive negotiations with the North Koreans continue.

The Friday statement came after Mattis met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford, and national security adviser John Bolton to discuss U.S. efforts to achieve the goals set forth in the Singapore summit by President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump and Kim met in SIngapore last week to discuss plans for a complete denuclearization of North Korea.
