The commission did not say if any of the new cases were asymptomatic but on Tuesday reported that, of a total of 1,541 asymptomatic cases now being isolated and monitored for symptoms, 205 had come from overseas. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The move to disclose the number of asymptomatic cases comes amid scrutiny of China’s reported figures, which previously only included people who exhibited symptoms. While the proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, scientists say these “carriers” can still pass COVID-19 onto others who do end up getting sick. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">As China’s domestic outbreak has largely abated, some questioned whether the country’s failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections. China, where the virus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">CENTRAL, La. — Buses and cars filled a church parking lot as worshipers flocked to hear a Louisiana pastor who is facing misdemeanor charges for holding services despite a ban on gatherings amid the <a class="" href="/a25f04dd3484923e7fd1a59e3808d774">coronavirus pandemic</a><!-- -->.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">A few protesters turned out Tuesday evening, too, including a man shouting through a bullhorn against the gathering at the Life Tabernacle Church. Another demonstrator held up a sign reading: “God don’t like stupid.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Afterward, as people began leaving the church, some chatted outside the front doors and many appeared to not be adhering to social distancing recommendations to remain at least six feet apart.

Washington has identified 504 positive cases, with nine deaths. Mayor Muriel Bowser has issued a stay-home order for Washington’s approximately 700,000 residents.

The change is not permanent.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">News Corp. Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said the decision was necessary because of a rapid decline in advertising. The COVID-19 outbreak has brought a surge in new subscriptions to News Corp.’s online publications.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The journalists’ union — Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance — has called on the Australian government to provide financial help to several rural newspapers that have already stopped printing because of the lack of advertising.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">TOKYO — Japan’s post office says deliveries will stop to more than 150 nations beginning Thursday as flights carrying mail get canceled because of the growing coronavirus pandemic. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Mail will continue to the U.S., France, Australia, Hong Kong and a handful of other places, although delivery may be delayed, Japan Post said.
