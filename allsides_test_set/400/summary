The coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in its scope and duration, as has our response to it.
All of this has required a kind of political and economic flexibility that has the potential to change the way we think about and address future crises.
And it has, in some ways, accelerated the political realignment we first noticed in 2016 with the election of President Trump.
Keep in mind: Weâ€™re still in the beginning stage of our national response to the coronavirus.
Much more must be done to contain and defeat this pandemic, which means a lot more could change between now and November, both politically and economically.
