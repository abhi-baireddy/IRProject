WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday said the decision to reopen the country’s ailing economy ultimately rests with him, not state leaders, as he feuds with governors over when to allow Americans to return to work.
In a pair of tweets, Trump claimed he had the ultimate authority to loosen coronavirus outbreak measures as governors pushed ahead with their own plans for reopening their states, in some cases a coalition of governors looking at regions.
A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!” he added.
Gavin Newsom announced he was working with state leaders in Washington and Oregon on a similar framework for reopening as a region.
“He has no such inherent authority, nor is there any federal statute that purports to give him such authority,” he added.
