President Trump said Saturday that his willingness to combat homelessness in California and New York depends on whether their governors ask him “politely” for help.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development reported earlier this month that the number of homeless people in California increased 16.4%, contributing to a 2.7% rise in the homeless population nationwide.
Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said rents in the state are too high and about one-third of renters are “one emergency away” from losing their homes.
Mr. Newsom called on the federal government to put “real skin in the game.” He has criticized the Trump administration for creating “bureaucratic roadblocks” to the state obtaining federal aid for homeless people.
“Federal leadership matters,” the governor tweeted.
