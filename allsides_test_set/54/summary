President Trump reiterated Monday morning he is working closely with governors across the country to determine when to safely re-open the American economy.
For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government.
Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect.... â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.
With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue.
I call it our Opening Our Country Task Force or Council," Trump said Friday afternoon.
