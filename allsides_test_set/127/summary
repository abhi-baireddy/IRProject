Justice Brett Kavanaugh signaled that he is open to state-level abortion restrictions in a high-profile Supreme Court hearing Wednesday.
Kavanaugh questioned whether it was burdensome for Louisiana to make abortion doctors get permission to check patients into nearby hospitals if they could easily apply and get cleared to do so.
But the case specifically centered on regulations passed in 2014 in Louisiana that require doctors who perform abortions to acquire admitting privileges to nearby hospitals.
That was in part why the Supreme Court decided to take the issue up again.
It's not clear the Supreme Court will rule the same way it did in 2016.
