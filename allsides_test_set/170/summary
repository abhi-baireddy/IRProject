Bernie Sanders has endorsed Joe Biden for president.
Sanders didn't publicly back Biden when he withdrew last week from the primary, his second campaign for the White House.
Instead, he said he would continue amassing delegates ahead of the summer's Democratic National Convention and devote his time and resources to defeating President Trump in November's general election.
“This is further proof that even though Bernie Sanders won’t be on the ballot in November, his issues will be.
One thing that is missing is enthusiasm, however, as almost no one is excited about a Biden candidacy," Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote.
