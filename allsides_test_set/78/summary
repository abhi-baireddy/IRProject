President Trump wants to make everyone know who to thank when their coronavirus aid comes in the mail: namely, Donald J. Trump.
And the Washington Post just reported that President Trump's name will be on each check.
Bluntly put, the second gripe that Trump is "promoting himself" with this stunt is essentially a gripe that he is engaging in good politics.
No president's name has ever appeared on checks from the Internal Revenue Service before, and apparently the idea originated with Trump himself.
When President George W. Bush signed stimulus checks into law to combat the 2001 recession, he couldn't get his name on them.
