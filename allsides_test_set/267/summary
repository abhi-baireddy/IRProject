Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D) has vetoed legislation that would mandate state voters to show a photo ID before they vote in the 2020 presidential election, and every election after.
Last week, Beshear announced his veto of mandatory voter ID legislation that ensures all registered voters must prove their identity before they cast a ballot, starting in November.
According to Beshear, requiring voter ID creates “an obstacle” that results “in fewer people voting,” though research and data show otherwise.
In Alabama, which has a mandatory voter ID law, black American voters came out in droves in 2018 to help elect Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate.
About 92 percent said they had not experienced any voter suppression over the last decade.
