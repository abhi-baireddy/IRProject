It’s been a half-century since the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
Yet the environmental issues that Earth Day highlights are as urgent as ever.
Or will a commitment grow to more deeply understand and live in harmony with the natural world?
This year’s Earth Day, coming during a pandemic, is a reminder of the need for global action to solve a problem involving the whole planet.
If humanity is in harmony on that, it can find harmony with the natural world.
