Authorities said the former president, and others charged by the ICC, should appear before the court.
He told BBC Focus on Africa radio that Bashir and three others would be handed over to the ICC.
The court investigates and brings to justice people suspected of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute.
Prosecutors in Sudan have also charged him with the killing of protesters during the demonstrations that led to him being ousted.
