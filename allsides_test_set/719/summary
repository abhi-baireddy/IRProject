I was on a Zoom call this week with 3,000 college students hosted by the Veritas Forum.
Everybody I talk to these days seems eager to have deeper conversations and ask more fundamental questions:Are you ready to die?
If your lungs filled with fluid a week from Tuesday would you be content with the life you’ve lived?
I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a pit of fear in my stomach since this started that hasn’t gone away.
But gradually you discover that you have the resources to cope as you fight the fear with conversation and direct action.
