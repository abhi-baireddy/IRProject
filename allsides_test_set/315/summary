Oil prices skyrocketed on Thursday after President Donald Trump told CNBC Saudis and Russia will ease pressure on oil, ending a price war that has contributed to crude's massive plunge.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged 24.67% to settle at $25.32 per barrel, for its largest single-day percentage gain in history.
Given WTI's 59% decline this year a smaller gain, of course, now accounts for a much larger percentage move.
The president later tweeted that a production cut would be "great for the oil & gas industry!"
Oil production is typically discussed in terms of barrels per day, but Trump made no reference to the time frame of the cuts.
