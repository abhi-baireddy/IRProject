(Reuters) - Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine black people at a South Carolina church in 2015, has appealed his conviction and death sentence, with lawyers arguing he was too mentally ill to stand trial or represent himself at sentencing.
A jury found Roof guilty of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes resulting in death, for the shocking mass shooting at the landmark Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015.
Roof dismissed his defense attorneys just before trial and represented himself during jury selection.
The 2008 decision Indiana v. Edwards allows judges to force a lawyer on defendants who lack mental capacity, they said.
