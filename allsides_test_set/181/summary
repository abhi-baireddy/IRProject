This was the beginning of the end for our de facto national policy of open borders.
There are strains of left and socialist thinking, both historical and current, that are very hostile to open borders.
Given these unsavory bedfellows, are we sure that we, as leftists, want open borders?
Caplan’s case for open borders largely rests on two underlying premises: first, that closed borders are unethical, and second, that capitalism is good and open borders will only make it work more effectively.
That’s not to say that Caplan’s arguments have no merit, or that there’s no common ground to be found between leftist and libertarian advocates for open borders.
