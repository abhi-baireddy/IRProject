Picking Biden, who served eight years as vice president under Obama was “one of the best decisions I ever made,” the former president said in the video.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has released a statement on the expected endorsement, bashing both Obama and Biden and threatening defeat.
"Barack Obama spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.
Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party.
President Trump will destroy him.”
