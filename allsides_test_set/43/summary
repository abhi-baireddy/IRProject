What if New York’s electric grid were to be hit by another black swan during the pandemic, triggering blackouts across significant parts of the city?
This is the exact wrong time to be closing Indian Point, which by itself reliably provides about 25 percent of the electricity consumed in New York City.
Closing the plant will reduce the resilience of New York’s electric grid and increase the state’s reliance on natural gas for electricity production.
After seeing it up close, I became convinced that Indian Point is one of New York’s most valuable assets.
