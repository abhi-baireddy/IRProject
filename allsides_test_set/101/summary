The Israeli leader added that past deals had not had the "right balance between Israeli security and Palestinians aspirations."
The plan also includes a map of a contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank, with a proposed tunnel to connect the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
A small strip of land between the Egyptian border and the proposed land swap areas south of Gaza would remain Israeli territory and be subject to Israeli security control.
As part of the plan, Israel has agreed to halt settlement construction for four years.
While Trump and Netanyahu were giving their comments, Palestinian leaders were meeting in the West Bank to discuss the plan.
