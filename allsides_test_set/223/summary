“We've had a lot of families that are trying to change their options for birth support,” said Heather Delaney, owner and CEO of Maryland State Doulas.

Faced with no childcare and diminishing labor support, Erica and her husband decided to switch to home birth.
“Home birth midwives cannot take the same influx as a hospital,” Delaney said.
