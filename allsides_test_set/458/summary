The United States has officially become the hardest-hit country in the world by the global coronavirus pandemic, confirming a world-high 82,285-plus coronavirus cases, surpassing China, where it originated.
The U.S. confirmed-case death rate is just 1.4%, while the other most-infected countries are far less effective in keeping its infected citizens alive.
Indeed, New Orleans has the world's highest growth rate for virus cases, with the metro area accounting for some 70% of the roughly 1,800 cases in Louisiana.
On the world stage, only Germany has done a better job with keeping its confirmed-case death rate below that of the United States.
New York state, particularly because of New York City, has been the hardest-hit area in the U.S. with over 37,000 confirmed cases.
