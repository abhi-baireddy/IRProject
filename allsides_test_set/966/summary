(George Frey/AFP via Getty Images)White House Outlines 5G Security Strategy, Warns of ‘High-Risk’ VendorsThe United States needs to lead the development of 5G wireless network standards, assess any vulnerabilities to hacking, and address national security dangers posed by “high-risk” 5G vendors, according to a document titled “National Strategy to Secure 5G.”The strategy, recently released by the Trump administration, makes no mention of who “high-risk” 5G vendors might be, but the field of candidates is so narrow as to make clear the target is Huawei.
Washington has stressed that the Chinese company—founded in 1987 by a former People’s Liberation Army engineer—is an extension of the Chinese regime and that it assists Chinese intelligence.
The United States has gone to some lengths to exclude Huawei and other key Chinese players from its telecom infrastructure.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Huawei will supply up to 35 percent of the country’s 5G communications infrastructure.
5G technology enables cell phone networks to reach data transmission bandwidth comparable to Wi-Fi networks.
