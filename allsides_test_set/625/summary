The choices made by the young can be "the difference between life and death for someone else", WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
The WHO chief's remarks follow reports that young people in many countries are being complacent about health warnings, because of the greater susceptibility to the virus among older patients.
He added: "I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you.
Fewer than 1% of patients under the age of 50 died in China, according to the New York Times.
The WHO is now recommending "physical distance" instead of "social distancing" to help prevent transmission of the virus, Reuters reports.
