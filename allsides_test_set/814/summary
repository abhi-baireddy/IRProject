The U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday failed to meet a congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a court battle between Congress and the administration.
Earlier on Tuesday, the White House said Trump was unlikely to hand over his tax returns.
Democrats say they are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns.
Trump broke with a decades-old precedent by refusing to release his tax returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 or since being elected, saying he could not do so while his taxes were being audited.
Cohen said the president feared that releasing his returns could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties.
