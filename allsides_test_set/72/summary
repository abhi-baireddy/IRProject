On Thursday Google/Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent out a call for volunteers from Google to help Verily with its COVID-19 project, and received 1700 offers.
Google said in a tweet that workers at its Verily unit "are developing a tool to help triage individuals for COVID-19 testing."
It's not clear how many of the volunteers for the Verily project will end up actually contributing to it.
The big picture: Google has lots of employees in other parts of the company working on other virus-related issues.
