Some school districts are discussing mandatory remedial summer school for all kids once the pandemic has passed.
The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board endorsed such a measure, claiming that "there's no good argument against mandatory summer school.
CPS and parents—and the Chicago Teachers Union—must do whatever it takes to get school kids back on track."
"I don't think the time away from school will impact kids' intelligence," he says.
Forcing every kid to repeat the grade or attend summer school would be a punishment that most students did nothing to deserve.
