The United States is currently undertaking its population census, the once-a-decade effort to count every single person living here.
More than 150 other countries will join in this world census round—the 10-year period centered on 2020, and around 90 percent of the world’s population has already been or will be counted.
But while impressive on a human scale, a modern census is technologically unspectacular.
The American questionnaire asks just seven questions of each person, with a few more for each household as a whole.
