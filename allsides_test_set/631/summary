Gavin Newsom hailed President Donald Trump’s visit to California on Wednesday with a threat to sue Trump’s administration to block a controversial plan to increase water deliveries to the San Joaquin Valley.
The decision is designed to open the floodgates so that millions of gallons additional water can flow to urban Southern California and the Valley, where farmers are constantly clamoring for additional supplies.
Newsom, who has sued Trump over everything from air pollution to immigration, originally threatened to sue over the water plan last fall, saying it could harm the environment.
He added that administration officials overruled federal scientists who had argued that the Trump plan would harm fish and the Delta’s eco-system.
“I feel like it’s rock solid.”The amount of additional water that can be pumped will depend on the weather, he said.
