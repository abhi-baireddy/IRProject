The New York Times reported on Thursday that "intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected."
I suspect a Democratic member asked a briefer something along the lines of, "Do you assess that Russia is trying to reelect Trump?"
That's very different from that which the New York Times report implies: a high-confidence national intelligence assessment that Russia is interfering to see Trump triumph over any and all of the Democratic presidential primary field.
First off, any intelligence assessment that Russia is interfering to reelect Trump would require a wide depth of diverse, high-value sources.
On Ukraine, aside from the obvious impeachment issues, Trump has provided Kyiv with lethal weapons and high-value intelligence support.
