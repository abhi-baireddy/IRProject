href="https://reason.com/2020/04/14/trump-vows-to-cut-off-u-s-funding-to-the-world-health-organization/">put a hold on WHO funding yesterday</a>, isn't absolved of his own failures in confronting COVID-19. But there's no doubt that the WHO's response destroyed much of its credibility, damaged the field of public health, and failed to contain the pandemic.</p><p>The WHO's actions in response to COVID-19, in part, stemmed from its overly deferential stance towards China, which is its second-biggest financial contributor among 194 member states.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"A phenomenal collective action by the people of China to this response" is how Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-China mission, <a href="http://Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-China mission">described</a> China's handling of the outbreak on February 25, 2020, a day after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6r21My2bdw">praised</a> China's "rapid response," which he claimed "changed the course of this epidemic."</span></p><p>The WHO also praised China for releasing the virus's genome while neglecting to mention that it took them at least <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/new-coronavirus-cases-decline-as-there-are-fears-surgical-masks-disrupt-chinas-surveillance-networks/news-story/9db5cf3740174a3606a03ea8784bf7a7">17 days to do so</a>. It didn't report human-to-human transmission until late January—even though Chinese doctors suspected it at least a month earlier. Although the extreme lockdown of Wuhan likely saved thousands of lives, WHO scientists weren't allowed into Wuhan until 3 weeks after the outbreak first came to light, leaving open many questions about measures the government took in the interim. Meanwhile, the WHO praised the country for its supposed openness.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"China took action at the epicenter, and that helped prevent the spread to other provinces and the rest of the world," Ghebreyesus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Q0NhfQoG4">said</a> on February 15. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"As China has shown, this does not need to be a pandemic if we take action," WHO Executive Director Michael Ryan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQChCZWmkKg">said</a> on February 28. </span></p><p>As the virus continued spreading across Europe and reached America, the WHO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmMzon1_qt4">recommended</a> "no interference with international travel."</p><p>One country that ignored this advice was Taiwan, which also warned the WHO that it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-05/taiwan-s-advance-on-who-in-covid-19-shows-its-place-in-world">suspected that the virus was spreading through</a> human-to-human transmission, yet was ignored. Taiwan, which has one of the lowest rates of known COVID-19 infections per capita, was prevented from joining the WHO as a member country in 2015 by China, which refuses to acknowledge Taiwan's independence.</p><p>In late March, World Health Organization epidemiologist Bruce Aylward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJLl4Q8R1DQ">declined</a> to answer a Hong Kong reporter's question about Taiwan—or even acknowledge its existence.</p><p>As Taiwan was distributing face masks to its citizens, the WHO was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ded_AxFfJoQ">advising</a> the rest of the world that they were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4olt47pr_o">unnecessary</a>—and initially, the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Surgeon General followed its lead.</p><p>But health experts pointed to mounting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30229968/?from_term=Myers+M&amp;from_cauthor_id=30229968&amp;from_pos=1%20%20https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic">evidence</a> that masks<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30229968/?from_term=Myers+M&amp;from_cauthor_id=30229968&amp;from_pos=1%20%20https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic"> can</a> help slow the spread of respiratory disease, especially among asymptomatic carriers, a population that the WHO maintains is <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak">virtually nonexisten</a>t despite mounting evidence <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html">to the contrary.</a></p><p>In mid-February, the WHO trumpeted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g07zT3ZTFs">good news</a> from  China, claiming confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 had declined, ignoring evidence that it may have been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cases.html">statistical anomaly</a>. U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=politics&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">believes</a> that China has entirely misrepresented both case numbers and death tolls, according to Bloomberg News.</p><p>Finally on March 11, after Italy was already in full national lockdown <a href="https://www.axios.com/italy-coronavirus-timeline-lockdown-deaths-cases-2adb0fc7-6ab5-4b7c-9a55-bc6897494dc6.html">with more than 10,000 cases</a>, the WHO finally acknowledged the true magnitude of the crisis, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPWngYf2Wk">declaring</a> a global pandemic.</p><p>As the death toll <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-deaths-covid-19">climbs above 100,000</a>, the global economy remains in crisis, and billions of lives are disrupted, it's important to remember that if the World Health Organization had done its job, the nightmare we're living through might not have happened at all.</p><p><em>Produced by Zach Weissmueller.

Of COURSE it PRAISED them AFTER it was more OPEN.</p><p>Would you have it say:</p><p>&#8220;CHINA KEPT SECRETS, ENDANGERED LIVES!&#8221;<br /> WHO</p><p>Reason dictates that its best for all of us if international organizations are on the ground in dictatorships as well as democracies.</p><p>Remember WHO didn&#8217;t LIE. WHO passed on information from the source it had to rely on, CHINA. Just as in most nations.</p><p>As to: &#8220;the WHO recommended &#8220;no interference with international travel.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s right. Meta analyses from 2014 published by WHO before the Crona Virus recommended, based on evidence, that international travel travel restrictions NOT be employed. There were deemed ineffective at stopping a virus, and would interfere in international mitigation efforts.</p><p>&#8220;One country that ignored this advice was Taiwan&#8221;</p><p>But you assume it avoided a problem because of the travel restrictions, not because of all the other things that it did (widespread EARLY testing) that WE did not do. In any event, it doesn&#8217;t negate that WHO&#8217;s advice on travel restrictions was based on data and evidence, not politics.</p><p>China refuses to acknowledge Taiwan&#8217;s independence.</p><p>That has nothing to do with a Virus. Its a political dispute.</p><p>Some thoughts.</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-3 parent " id="comment-8211863" data-sort-time="1586991070"><div id="div-comment-8211863" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Valkanis</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8211863">April.15.2020 at 6:51 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>With all due respect, the Chinese government is the most evil in the history of the world.

Machine never funded or built.</p><p>January-August 2019: Trump administration runs a pandemic wargame called “Crimson Contagion” — modeling the outbreak of an uncontrolled flu pandemic, originating in China.</p><p>July 2019: CDC epidemiologist position embedded in the Chinese health authority quits, as Trump administration announces it will eliminate the post amid trade war. Move comes as part of a hollowing out of the CDC’s China presence — from 47 staffers at end of Obama era to barely a dozen.</p><p>FEMA’s National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment for 2019 warns of pandemic risk, modeling an influenza outbreak that leads to “a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, beds, and healthcare workers as hospitals are quickly overwhelmed.”</p><p>August 2019: Contract dispute leaves federal stockpile of ventilators without maintenance, starting in late August through January. When this equipment is later distributed, many ventilators are broken.</p><p>September 2019: Trump administration ends funding for PREDICT — a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiative to support laboratories abroad, including one in Wuhan, China, to be vigilant for viruses with pandemic potential.</p><p>October 2019: Confidential HHS draft report on Crimson Contagion documents failure: “Currently, there are insufficient funding sources designated for the federal Government to use in response to a severe influenza pandemic.” It warns the U.S. “lacks domestic manufacturing capacity for the production of sufficient quantities of personal protective equipment” and that “domestic supplies of on-hand stock of… N95 respirators, ventilators, and other ancillary medical supplies are limited and difficult to restock, because they are often manufactured overseas.”</p><p>November 2019: Secret briefing by U.S. military’s National Center for Medical Intelligence reportedly warns of a new contagion ripping through the Wuhan area of China.</p><p>December 10 2019: First publicly reported case in Wuhan.</p><p>December 30 2019: China announces an investigation of dozens of cases.</p><p>January 3: CDC and Chinese CDC being talks.</p><p>January 7: Chinese scientists identify the novel coronavirus.</p><p>January 8: CDC alerts doctors to be vigilant for patients who have traveled in Wuhan showing respiratory symptoms.</p><p>January 15: First tentative publicly reported U.S. case in Seattle area</p><p>January 16: German scientists propose a test for coronavirus that the WHO adopts, but the U.S. does not.</p><p>January 17: CDC begins public health entry screening at select international airports and reassures the public that &#8220;The risk from 2019-nCoV to the public is currently deemed to be low.&#8221;</p><p>January 18: HHS Secretary Azar, who had been alerted to the outbreak at the beginning of January, finally reaches Trump to talk about coronavirus. The president wants to talk about political fallout from administration’s flavored vape ban.</p><p>January 21: Seattle area case confirmed.</p><p>January 22: Asked if administration has “a plan to contain the coronavirus in the U.S.,” Trump replies: “We do have a plan, and we think it’s going to be handled very well. We’ve already handled it very well. CDC has been terrific. Very great professionals. And we’re in very good shape.”</p><p>CDC announces its own coronavirus test. Informs the public: “Currently, testing must take place at CDC.”</p><p>Trump praises Chinese response to the coronavirus on Twitter. &#8220;China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!&#8221;</p><p>January 22: In interview from Davos, Trump asked: “Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?” Trump replies: “No, not it all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”</p><p>January 26: CDC ups confirmed case count to 5. Sen Schumer calls for emergency declaration.</p><p>January 27: White House Domestic Policy Council chief Joe Grogan reportedly warns chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that failing to get a handle on coronavirus could cost Trump reelection.</p><p>Trump again praises Chinese response on Twitter: &#8220;We are in very close communication with China concerning the virus. Very few cases reported in USA, but strongly on watch. We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary!&#8221;</p><p>January 28: CDC discourages nonessential travel to China.</p><p>January 29: Memo from trade adviser Peter Navarro to National Security Council warns America would be “defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil” raising alarm about “a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.”</p><p>Nearly 200 Americans repatriated from Wuhan to California air base.</p><p>Trump creates Coronavirus Task Force, headed by Azar.</p><p>January 30: WHO declares world health emergency. CDC confirms person-to-person spread. Redfield says: “We still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low.”</p><p>Trump tells America: “We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment.”</p><p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says coronavirus outbreak in China could be an economic boon: “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.”</p><p>Azar reportedly calls Trump to warn him of a possible pandemic. Trump downplays the threat, responding that “Azar was being alarmist,” according to the New York Times.</p><p>January 31: Trump shuts down travel of foreign nationals who’ve been in China, two weeks after travelers stricken with the virus appear to have already spread it in the U.S. An estimated 300,000 people have arrived from China in the previous month.</p><p>Azar declares public health emergency.</p><p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci warns of asymptomatic spread: “In the beginning…it was not clear whether an asymptomatic person could transmit it to someone while they were asymptomatic. Now we know… that that is absolutely the case.”</p><p>February 3: U.S. Army estimates coronavirus could kill as many as 150,000 Americans in a worst-case scenario.</p><p>February 4: FDA approves coronavirus test, but only CDC is authorized to run tests, creating rationing and delays. In State of the Union address, Trump says: “My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.”</p><p>February 5: Flights of other American Wuhan travelers land at air bases in Sacramento, San Diego, San Antonio and Nebraska.</p><p>Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan after coronavirus outbreak on ship.</p><p>Azar asks Office of Management and Budget for $2 billion to replenish national stockpile with respirator masks and other supplies. White House will cut the request to $500 million.</p><p>Following administration briefing on covid, Sen Murphy tweets: &#8220;Just left the Administration briefing on Coronavirus. Bottom line: they aren&#8217;t taking this seriously enough.</p><p>Notably, no request for ANY emergency funding, which is a big mistake. Local health systems need supplies, training, screening staff etc. And they need it now.&#8221;</p><p>February 6: WHO sends 250,000 tests to 159 labs across the world.</p><p>CDC starts shipping coronavirus test kits to “select” laboratories.</p><p>February 7: Trump again praises Chinese response and says the virus will go away when it gets warm: &#8220;Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but&#8230;<br /> &#8230;.he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm &amp; the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!&#8221;</p><p>February 10: Trump downplays threat to U.S.: “The virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in.”</p><p>Trump White House unveils 2021 budget request, including an $85 million cut (13 percent) for the CDC’s Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases program, and a $25 million cut (3 percent) to its Public Health Preparedness and Response.</p><p>Seattle Flu Study appeals to CDC for permission to test existing flu swabs for coronavirus. Request gets tangled in CDC and FDA red tape.</p><p>February 12: CDC announces problems with coronavirus test accuracy.</p><p>February 14: Trump touts poll numbers: “And 61 percent of the voters approve of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus… Now everyone is saying we did a good job.”</p><p>CDC announces it will use flu surveillance network to keep an eye out for coronavirus spread; the project will be “delayed for weeks.”</p><p>National Security Council memo, “U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,” reportedly outlines a potential, federal social distancing response, including “limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone.” The memo also contemplates school closures and “widespread ‘stay at home’ directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.”</p><p>February 21: Coronavirus Task Force reportedly reviews a proposal by Dr. Robert Kadlec, a top HHS doctor who had overseen the Crimson Contagion exercise, for social distancing to lock down of the U.S. economy. Attended by Redfield, Azar and Fauci, the group “concluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing, even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation’s economy,” according to the New York Times.</p><p>Messonnier insists centralized CDC testing is adequate: “We’re fully stood up at CDC. There is no lag time for testing at this point. That is the focus of testing in the United States, the testing here at CDC.”</p><p>February 23: Second Navarro memo to the NSC flags “increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls.”</p><p>February 24: Trump seeks $1.25 billion in covid response funding, and tweets: &#8220;The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health have been working hard and very smart.

Trump is traveling in India, delaying plan.</p><p>February 25: Trump’s Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow: “We have contained this. I won’t say ‘airtight,’ but pretty close to airtight.”</p><p>Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany tells FoxNews: “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here… and isn’t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama.”</p><p>Trump drags Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Twitter for calling for more coronavirus funding: &#8220;Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn’t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Helen Chu of the Seattle Flu Study reportedly begins testing collected flu samples for COVID-19, despite lack of federal authorization.</p><p>CDC’s Messonnier changes tone: “We expect we will see community spread in this country. It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.” Warns of school closures, “missed work and loss of income” and that “disruption to everyday life may be severe.”</p><p>February 26: Trump reportedly calls Azar, enraged, complaining Messonnier was unnecessarily scaring the markets. Plans to brief Trump on need for social distancing measures scrapped.</p><p>At press conference, Trump announces he’s ousted Azar as head of Coronavirus Task Force: “I’m going to be putting our Vice President, Mike Pence, in charge.” Trump downplays seriousness of COVID-19, “This is a flu. This is like a flu.” Adds: “We have a total of 15 [diagnosed] people, and they’re in a process of recovering… In a couple of days we’re going to be down to close to zero. We’re going down, not up. We’re going substantially down.”</p><p>President defends cuts to public health bureaucracy: “Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we have a need, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”</p><p>First confirmed case of community spread as a Californian with no travel history or known contact with other patients becomes ill.</p><p>February 27: All coronavirus messaging is now to be steered through Pence’s office.</p><p>Sen Burr tells a private audience in Washington: “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history. It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”</p><p>Trump: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”</p><p>Redfield says in House testimony government will roll out coronavirus surveillance, like flu surveillance, over the next six to eight weeks.</p><p>February 28: February 28</p><p>White House chief of staff Mulvaney tells attendees of CPAC: “The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is what’s going to bring down the president. That’s what this is all about. This is something we know how to deal with. We are the best country in the world prepared to do this. We have been preparing for this for years. We know how to handle this…. We’re ahead of the curve already.”</p><p>Azar: “Thanks to the President’s historically aggressive containment efforts… everyday Americans don’t need to be worried.”</p><p>Trump: “We’ve done a great job. The press won’t give us credit for it.”</p><p>Community spread discovered in Washington, Oregon, as well as a second case in California. At rally Trump claims criticism of his coronavirus response is nonsense and says: “This is their new hoax.”</p><p>February 29: First U.S. death.</p><p>Redfield: “The risk at this time is low.

Not great by any means, but not terrible either.</p><p>In the end, there is a lot of blame and reassessment to go around.

The idea is to use it to argue that President Trump was responsible for people dying from the virus, an especially nasty and unethical accusation because it is both unproveable and impossible to refute. The quote used to fabricate this lie itself rebuts it: the President called the effort to politicize the pandemic and use it to justify yet another false allegation of malfeasance a hoax, which it is. In fact, this Big Lie is part of that hoax.</p></blockquote></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div></li></ol></li></ol></li><li class="comment byuser even depth-4" id="comment-8211999" data-sort-time="1586996140"><div id="div-comment-8211999" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Sevo</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8211999">April.15.2020 at 8:15 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;Notice how none of the the Trumpfans responded to this devastating, fact-based takedown of their nonsense?&#8221;</p><p>See below for an answer to a pile of shit, lies and unsupported claims</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div></li></ol></li><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-3 parent " id="comment-8211998" data-sort-time="1586996074"><div id="div-comment-8211998" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Sevo</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8211998">April.15.2020 at 8:14 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>Let&#8217;s start at the top of this steaming pile of shit:</p><p>&#8220;March 2017: New Trump administration — focusing DHS on immigration — shuts down department’s modeling of flu pandemics.&#8221;<br /> No cite, a claim that focusing DHS on immigration is some idiot&#8217;s guess:<br /> Verdict BULLSHIT!</p><p>&#8220;May 2017: Trump administration disbands pandemic response team in White House — “no senior administration official is now focused solely on global health security,” Washington Post reports.&#8221;<br /> Cite hinted at, source usually full of shit, anonymous.<br /> Verdict: BULLSHIT.</p><p>&#8220;September 2017: Trump administration presented with the Obama-ordered plans for machine able to make 1.5 million N95 respirator masks a day during a pandemic.

The Trump supporters in this comment section also prove that. Now, with that said, you should never assume that just because someone is a Trump supporter, that means he or she is a racist.

One grievance hurts someone&#8217;s feelings while another can rob someone of a lifetime of lost earnings. In addition in the first instance, as the offended party you have something you can do in return, maybe say something back to them, cease talking to them, call out their insensitivity among a peer group they care about.

Why have they not received updated information from whatever temp is running the CDC?</p><p><i>Naming Influenza Viruses<br /> CDC follows an internationally accepted naming convention for influenza viruses. This convention was accepted by WHO in 1979 and published in February 1980 in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 58(4):585-591 (1980) (see A revision of the system of nomenclature for influenza viruses: a WHO Memorandum pdf icon[854 KB, 7 pages]external icon). The approach uses the following components:</p><p>The antigenic type (e.g., A, B, C, D)<br /> The host of origin (e.g., swine, equine, chicken, etc.). For human-origin viruses, no host of origin designation is given. Note the following examples:<br /> (Duck example): avian influenza A(H1N1), A/duck/Alberta/35/76<br /> (Human example): seasonal influenza A(H3N2), A/Perth/16/2019<br /> Geographical origin (e.g., Denver, Taiwan, etc.)<br /> Strain number (e.g., 7, 15, etc.)<br /> Year of collection (e.g., 57, 2009, etc.)<br /> For influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigen description are provided in parentheses (e.g., influenza A(H1N1) virus, influenza A(H5N1) virus)<br /> The 2009 pandemic virus was assigned a distinct name: A(H1N1)pdm09 to distinguish it from the seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses that circulated prior to the pandemic.<br /> When humans are infected with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine (pigs), these viruses are call variant viruses and are designated with a letter ‘v’ (e.g., an A(H3N2)v virus).</i></p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-5 parent " id="comment-8211518" data-sort-time="1586980787"><div id="div-comment-8211518" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Rufus The Monocled</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8211518">April.15.2020 at 3:59 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>There are a bunch of stains named after the region.</p><p>And your 1850 clam is bull shit.</p><p>If you argued in good faith and not like a passive aggressive twit, maybe it would be productive but you&#8217;re the one that acts like a complete disingenuous fool.</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser even depth-6 parent " id="comment-8211549" data-sort-time="1586981569"><div id="div-comment-8211549" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>American Socialist</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8211549">April.15.2020 at 4:12 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>Passive aggressive?

I think some hashish dealers down by the river side. Not many Tibetans in Wuhan, either. Check the market places, and you might find them where dubious medicines are sold. Powdered deer horn and the like.</p><p>Uighurs are Muslims. Confucianism isn&#8217;t a big part of their lives. Communist apparatchiks are atheists, Confucianism is not a big part of their lives, either. Its emphasis is on loyalty to family and state, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why typical Chinese put so much stock in having an elder son to pass on the family name and family responsibilities &#8211; maintaining ancestor&#8217;s graves etc. Islam is about worshipping god, communism, worship of the state.</p><p>Christianity, Islam, and Communism are not deeply held beliefs of the Chinese people. For that, look to Confucianism and the writings in the I Ching, the book of changes. These inform all aspects of life and thought in China, from how to prepare a meal (ie the correct way to harmoniously mix the five spices in accordance with your particular health needs) to your obligations to family and nation.</p><p>Koreans are more likely to follow neo confucianism, a variation dating back some 500 years, but it&#8217;s very similar, especially from a Western perspective. Followers of confucianism or neo confucianism are more inclined to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the nation than Liberals in the west who put more stock in individual autonomy and independence. That&#8217;s what makes the Asian response to the pandemic more effective than that of the US, I believe.</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div><ol class="children"><li class="comment byuser even depth-6 parent " id="comment-8212263" data-sort-time="1587007744"><div id="div-comment-8212263" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>VenerableLurker</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8212263">April.15.2020 at 11:29 pm </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>I should have been more clear.

It&#8217;s enough of a difference to make it possible for a Taiwanese business person to open a factory on the mainland, but prevent the same business person from marching into an olympic stadium under a flag the communists disapprove of.</p></div><div class="reply"></div></div></li></ol></li><li class="comment byuser even depth-9" id="comment-8212294" data-sort-time="1587009630"><div id="div-comment-8212294" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Sevo</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8212294">April.16.2020 at 12:00 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;It’s informal, I assure you.&#8221;<br /> You.<br /> Are.<br /> Full.<br /> Of.<br /> Shit.<br /> I assure you.</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser odd alt depth-9" id="comment-8212324" data-sort-time="1587011636"><div id="div-comment-8212324" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>Sevo</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8212324">April.16.2020 at 12:33 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;It’s informal, I assure you.

It doesn&#8217;t surprise me at all, incentives motivating local bureaucrats and party hacks being what they are. What is pleasantly surprising is the speed and seriousness of the Wuhan response compared with the abysmal handing of the SARS virus a few years back. That is a story that should make your hair stand on end. Are you familiar with the details? Check out Philip Pan&#8217;s &#8216;Out of Mao&#8217;s Shadow&#8217; if you think you have the stomach for it. Most of it is about the Cultural Revolution and the One Child policy, but the bits about SARS, near the end of the book should turn your hair gray.

China has spent billions in Ethiopia, Tedros’s home country, leaving Tedros the perfect WHO candidate since he was beholden to Beijing. Xi’s wife Peng Liyuan served as a WHO goodwill ambassador for many years before Tedros landed the job. Repaying Xi was never in questions for Tedros, who’s confidence kept the U.S. and other U.N. member-states from knowing the extent to the Wuhan epidemic. By the time the truth came out March 11, it was already too late with millions of infected Chinese tourists descending on Europe, United States and beyond.. It’s no accident that Europe and the United States have borne the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Timelines suggesting American knowledge of the potential health implications of the virus being first noted in December 2019 do exist. Certainly, the epidemiology research community had previously developed guidelines for how to address infections of this potential. Responses in the US were slower than ideal based on the established scientific literature, and some news outlets referred to the notions that such a crisis might develop as hoaxes, or weak alternatives to impeachment of the President. It seems one must choose which renditions they prefer, and then realize that “all roads lead to Rome”. We have substantial issues to resolve including the balance of economic and human capital, and the creation of both vaccines and treatments for a potentially lethal phenomenon no one clearly understood until responses were limited. In the meantime, the rate of infection or death has not been correlated with political affiliation.</p></div><div class="reply"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-login" href="https://reason.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Freason.com%2Fvideo%2Fhow-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19%2F">Log in to Reply <i class="fas fa-reply"></i></a></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-8212383" data-sort-time="1587020988"><div id="div-comment-8212383" class="comment-body"><div class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><strong>JoshuaH</strong></cite></div> <a href="https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/#comment-8212383">April.16.2020 at 3:09 am </a></div><div class="comment-content"><p>Every country needs to follow in line and pull out of China and then see how powerful they are.
