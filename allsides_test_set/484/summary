Trump announced a European travel ban earlier in March and followed up on that by declaring a national emergency as well.
The day the Trump administration announced the China travel restrictions, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused him of “hysterical xenophobia.” Major news outlets were also harshly critical of Trump’s decision.
In recent weeks, U.S. officials have repeatedly condemned China for putting out misleading information about the coronavirus outbreak and spreading falsehoods about the infection in recent weeks.
"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus," Trump tweeted in late January.
Critics argue the terminology is racist and xenophobic, though dozens of media outlets and news shows repeatedly referred to the COVID-19 virus as some variant of the “Chinese coronavirus” or “Wuhan coronavirus” for weeks.
