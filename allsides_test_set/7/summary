The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is finally forcing a conversation about our vast economic entanglements with communist China.
While we’re reevaluating those ties, celebrities are flocking to TikTok and raising money for the China-complicit World Health Organization.
Lady Gaga is helping organize a major star-studded special on April 18, set to air across CBS, ABC, and NBC.
It’s also funding and legitimizing the WHO, which has defended the Chinese Communist Party’s reprehensible response to the outbreak.
To be perfectly clear, I’m sure their efforts will be of great benefit to the brave health-care workers who need resources right now.
