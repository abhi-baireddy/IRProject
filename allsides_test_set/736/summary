President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign sent out an email asking for donations to fight the coronavirus.
The email asked supporters to make a campaign contribution as the president oversaw efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak that has already claimed more than 9,500 lives.
“It’s no secret that our Nation was hit with a huge unforeseen challenge,” the email reads.
“While I’m fighting for the safety of our Nation and its citizens,” the email continues, “I need to know that you are fighting for me too.”The re-election campaign promised a personalized gold card to supporters who made contributions.
