Federal prosecutors detailed the alleged foreign lobbying schemes carried out by Imaad Zuberi in a lengthy memo on Tuesday, alleging the Southern California campaign fundraiser who donated to Democrats and Republicans concealed work for shadowy interests around the world.
The Justice Department said Zuberi repeatedly violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act in receiving millions of dollars from foreign actors and lobbying Congress on their behalf.
The offenses involved prohibited activities on behalf of numerous foreign governments, entities, and individuals that transpired over the course of several years.
The violations were part of a larger surreptitious effort to route foreign money into U.S. elections and to use it to corrupt U.S. policy-making processes,” prosecutors said.
For years, Zuberi donated mostly to Democrats before throwing large sums at President Trump’s inaugural committee after his win in 2016.
