The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time.
The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1, but decided to put off the challenges for now.
“The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release.
The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic.
The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever.
