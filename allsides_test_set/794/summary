The White House released a list of senators invited to be on the president's task force focused on re-opening America during the coronavirus pandemic.
The only Republican senator not invited to be on the task force was Mitt Romney, one of Trump's most outspoken critics in his own party.
President Donald Trump seemed to continue his feud with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on Thursday by leaving him off the list of invitees to a new coronavirus task force.
A spokesperson for Romney confirmed to The Hill that he was not asked to take part in the task force.
Trump and Romney have a bitter history, dating back to when Trump was first running for president in 2016.
