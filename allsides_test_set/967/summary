Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the committee, and top Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia unveiled the energy bill Thursday, and they are fast-tracking the bill.
Many of the bipartisan measures included in the broader package have been touted by Republicans as part of their energy innovation agenda, which has become central to the party’s developing response to climate change.
"This clean energy innovation bill is a monumental move toward decarbonizing our economy," said Rich Powell, executive director of ClearPath Action, a conservative clean energy group.
That framing, however, could make the bill a challenging pill to swallow for liberal Democrats who say those measures aren’t nearly sufficient enough to address rising greenhouse gas emissions.
Democrats more broadly may have some concerns with portions of the energy bill too.
