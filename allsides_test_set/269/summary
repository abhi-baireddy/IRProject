As part of the sweeping actions announced by the Trump administration, the State Department designated Maduro and top current and former officials from Venezuela's military, parliament and judiciary under its Narcotics Rewards Program, offering multimillion-dollar bounties.
However the State Department, which would officially make a terrorism designation, said Thursday it would not be doing that.
Instead, the State Department used another law aimed at sanctioning international traffickers and narco-terrorists.
Senior Venezuelan officials charged by US prosecutors in the past with drug trafficking have sought to portray the US as meddling imperialists.
An official from the State Department, which makes the designation, said that was incorrect.
