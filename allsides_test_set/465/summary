A top Environmental Protection Agency official who had led the agency’s weakening of Obama-era climate change rules is resigning.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced Wednesday the departure of Assistant Administrator Bill Wehrum, the chief of the agency’s Office of Air and Radiation.
Wehrum had been facing scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups for his past ties to the industry, considering his role in drafting business-friendly regulations.
Wehrum spearheaded the EPA’s rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that was meant to regulate carbon emissions of coal plants.
Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA’s history," John Walke, clean air director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the Washington Examiner.
