Wednesday marks the official census day, but thatâ€™s not the day the census forms are due (the count continues for several months).
The U.S. Constitution mandates a census every 10 years to provide the population statistics for reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
House districts remained as they were until after the 1930 census, which came as the nation was sliding into the Great Depression.
But much like the social distancing required to stem the pandemic, that only works if people submit their census answers as they are asked to.
Even before the virus hit, California was one of 10 states at risk of losing House seats in the next reapportionment.
