The State of Georgia plans to execute Ray Jefferson Cromartie, 52, at the end of the month.
DNA evidence might prove that another man pulled the trigger, but the authorities have refused to do the tests to find out.
Under State Code 16-2-20, Georgia still considers him responsible for the murder, even if he didn't actually fire the shot.
"Forensic DNA testing is essential to the pursuit of the truth and justice and to prevent the potential execution of an innocent man," he told the Times-Enterprise.
We will appeal to other decision-makers to continue to seek DNA testing in order to get these vital questions answered before it's too late."
