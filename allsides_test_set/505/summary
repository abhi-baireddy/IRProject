Under the $2.2 trillion federal CARES Act, self-employed workers and contract employees will now be able to access unemployment benefits.
“People should definitely log their claims so they can receive retroactive benefits,” said Michael Finer, CEO of Finer Wealth Management.
“If you don’t log your claim, you may not receive benefits.”People can apply for unemployment benefits through the state’s website, Mass.gov.
The CARES Act adds 13 weeks of benefits to the traditional 26 weeks, plus an extra $600 a week in federal benefits for up to four months.
Officials are asking those who are self-employed to wait to file until the state gets more guidance on how to process their claims.
