But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have primary responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump would not offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, which he claimed, despite constitutional limitations, was absolute.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at the White House. “The governors know that.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The comments came not long after Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More on the virus</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/f68fa688b76c2853d22a3c765042f066">– <!-- -->Virus cases about 2M worldwide; few new hot spots</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/5a254712e24f7a5b3e3bdd2a2c726c25">– <!-- -->Virus-era decisions: Way too many, and each with high stakes</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-83"><a class="link-0-2-84" href="/ec487fbe276f9891bb3d57a09c35a0c8">– <!-- -->AP PHOTOS: Ghostly virus-era NYC, captured from a motorbike</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump has been discussing with senior aides how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing non-essential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend into the early summer.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">And governors made clear Monday they wouldn’t tolerate pressure to act before they deem it safe.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Meanwhile, governors were banding together, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, stressed the efforts would take time.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The house is still on fire,” Murphy said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump, however, insisted it was his decision to make.</p><div id="afs:Content:8774580256" data-key="hub-link-embed" class="Component-hubLink-0-2-76"><span class="title-0-2-86">Full Coverage:<!-- --> </span><a class="link-0-2-87 overrideArticle" href="/tag/VirusOutbreak">Virus Outbreak</a></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The president of the United States calls the shots,” he said, promising to release a paper outlining his legal argument. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Though Trump abandoned his goal of beginning to roll back social distancing guidelines by Easter, he has been itching to reboot an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was <a class="" href="/6a8f85aad99607f313cca6ab1398e04d">slow to respond to the virus </a><!-- --> and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, who told CNN on Sunday that, “obviously,” had the country “started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Mulvihill reported from New Jersey.

But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have primary responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it's safe to begin a return to normal operations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump would not offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, which he claimed, despite constitutional limitations, was absolute.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at the White House. “The governors know that.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The comments came not long after Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"5414f780-6ae0-11ea-a794-a576215db1b2\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump has been discussing with senior aides how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing non-essential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend into the early summer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And governors made clear Monday they wouldn’t tolerate pressure to act before they deem it safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, governors were banding together, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, stressed the efforts would take time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The house is still on fire,” Murphy said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump, however, insisted it was his decision to make.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8774580256\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The president of the United States calls the shots,\" he said, promising to release a paper outlining his legal argument. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Trump abandoned his goal of beginning to roll back social distancing guidelines by Easter, he has been itching to reboot an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump's reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort\" between Washington and the states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Talk about how and when to reboot the nation's economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/6a8f85aad99607f313cca6ab1398e04d\">slow to respond to the virus \u003c/a> and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, who told CNN on Sunday that, “obviously,\" had the country \"started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,\" raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci's job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci's positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mulvihill reported from New Jersey.

The site was later adjusted to reflect nearly 582,000 cases in the U.S. and 1.9 million cases worldwide. It was not immediately clear why the numbers changed.

There's also concern about Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>China, where the pandemic began, reported 89 new virus cases on Tuesday, 86 of them among travelers arriving from abroad, but no new deaths.

In early March, the country was reporting about 500 new cases per day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hot spots may yet emerge as states lift stay-at-home orders, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington institute that created widely cited projections of virus-related deaths. He pointed to states where the number of COVID-19 cases is still climbing: Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Don’t consider relaxing social distancing in the near term,” Murray said he’d advise leaders in those states. “You need to stay the course.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>To date, some U.S. infections have taken off like sparks starting fires, while others have sputtered out. Trevor Bedford, whose lab at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has been tracking the pandemic using the virus’s genetic code, acknowledges it’s a “dice roll” that makes it hard to predict hot spots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And when restrictions are eased, people will not immediately dive back into their social connections, at least not without precautions, Bedford said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, relying on data from mobile devices in New Orleans, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, suggested that social-distancing policies prompted more people to stay at home in March and might have curbed spread of the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The report “provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVD-19,” the authors said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The infection rate remains relatively low in areas of the developing world that have poor or nonexistent health care infrastructure. The rapid spread of the coronavirus beyond cities to more rural areas often depends on travel and social connections, said Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But he noted that rural areas often have less sophisticated health surveillance systems to pick up potential disease clusters, prompting the question, “Is it that it’s not there or is it that we’re not detecting the disease when it is there?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In some European countries, officials pointed to positive signs as they began prepping for the reopening of largely shuttered economies and industries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italian authorities announced on Monday that there were 3,153 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, approximately a 1.9 percent increase. That brings the country’s overall toll of known cases to nearly 160,000. The day-to-day death toll, 566, however, was up, from the 431 new deaths registered on Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy's day-to-day increase in infections was one of the lowest in weeks, bolstering a generally downward trend. Slightly eased restrictions were about to take effect in some sectors of the country, such as allowing stores selling necessities for newborns to reopen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In hard-hit Spain, workers were permitted to return to some factory and construction jobs as the government looked to restart manufacturing. Retail stores and services were still required to stay closed, and the government required office workers to keep working from home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some health experts and politicians argue that it’s premature to ease the lockdown in a nation that has suffered more than 17,750 deaths and reported more than 170,000 infections, second only to the United States’ 581,670 cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health Minister Salvador Illa said Monday that he would proceed with “the utmost caution and prudence ... and always based on scientific evidence.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se3:9097a320-6ae0-11ea-872a-9361ef509eb3\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-PhVF0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PhVF0/2/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"Europe choropleth map Coronavirus spread through Europe\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Parra reported from Madrid.

If you struggled financially, it meant making rolling decisions about which groceries were affordable and which stayed on the shelf. For others, it was selecting channels and streaming services and apps. Choosing tech. Swiping Tinder. Navigating, say, the average New Jersey diner menu, which hovers around at 150 items. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yes, if you bought the MacBook Air instead of the MacBook Pro, you’d have portability but a smaller screen and weaker processor. Yes, buying the Oikos Greek Blueberry Blended Yogurt might make your mouth happier than the regular Dannon with the fruit on the bottom. First-world problems, mostly. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The thing about those tiny decisions, though, was that we didn’t HAVE to make many of them. And if we screwed up, the stakes were often low. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, though, the problems around tiny decisions are not first-world but worldwide. The most fleeting of daily choices — no matter where you are — have taken on the most monumental of potential consequences.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8772270572\">More coverage: Life\u003c/div>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://katboogaard.com/\">Kat Boogaard\u003c/a>, a Wisconsin freelancer who has written about decision fatigue, grapples with this.

But that’s offset by the fraughtness of other once-routine decisions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:739167e0-6ae0-11ea-da48-373f1c4c20dc\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"China's COVID-19 cases have notably plateaued according to reports, leveling off the ascent since mid-February. \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-dDzn8\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dDzn8/17/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"Interactive line chart Flattening the coronavirus curve\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I never thought I’d agonize over the perfect time to grab groceries or whether I should visit my OBGYN,” says Boogaard, who is 35 weeks pregnant. “It increases my anxiety, hinders my focus and has had a negative impact on my productivity.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For many right now, duress is a daily companion that wears countless coats. And as social scientists will tell you, an agitated state is not the best moment to decide things — particularly momentous ones. “We seem to do our best thinking when we’re feeling good,” psychologist Barry Schwartz wrote in his 2004 book, “ \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/149151423X\">The Paradox of Choice\u003c/a>.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What we’re up against in this kind of situation is our long-ingrained habits,” says \u003ca href=\"https://directory.qu.edu/Profile/14224\">Carrie Bulger\u003c/a>, a psychology professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut who teaches decision fatigue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Picture this, she says: You decide to go to the grocery store. You see strawberries. Are they bruised? Normally you’d pick them up and check for freshness. Not now. So you move through the supermarket landscape hyperaware of decisions — from social distancing to choosing a cut of meat — and walk out to the parking lot exhausted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re up against decisions that never even crossed our minds before,” Bulger says. “You wonder what norms and rules you might have violated along the way from aisle one to aisle 14.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.” — Malcolm Gladwell, “ \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669\">Blink\u003c/a> ” (2005)\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s another problem.

Just the notion of whether to wear a mask has evolved — a choice laden not only with self-preservation but even morality.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the past, you could say, `I’m a good person, I donate to charity, I am nice to the persons around me, I don’t kick dogs,’” Wong says. “Now people have to ask themselves: Does it make me a bad person if I go to the store to buy a bag of chips? That’s very heavy, and in many ways it’s new to the American consciousness.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In NBC’s philosophical comedy “ \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place\">The Good Place\u003c/a>,” a moment comes when the main characters come to a realization: Being “good” has become impossible because life has grown so intricate that even good decisions can, somewhere downstream, cause something bad.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps even more relevant right now would be this scenario, unfathomable to Americans four weeks ago: a world where miniature decisions have multiplied and increased in gravity to the point where a paralysis of choice might seem — to many — a reasonable alternative.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Maybe it’s useful that so many of us are locked down right now.

Lower Manhattan to Harlem. Red Hook to Elmhurst. Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx: on avenues and on side streets, over bridges and across parkways and expressways.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marti chose the routes as they went, using his photographer’s eye to make driving choices, sometimes listening to the unforgettable New York music of Lou Reed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wong, perched on the back, worked fast with an eye honed in places from Myanmar to North Korea, choosing her moments to illustrate the life of a city on pause. Sometimes they were so in sync, so wrapped in this strange world, that he would pause and point, and she would have already seen the shot and raised her lens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In many of these images, the people are what's missing. They are not where they should be. In others, a few tread where throngs usually walk, an unsettling sight in itself. Wong and Marti captured restaurants, closed. Taxis lined up, parked and unoccupied. Wide highways, unwelcoming in their emptiness. People, alone where the crowds should be.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The bike — its bumps, its turns, its quickness — made the photography more challenging. Somehow, though, as they suspected, it also pulled out the character of the city in a way that matched this odd moment: a bit crooked, a bit skewed, as if, all at once, it was New York and it wasn’t.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>For those who do not call New York home, the city flashes in and out of consciousness, served up in establishing shots and TV credits. “Taxi.” “The Sopranos.” “Law &amp; Order.” “Sex and the City.” Because of this, most of us — the non-New Yorkers among us — tend to consume the city in quick and fragmented images.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8780120185\">See more of AP's top images Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>What Wong and Marti discovered and corralled is the documentary version of this — the snippets and snatches of a city served up as as it really is right now, constricted and claustrophobic in all its shell-shocked glory. And still, strangely, cinematic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A lone jogger. A tentative street crosser. A man, sitting on an overpass alone. Straight things and square things, served up at oblique angles. Items in the foreground that shouldn’t be there. Other things reaching in from the side. Motorcycle mirrors making cameo appearances to show that these were not moments planned and blocked, but moments snagged before the hibernating city reclaimed them once more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This album — street photography in the metaphorical and literal senses, most of it entirely uncropped — is an album of images, of course. But it is also an album of the senses, of what it feels like to do what most of us cannot and would not: wander the city while it is a ghost and see what we find. “The whole idea,” says Wong, “was to make it a stolen moment.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many of New York’s moments have, in fact, been stolen in these most recent weeks of its life. Pieces of the city have waited for its people to come back before, though never quite like this. And just as before, the city waits for its people. If the past is any indication, they will return.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But not yet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Longtime Associated Press journalist Ted Anthony has worked with Wong and Marti in
