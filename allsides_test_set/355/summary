The lawsuit states, “The Campaign, through counsel, sent a written demand to CNN on February 25, 2020, to retract and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements.
CNN refused.
The lawsuit then clearly accuses CNN of bias, writing: “It is not entirely surprising that CNN would publish such blatantly false statements against the Campaign.
There is extensive evidence that CNN and its writer, Larry Noble, are extremely biased against the Campaign.
The Campaign was damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, in the millions of dollars.”
