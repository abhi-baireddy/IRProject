Dozens of people escape North Korea every year but defections across the DMZ are extremely dangerous and rare.
In November 2017, a North Korean soldier was shot at 40 times by his fellow troops as he crossed the zone.
He was picked up by South Korean troops and taken into military custody.
North Korean state media KCNA said the launches, overseen by Kim Jong-un, were test firings of a "new-type large-calibre multiple launch guided rocket system".
The tests were a "warning" to South Korea over planned military exercises scheduled to take place with the US later this month, North Korea said.
