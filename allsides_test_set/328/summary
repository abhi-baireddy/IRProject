For the past three years, many of the critics calling Trump a racist have repeatedly condemned him of buddying up to authoritarian strongmen such as Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Had Trump been keen to denigrate Chinese people, he would have labeled the virus “Chinese” far earlier.
At a time when Chinese Americans report an uptick in racism prompted by the pandemic, calling the coronavirus Chinese risks maligning U.S. residents of ethnic Chinese descent, not just the Chinese Communist government.
Never mind that many Chinese restaurants across the country, especially those situated in Chinatowns, are patronized most heavily by Chinese customers.
It makes people’s earlier precautions about patronizing Chinese restaurants appear far more sensible.
