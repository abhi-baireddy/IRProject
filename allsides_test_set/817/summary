WASHINGTON â€“ The House of Representatives approved a bill Thursday that attempts to retroactively remove the deadline for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment.
Also, a number of states that did ratify the ERA later rescinded their approval.
The commonwealth's first female speaker of the House ensured the ERA was the first bill to pass out of her chamber.
While Democrats work to revive the amendment, liberal icon, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg says the ERA is dead.
Getting three-fourths of states to ratify it would be a challenge too, but this fight is far from over.
