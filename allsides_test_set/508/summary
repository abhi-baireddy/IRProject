Every few years, America catches a nasty “cold” that afflicts untold damage on its communities and citizenry.
Over the history of our country, we have weathered a number of these sorts of colds, but in every case, it is clear that when America catches a cold, the black community has caught pneumonia.
In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, African Americans make up about half of the county’s 945 confirmed cases but account for 81 percent of the deaths.
In Michigan, which is only 14 percent black, African Americans accounted for 35 percent of the cases and 40 percent of the COVID-19 related deaths.
America has weathered some terrible colds in the past, but sadly, it has been, and it will continue to be, the black community that catches the resulting pneumonia.
