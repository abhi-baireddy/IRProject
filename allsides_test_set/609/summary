The death toll from the coronavirus surged by 50% in Wuhan, China, the city where the health crisis first emerged, after Chinese health authorities announced revised numbers.
The number of deaths increased from 1,290 to 3,869, according to a notice from Wuhan officials published by Chinaâ€™s Xinhua News Agency on Friday.
The new figure puts the death toll in China at 4,632.
The death toll was revised to include people who had died at home and to correct misreporting by hospitals bombarded with patients, Wuhan officials said.
But Beijing has long been accused of underreporting and covering up the number of coronavirus infections and deaths.
