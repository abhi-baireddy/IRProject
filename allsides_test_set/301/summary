Ralph Northam announced Sunday that he signed a series of new measures into law aimed at expanding access to voting in the commonwealth.
The new legislation will establish Election Day as a holiday, remove the requirement that voters show a photo ID prior to casting a ballot and, expand early voting to be allowed 45 days before an election without a stated reason.
Several states and cities have already made Election Day a civic holiday, including Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky and New York.
Proponents say making Election Day a holiday could improve voter turnout.
But Election Day may not become a federal holiday anytime soon -- it's drawn deep division along party lines.
