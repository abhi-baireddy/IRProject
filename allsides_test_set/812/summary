Navy SEALs expressed anguish and anger as they accused Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher of war crimes, The New York Times is reporting.
And Special Operator First Class Craig Miller, one of the most experienced SEALs in the group, told investigators: "The guy is freaking evil."
They were part of Navy investigative materials about the prosecution of Gallagher on war crimes charges, including murder.
"I think Eddie was proud of it, and that was, like, part of it for him," Miller told investigators.
The videos are part of a documentary that will be shown Sunday on The New York Times' show, "The Weekly" on FX.
