#BREAKING | To further increase blood donations safely, @realDonaldTrump's @US_FDA is reducing red tape and easing restrictions on gay men and other people wishing to donate.

This rule will still bar many gay people whose blood is not seriously at risk for HIV contamination, such as monogamous, married gay men.
As Iâ€™ve previously explained , all blood donations are already tested rigorously, such that only 1 in 3.1 million HIV-infected donations will make it through the screening process.
The FDA said it is working on the data, moving toward a system more individual-based that would eventually bring even more prospective gay blood donors into the fold.
