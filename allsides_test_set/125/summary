For example, at Mar-a-Lago, the Secret Service was reportedly charged $650 per night dozens of times in 2017, but was given a different and cheaper rate of $396.15 other times in 2018.
NBC News previously reported, in June of last year, that the Trump International Hotel in Washington charged the Secret Service more than $200,000 in taxpayer money from September 2016 to February 2018.
The Secret Service has failed to list all of the receipts in public databases of federal spending, which is normally required for payments of more than $10,000.
In an interview with Yahoo Finance last year, Trump Organization Executive Vice President Eric Trump said: “If my father travels, they stay at our properties for free...
We do not know how many taxpayer dollars are in his pocket.”In a statement, the Secret Service said its spending “balances operational security with judicious allocation of resources.”
