A State Department report into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server for government business, obtained by Fox News on Friday, found dozens of individuals at fault and hundreds of security violations.
The report reflected only approximately 30,000 emails that the State Department was able to physically review, and found 38 individuals were responsible for 91 violations.
The Clinton email controversy dogged her throughout her failed 2016 presidential bid.
The department received the emails in December 2014, well after Clinton left the department in early 2013.
There was no “persuasive evidence” of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information, according to the report.
