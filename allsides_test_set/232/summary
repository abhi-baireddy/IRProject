The Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, warned the industry is at grave risk due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Solar companies and workers are losing business and being put out of work by COVID-19,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA.
In addition, residents are increasingly cancelling plans to install solar systems, while big box stores curtail or eliminate solar projects.
The $20 billion in investment that was anticipated in 2020 from the solar industry is now under threat, SEIA added.
Since the pandemic will obviously delay many new solar projects, if Congress does not extend those credits, solar firms cannot use them.
