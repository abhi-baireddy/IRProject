The Trump administration is considering the national security implications if China steps in and tries to help the Bahamas rebuild after the destruction left by Hurricane Dorian, Axios is reporting.
China already has invested in ports, railways, power grids, gas pipelines and other infrastructure projects throughout Asia, Europe and Africa.
Now, it has the opportunity to do the same in the Bahamas â€“ just off U.S. waters, Axios noted in a report posted on Thursday.
As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or had suffered severe damage.
And a massive relief effort was underway with volunteers ferrying supplies to the islands in a flotilla of boats.
