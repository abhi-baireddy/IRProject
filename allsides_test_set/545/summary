President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration is looking at ordering airlines to cut back on domestic flights in an effort to quell the spread of the coronavirus between cities already under siege by the pandemic.
But Trump said he isn't ready to issue a national stay-at-home order, saying it isn't needed in some states.

"You have them going, in some cases, from hot spot to hot spot," Trump said about airlines at his daily briefing on the crisis.
