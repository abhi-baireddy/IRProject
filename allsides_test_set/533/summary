“States should be able to make a judgment to legalize marijuana,” Biden said.
Biden’s more conservative approach to the issue runs counter to several 2020 White House rivals who have called to legalize marijuana at the federal level.
New Jersey Senator Cory Booker has even introduced legislation in the Senate that would legalize marijuana nationwide, and would also expunge the records of those convicted of marijuana drug crimes.
Biden’s resistance to get behind federal legalization marks another rift between Biden and the candidates pushing the party further to the left this election cycle.
Biden will be the only candidate on stage who has not expressed support for federal marijuana legalization.
