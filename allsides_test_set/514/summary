As a result, companies like Intuit, whose TurboTax is the top tax prep software, continue to confuse some customers who seek free tax prep into paying.
Today, Google searches for “free tax filing” and other similar phrases still yield ads for a plethora of products such as TurboTax’s “Free Edition” (its ads promise “100% Free Tax Filing”), which lead customers to pay fees if they don’t have simple returns.
So-called organic links to Free Edition appear ahead of links to Free File in many searches, data from SEMRush and Ahrefs shows.
By comparison, Drysdale said, the TurboTax Free File landing page uses “free” 19 times.
But there are many common SEO tactics that TurboTax can use to ensure its Free Edition appears above the Free File program.
