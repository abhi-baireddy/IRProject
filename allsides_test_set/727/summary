According to data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the obesity rate reached 42.4% in 2017-2018 â€“ surpassing 40% for the first time.
While adults across age groups saw similar obesity rates in 2017-2018, there were disparities by race and ethnicity: At 49.6%, the obesity rate was highest among black adults, though it was also above 40% for Hispanics and non-Hispanic white adults.
The obesity rate was lowest among Asians, at 17.4%.
And while men and women saw similar obesity rates, women were significantly more likely to be severely obese than men.
People who are severely obese are at even higher risk of issues like coronary heart disease and end-stage renal disease, the CDC report says.
