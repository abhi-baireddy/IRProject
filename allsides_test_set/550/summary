Now the Tea Party is essentially over, the movement degraded by its own hypocrisy.
Others have brought their energy to the likes of Bernie Sanders or “The Squad.” But the Tea Party is different.
But the same Tea Party that frothed about deficits under President Obama now drools slavishly at the excesses of President Trump.
Or consider the Tea Party opposition to the heavy hand of the federal government, at least when that hand belonged to President Obama.
The Tea Party has hurled its principles off of a cliff.
