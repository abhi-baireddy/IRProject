President Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. is placing a hold on funding to the World Health Organization for 60â€“90 days over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, pending a review.
"The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time, tremendous amounts of time."
A similar approach was adopted in 2017 when the U.S. cut $285 million from its funding to the United Nations.
Trump did not reveal on Tuesday which mechanism he will use to halt funding to the organization.
