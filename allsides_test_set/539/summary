Contractors working for the Trump administration are blowing apart a mountain on protected lands in southern Arizona to make way for the president’s border wall.
One of those burial sites lies just beyond the westward advance of the border wall, Grijalva explained.
The Trump administration has used the act to waive dozens of laws — from the Environmental Protection Act to the Endangered Species Act — in order to push through new border wall construction projects.
Just west of Arizona’s Lukeville port of entry from Mexico is Monument Hill, a rolling mound of earth that is not conducive to the kind of border wall construction that has rapidly unfolded elsewhere in the area.
A former National Park Service employee at Organ Pipe, Jordahl has consistently documented the monument’s destruction.
