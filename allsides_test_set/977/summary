Video Produced by Gaby LevesqueAs more and more U.S. states expand marijuana legalization, and with weed usage on the rise, doctors and advocates are warning about a little-known condition affecting heavy users of the drug.
Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS, causes severe abdominal pain, nausea and “cyclic vomiting” among regular marijuana users — and can lead to extreme dehydration and, in rare cases, death.
“I want to be clear, that doesn’t mean a third of them have that extreme version of CHS,” Habboushe said.
She was diagnosed with CHS and no longer uses marijuana, despite promoting it in her work.
“I want them to be aware of the symptoms.”The same goes for Denney, who wants marijuana to be legalized so that CHS can be studied without stigma.
