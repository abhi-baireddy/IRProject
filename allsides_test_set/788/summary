(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)The U.S. is gaining momentum in our standoffs with China, Iran, and North Korea.
The U.S. is currently engaged in a three-front, maximum-pressure standoff with China, Iran, and North Korea — involving everything from tariffs to possible military action and the strictest sanctions in memory.
North Korea is relatively quiet but likewise is reaching a point of decision.
So it wrongheadedly lifted sanctions and pronounced the “Agreed Framework” a success leading to the denuclearization of North Korea.
As pressure mounts, and the bursting point nears, we should expect North Korea to launch some missile or provoke Japan, South Korea, or U.S. forces in the area.
