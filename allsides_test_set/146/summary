Jerry Falwell, Jr., president of the evangelical Liberty University, has long positioned himself as a torch-bearer of free expression.
"Free speech and intellectual diversity are two of the most important pillars of a college education," he wrote last June.
"That's why I urge every college and university in the country to encourage open political discourse on their own campusesâ€”just as we do at Liberty University."
But it's the height of hypocrisy to muzzle student speech while making a show of opposing censorship.
It's a bad approach for anyone to take, but especially someone who claims to support free expression and intellectual diversity.
