While there is no evidence hackers intercepted or tampered with the results, a security firm consulted by ProPublica found that the app lacks key safeguards.
A glitch in the smartphone app used to count and report votes from individual precincts continues to delay results from Monday’s Iowa caucuses.
The Nevada State Democratic Party, which paid Shadow Inc. $58,000 in August for “technology services,” said it will not employ the app during its Feb. 22 caucuses.
ProPublica obtained a version of the app from an Iowa precinct chair and sent it to Veracode for review this week.
But caucuses are different — and Iowa shows how that can be a problem.
