At the core of the complaint is the tenuous distinction between Bloomberg’s personal finances and those of his presidential campaign.
The complaint alleges that both far exceed FEC limits on campaign contributions.
By deciding to transfer the $18 million to the DNC, Bloomberg reneged on a plan to employ his campaign organizers through November by forming a Super PAC.
"I think if the FEC does not go after Bloomberg, it will open up a huge loophole in the law."
Keeping politics as level a playing field as possible between moneyed interests and voters is a balancing act, one that could be made more difficult for the everyman if Bloomberg’s transfer goes through.
