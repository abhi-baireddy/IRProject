The Seattle City Council took the position Monday that all rent and mortgage payments should be canceled during the novel coronavirus pandemic, passing a resolution calling on Gov.
Councilmember Tammy Morales sponsored the nonbinding resolution, saying many people have lost jobs and have seen their incomes reduced because of the outbreak.
“It’s the end of the month and we’ve got constituents who are worried about being able to make their rent payments,” Morales said.
“We also have landlords who understand their tenants can’t pay rent but still have mortgage payments.”The resolution is a lobbying maneuver; it doesn’t make any changes in law and doesn’t change conditions on the ground in Seattle.
The council didn’t discuss legal and constitutional issues related to the concept of a moratorium on housing payments.
