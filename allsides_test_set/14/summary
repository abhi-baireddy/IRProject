A student's plans to attend Harvard University were potentially cut short Friday when a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer at Boston Logan International Airport turned him away.
She said that she found people posting political points of view that oppose the US on my friend[s] list," Ajjawi wrote, according to the Crimson.
Ajjawi told the paper he has "no single post on my timeline discussing politics."
In a statement to CBS News, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that Ajjawi was "deemed inadmissible" by an officer.
A spokesperson for Harvard said the university still hopes Ajjawi will be attend classes this fall.
