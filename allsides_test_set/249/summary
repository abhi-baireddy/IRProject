A New Jersey National Guard member is the first U.S. service member to die from COVID-19, Fox 29 in Philadelphia reports.
Douglas Linn Hickok, a resident of Pennsylvania, died Saturday at a hospital in his home state, New Jersey Gov.
"Our thoughts are with his wife, children and their family," Murphy said.
"The news of this loss strengthens our resolve to work ever more closely with our interagency partners to stop the spread of COVID-19."
Hickok's death was not part of New Jersey's official coronavirus count because he was a Pennsylvania resident and died in that state, Murphy said.
