"Sorry, he completely deserves this, and he is one of the worst PMs we've ever had," Oakes noted in a comment, BBC News reported.

For starters, the Amber Valley Labour Group said it had withdrawn the whip, meaning Oakes is no longer a Labour councillor, the outlet said.
What's more, Oakes lost her paralegal job in the wake of her comment, BBC News reported in a separate story.
VHS Fletchers Solicitors told the outlet it became "embroiled in criticism" after Oakes' words got around and that she's "no longer employed by this firm in any capacity."
