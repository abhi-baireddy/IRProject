While American hospitals scramble to find enough personal protective equipment (PPE), the USAID department – which gives away over $20 billion year – just gifted a substantial amount of equipment to the nation of Kazakhstan.
This equipment is part of the United States government’s early assistance to Kazakhstan to prepare for the potential spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19.
In addition to the PPE, USAID has also allocated additional funding to support Kazakhstan’s response to COVID-19.
The PPE provided by USAID includes 10,000 examination gloves, 10,000 masks, 1,400 isolation gowns, and 200 protective goggles.
Meanwhile, hospitals across the United States and in allied nations are begging for PPE.
