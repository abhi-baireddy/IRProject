WASHINGTON â€” Chief Justice John Roberts offered a rare rebuke of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday after the New York Democrat made what Roberts called "threatening statements" against two conservative justices.
Schumer had spoken outside the Supreme Court earlier in the day as the justices were hearing a case about a Louisiana abortion law.
"This is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer," Trump said.
A Schumer spokesperson pushed back on the chief justice's rebuke, accusing Roberts of following a "deliberate misinterpretation" of Schumer's remarks.
"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges," Roberts said in a statement at the time.
