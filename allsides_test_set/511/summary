Facing a shortage of coronavirus tests in his state, Maryland Gov.
Larry Hogan (R) moved quickly to secure 500,000 tests from South Korea, a feat he accomplished with the help of his wife, Yumi Hogan.
He praised his wife, who was born in South Korea, for her assistance, saying she "not only used her native language to help secure the tests but also helped negotiate the deal."
Data compiled by the Covid Tracking Project shows that so far, the United States has conducted more than 3.5 million coronavirus tests.
Hogan, he added, "could've saved a lot of money ... he needed to get a little knowledge, that would've been helpful."
