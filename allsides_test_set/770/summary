"I can tell you that there were plans that were being made and Soleimani was in the midst of that plotting," O'Brien told Fox News' "Fox and Friends."
In recent months, Iran has downed several drones, attacked Saudi Arabia's ARAMCO, and taken several other actions, and President Donald Trump has been "very restrained," said O'Brien.
They took that as a sign of weakness...they made a bad mistake in how they read his restraint, which was admirable."
Meanwhile, Soleimani also had been heavily involved from the early days in Iran's nuclear program, said O'Brien, and was not to be traveling outside Iran because of United Nations sanctions.
His death will have an "effect" on the nuclear program, as will the Trump administration's policy of peace through strength, he added.
