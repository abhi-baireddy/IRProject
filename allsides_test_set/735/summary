Were I President Trump, I would have fired Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt a few months ago.
The real measure of the administrative state's overreach is its dramatic cost on American workers and jobs.
Indeed, driven by the donations of billionaires like Tom Steyer and negatively affecting the poorest the most, the administrative state is cronyism of a kind Pruitt might otherwise be proud.
They don't know so because much of the give and take of the administrative state takes place behind the scenes.
Indeed, it was a betrayal of the trust the American people are asked to vest in our politicians.
