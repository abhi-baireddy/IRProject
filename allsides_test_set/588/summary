New York's governor is now calling for help to stem the state's "staggering" rise of coronavirus hospital patients.
The White House has extended social distancing guidelines for another 30 days as health experts warn the peak in the death rate is likely to hit in roughly two weeks.
"If the metros and rural areas don't take care now, by the time you see it, it has penetrated your community pretty significantly," Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, told NBC News.
"I encourage you to use this time at home to get back into the Word, to read our Bibles and spend time with our families," Lindell said at the White House Monday.
The White House says help is on the way after lawmakers passed the $2 trillion aid package last Friday.
