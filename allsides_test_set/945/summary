President Donald Trump listens as Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams gives a speech at a National African American History Month reception at the White House in Washington, D.C., February 13, 2018.
(Leah Millis/Reuters)Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Wednesday rejected the provision of supervised injection sites, facilities where people can inject themselves with illegal drugs under medical supervision, as a response to the opioid crisis, citing safety concerns.
“The two are different, and we want to optimize the things that we know work before we start having conversations about more controversial interventions,” Adams said, adding that he encourages providing drug users with the overdose reversal drug naloxone, which needle exchange sites distribute.
Deaths from opioids increased about 8 percent from 1999 to 2013, and then spiked 70 percent from 2013 to 2017 as the crisis spun out of control.
Opioids caused 47,600 deaths in 2017, at which point the White House declared the opioid epidemic a public-health crisis.
