An appeals court upheld a lower court ruling on Tuesday, ordering the Justice Department to give the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee access to secretive redacted grand jury materials contained within former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.
Circuit ruled in a 2-1 vote to uphold U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell’s October 2019 ruling that House investigators should be given access to the grand jury material redacted within and underlying Mueller’s report.
The dissenter was Judge Neomi Rao, who joined the court after an appointment from President Trump in 2019.
The Democrat-led House impeached Trump on Dec. 18, and the GOP-controlled Senate acquitted the president on Feb. 5.
After all, the Committee sought these materials preliminary to an impeachment proceeding and the Senate impeachment trial has concluded,” she said in her 45-page dissent.
