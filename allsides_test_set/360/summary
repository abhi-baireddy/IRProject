Mark Levin blasted what he called a "rogue CIA agent's" whistleblower complaint against President Trump over his phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.
Levin said the complaint should be taken lighter than it is, claiming Thursday on "Hannity" that no individual with first-hand knowledge of the call's contents filed the same inquiry.
"A CIA agent who is a policy guy for Ukraine can't write something like this," he said.

Isn't it funny -- not a single one of the people with firsthand knowledge [of the call] filed a whistleblower complaint?"
