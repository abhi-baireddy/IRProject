The United States has reached a grim milestone in the fight against coronavirus, passing Italy to become the country with the most deaths in the world.
A tally by Johns Hopkins University showed Saturday that 18,860 people have now died in the U.S. since the start of the outbreak.
On Saturday, 2,108 people died in the U.S. in the past 24 hours – the first country in the world to record more than 2,000 deaths in a single day.
However, experts on the White House’s coronavirus task force suggested the outbreak within America’s borders is starting to level off slowly.
The state has been the worst hit in the country, with 8,627 deaths as of Saturday.
