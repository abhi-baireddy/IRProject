United States and coalition forces have launched retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq.
The Friday strikes, which began at about 1 a.m. local time, followed an attack on Taji camp, a base that houses U.S. forces.
“The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said.
The Pentagon said in its statement after the retaliatory attack that the strikes were meant to be a deterrent to further aggression.
The death led to a tit-for-tat series of events that ended with Iran directly targeting bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq.
